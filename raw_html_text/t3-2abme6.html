                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes at home we want to play table tennis, but there's no one to play with. Or, we're looking to practice but humans get bored doing multiball for others. T3* allows us to do all this by ourselves!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    T3* allows us to train our table tennis strokes, forehand, backhand, sidespin, lobs, low hits, etc. It allows us to play table tennis alone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Arduino microcontroller as the brains and used dual wheel launchers as our method of throwing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Multiple of our 3D printing requests got rejected so our throwing wheels are not circular which are not efficient throwers. We ended up wrapping duct tape in many many layers to try to make a circle.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We finished the hardware and it worked other than the lack of certain parts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to build things and code things and use Arduino.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for T3*
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to 3D print the throwing wheel and the funnel so it will work better. Also, we need to program more functionality and add motor controllers, which we have 0 of currently.
