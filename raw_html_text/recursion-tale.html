                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by Virtual Reality and Game Development Club.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a game in which the player puts actions into a queue to help guide the game avatar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity and our own assets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us were new to Unity, so we had to learn a lot along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the assets we created for the game and the fact that while we only created two levels, we have the foundations to make many more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about using Unity.
