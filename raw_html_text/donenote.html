                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Too often our attention goes towards taking notes, instead of understanding what we're writing. That changes with DoneNote.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It automatically transcribes the words of your professor and summarizes them into a concise overview for future studying.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Bing's API for Speech-to-Text Recognition, and we hosted it using Microsoft Azure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally tried making a java applet, but ran into issues implementing external APIs like Watson and Aylien.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As an inexperienced team, we are proud of the way we adapted to using new languages and environments as we ran into issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For many of us, it was our first Hackathon and our first time using technologies like javascript and Azure, so we learned a lot about how different technologies interact and the importance of adaptability.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DoneNote
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Moving forward, we'd like to continue learning about these technologies and to implement the additional features that we had originally intended to be a part of DoneNote.
