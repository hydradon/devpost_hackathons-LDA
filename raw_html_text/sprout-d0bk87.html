                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were deeply concerned by the rising struggles of third world farmers who are exploited by multinational corporations of their labor. These people are often undercut to the point of being relegated to modern slavery, often because they lack the resources to demand a livable wage. We wanted to give the hard workers a chance of social mobility, and have a helping hand in the form of a mobile app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because these people often do not possess a smartphone of the typical android or IOS type, which are far too expensive, we decided to develop this app on KiaOS, an operating system commonly found on very cheap phones, some of which go as low as 17 dollars. This way, our app can be accessible to those commonly overlooked by the progress of technology and other app developers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is a compilation of resources that would be beneficial to low-income farmers in third world nations, but as for now its primary feature is to calculate a good Fairtrade price to sell their crops. It lists the expected selling price as well as expected revenues given the characteristics inputted by the farmer. It also has an assortment of other features that would help these people, such as a catalogue of banks to which one can deposit money. This app is meant to be a foot in the door to financial literacy for those who have never had such an opportunity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript on top of KiaOS to create this application.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite KiaOS being a common operating system, there weren't many resources to get started, and setting up the development environment was unexpectedly difficult as it ran on a deprecated version of Firefox. There were few guides in English, and none of us had any experience dealing the operating system. However, we managed to figure out the system, and development went out on full speed after that.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all very proud of ourselves, as we know that what we are doing can make a significant impact in someone else's life. Also, we've never worked all night on a project like this together, and we created an app for an operating system that many of us have never even heard of. We came up with an equation to calculate the appropriate selling prices given past data and the Fairtrade database, which we incorporated in the app. The app doesnt even look too bad to boot, given it was written in vanilla HTML and CSS.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We definitely learned a lot about ourselves! Some people became leaders, some people graphic designers, and others backend wizards. It was surprising how long it took to make HTML and CSS templates, especially given that we weren't sure if Bootstrap would be supported on the bare bones OS. We also had to determine a good equation that would ensure that people got the price that they deserved, and that took a lot of research and number crunching!

a) calculate income from all sources, including your primary job and any additional income you earn on the side.
