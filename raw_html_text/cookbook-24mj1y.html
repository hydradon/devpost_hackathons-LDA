                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Deciding what to eat can sometimes be a problem, and this app was created to partially eliminate some of the decision making by narrowing down possible choices based on ingredients.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CookBook takes in user input for ingredients, then finds possible meals that you can make, sorted by the percentage of ingredients missing. Additionally, users can narrow down their choices even more, by typing in tags such as "italian" or "dessert".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built CookBook by creating a databases of common recipes, then searching through the database to find possible meals. Possible meals were added to ArrayLists then outputted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Designing the Recipe class was quite challenging, as we had to plan out our whole project and think about the data and fields that the class needed. Time was also a factor, as we changed ideas midway through the hackathon.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team, we are proud of being able to create a practical program in a limited time, using knowledge and techniques that we learned in our classes at TJ.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about designing classes for real life situations and manipulating data in a database. We also learned more about the advantages and disadvantages of certain data structures as we experimented with different data structures, such as Queues and ArrayLists.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CookBook
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we plan to expand the database to include more recipes, as well as streamline and improve the user interface, possibly incorporating Yext's conversational UI technology.
