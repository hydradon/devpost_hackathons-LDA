                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My bad habit of doing assignments last minute.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It has two components: An Android app for the students, and a computer program for the teachers.  Using the computer program, the teachers can input their subject/course information and the homework they have assigned for that day, and generate a QR code that will be displayed on the screen.  The students then use the app to scan the QR Code, which will then prompt them to select a time for when they want to do it.  The app will then remind the students of the homework, at the time they selected.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Android Studio and Java for the app, and I used a  Java Swing GUI for the teacher's software.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first, I overcomplicated the design of the software, which led to great amounts of confusion and frustration, which then led me to abandon this idea, and almost tackle a completely new one.  Then, I realized that it was possible to make this easier, while still maintaining its functionality and usefulness.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was proud of it when I tested the app and it worked for the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that I should never give up because I almost abandoned this idea, which would not have been successful if I did.

                    What's next for QR Homework Reminder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I need to make the UI look better because right now, it is too simple and vague.
