                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever tried to learn to drive a car in the city? Have you ever had to PAY for EXTREMELY overpriced driving lessons to just show you the basics which you could have picked up on your own?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well, Carlo Motion makes it SIMPLE and CHEAP to learn how to drive. It teaches you the 3 main focuses of driving: turning and accelerating, parallel parking, as well as merging into highway traffic.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Unity and many different assets like Leap Motion and Oculus, we built an immersive experience through the wonderful help of our mentors.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't really know Unity all that well so it was a challenge in and of itself. Having to learn something so broad and tinker with it over a short amount of time taught us you really should be efficient with your time.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that we got the cardboard version of the app to work, even in its simplest form. It was really a challenge to use Unity especially since it was on a mac and even tinker with Oculus on mac.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that if you want to win, you should have SOME experience in the language you want to program in but hey it's not that necessary, We also learned that asking for help is extremely beneficial and you can never go wrong doing so.
