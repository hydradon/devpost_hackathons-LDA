                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration is that we wants to put out information about schools so children can pick the right one so they can have a bright future, and for schools  to improve. One of our people in our group was more inspire because they had a problem with their sibling being bullied and when they were looking at the school, it had no good reviews on it because it was main old reviews and that of the people working in the school, giving good reviews, so now they wish to have stop that but they had no information or to warn other people .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It informs the people looking at the school and it informs the school on how the people feel about the school and how to improve on their school system. It allows the child or the parent to look at the comments on abrader point of view.
