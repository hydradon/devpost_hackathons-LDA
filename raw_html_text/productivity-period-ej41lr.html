                    For an individual user: This extension tracks the amount of time you spend on websites. It classifies a website as &lsquo;good&rsquo; or &lsquo;bad&rsquo; based on your inputs. You allocate a time period to do work, and the extension does the rest! But don&rsquo;t think you can fool the system by just pretending to be on a website; this extension tracks how active you are! You can also track your data later and see the difference.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For a group: Either you or your friend creates a room and gets a shareable invite link. Join the room and work away! In the end, the extension generates a productive to distracted ratio and declares a winner!
