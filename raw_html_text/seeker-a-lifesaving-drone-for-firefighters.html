                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the compassion of humanity to help each other in times of need. First responders face dangerous and life-threatening situations every day for the sake of helping others. We would like to help first responders around the world by lessening the threats they face each day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Seeker is a drone controlled by a PS4 controller. It utilizes a raspberry pi camera module in order to transmit a first person view of its surroundings directly to its operator. The live stream features both a regular view and a thermal camera, which helps locate people who may be obscured by rubble. It also has a compass module integrated into it, allowing for directional tracking based in inputs and movement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an basic Arduino robotics chassis, combined with a PS4 controller for remote control and a raspberry pi with a camera module and an Adafruit thermal camera. Additionally, a wood piece was used to mount an Adafruit compass module. We powered the system using motor drivers and a combination AA batteries and cell phone power banks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Seeker required complex multi platform coding in order to work properly, and due to its weight, the small DC motors used had difficulty propelling the chassis forward. A mapping feature utilizing the compass was scrapped due to time constraints.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to successfully get the majority of the features of the seeker operational.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That integration of different platforms and coding languages can be more challenging then first expected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Seeker: A lifesaving drone for first responders
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Stronger motors, a better power supply system, a more integrated visual system, and a flame retardant casing would theoretically allow Seeker to be deployed by first responders
