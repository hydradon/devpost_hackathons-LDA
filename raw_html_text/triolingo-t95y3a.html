                    From our experience of language learning, we found that often times the new language does not retain if we do not use it often enough. Therefore, we developed this chrome extension so that users can customize their own vocabularies and see those words replaced in their native language environment.  The users can slowly expand vocabularies at their own pace and seeing the new language used in their browsing experience will help users familiarize with these words and learn the language better.
