                            Carlos Coca: In past interactions with friends that are physicians and doctors, I have asked them questions on what they would like to see an improvement on. A couple of them have expressed that the methods and tools that are used to perform visual acuity exams are not the best. In those conversations I identified a problem: hardware/software used to conduct visual acuity exams is very expensive and inconvenient. The solution that I came in mind, is a solution that can be sustainable and applicable at a global scale. The solution consisted on building an interface that is not invasive towards the patient, that the physicians and ophthalmologist can use to conduct visual acuity exams. This interface is meant to only display the "canvases" that are needed to perform specific exams like: Snellen Test, EnChroma Color Blindness Test, Tumbling E, etc. 
The goal is to develop a product that will create a market competition against the current ophthalmology hardware equipment and to be humanitarian by building a tool that can reshape the way that physicians could provide assistance to humans. The interface can revolutionize the accessibility and efficiency to conduct visual acuity tests.

                    The theme for this Hackathon is "Art Edition," "Code a Masterpiece." We saw the opportunity to incorporate art techniques into this project. For example, in the Color Blindness section, instead of using the regular numbers and letters to be identified, we decided to modify art pieces with actual code instead. We saw the opportunity that we could use Processing to create our own and unique tools to manipulate images.

                        Image Editing: Built Image Manipulation tools using Processing: 1) Tool 1: Allows to change the color of the image by pixel ; 2) Tool 2: This tool allows the user to load an image, and with the established controls, the user is able to draw on top of the image. Once the user is done drawing, then the user can export the code that will display the image that the user drew. We also used Adoble Illustrator and Photoshop

                            Carlos Coca: To be able to set all the colors in an image to change to a specific set of numbers. We were not able to register out domain because at first the redeem code did not work and then we never got an email from with the confirmation. So I went to my university (Trevecca University) and I spin up a VM on a server, downloaded Apache to host the website, but in the end, I was never able to successfully host the website at my university. The idea was to spin it up there and access to it here at Vanderbilt premisses. I also had difficulty in maintaining proper content fluidity. JavaScript was also challenging to use. Balancing being a mentor and a hacker. 
Liza Rodriguez: Time period, co-working with different technology, responsive web-design
Gavin Swofford: Staying awake, working through problems on tensor flow
