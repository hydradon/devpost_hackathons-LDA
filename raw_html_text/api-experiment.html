                    wanted to make a website and try new things i have never worked with before. Table 26

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows you to have a website that is connected to you spotify account. it can play music and it will allow you to send emails through sparkpost when you like a piece of music
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    i used namecheap to set up my domain. i made an account using the domain. i used spotify api and sparkpost api to get most of it done.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything since I hadn't worked with any of the stuff I worked with and i was working alone. The hardest part i think is figuring out what certain things do and trying to tailor something towards what you want to do.
