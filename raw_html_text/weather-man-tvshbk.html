                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hate waking up not knowing what to wear to work! I have to scroll so much (my finger hurts!) and there might suddenly be rain or sleet at the end of the workday that I have to take into consideration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It analyzes weather data from your location and let's you know what clothing you should wear according to your own temperature preferences.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Swift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to learn swift and Xcode on the fly. There were issues with the UI and Xcode being inconsistent and unreliable.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We finished a whole application that you can put on your phone!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned so much about swift and APIs in just one day.
                </p>

                    What's next for Weather Man
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd love to add in the extra functionality to add custom items that are unique to the user's wardrobe!
