                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Apps these days focus on entertaining the individual. We spend our days staring at our screen, oblivious to the world around us. Growing increasingly antisocial, we are losing the bonds that made us strong. This app seeks to help us become more aware of the world and its people. By connecting those who need help and those who are able to, we are rebuilding the relationship between fellow human beings.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It quickly connects those who need help and those who are able to provide help.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front end of the app was written in Java intended to run on Android devices. The back-end use Azure servers.
