                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Absence of effective tool for global water bodies and their dynamics.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Calculates the extent and volume of water bodies globally.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created the product by using two datasets: 1- Satellite observations of the reflectance 2- Satellite observations of elevetation (topography of the earth)

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The data size is huge (13 TB) so we needed to think of eefficient ways of dealing with this large dataset
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have successfully implemented what we had in mind and visualized the data on a web platform that could enefit the decision makers and public about their environment and water resources.

                <p>
                    We would like to dessiminate our product and results as a publication in a peer-reviewed journal.
