                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As travel enthusiasts, we all had the similar problem of being unable to choose a 'dream' vacation- other websites we had found were based around questions that we felt were too broad and impersonal. With Holiday, we strove to provide a way for people to get their perfect vacation by factoring in not just their vacation preferences, but their personality using the Meyer Brigs test.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Holiday is a HTML-based website that suggests the ideal vacation spot(s) for the user according to their Meyer Briggs personality type.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap Library to design the website. We also imported Google Maps API to produce a map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Google Maps API was the most difficult feature to work with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of succeeding in using the Google Maps API and the end product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use APIs and how to make an interactive website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Holiday
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We may add more features and publish it if it receives enough interest today.
