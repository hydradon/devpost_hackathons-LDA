                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Whenever there is a natural disaster, the most important task to do is to make sure everyone is okay. This said, if the natural disaster causes the local area to not have access to the internet, this communication is extremely inefficient. We hope to make this process less painful for everyone looking to check on their friends and family.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a hardware device that enables the users to have a long-range communications device without the need for wifi or Bluetooth. It uses the rfm69 module to send data between raspberry pis. We also have an app that allows the user to use their phone to communicate with the pis and the network via Bluetooth.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it by connecting two Raspberry Pi's using rfm69 transceiver modules in order to send data between them. We used Python in order to make these connections. For the phone application,  we used Android Studio to create from scratch a hassle-free messaging app that will make it easy to broadcast a message to everyone in the surrounding area or a local official. To connect the app and the linked raspberry pi's we used android Bluetooth sockets and pyBluez Bluetooth Python library on the Pi.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we had to make a connection between the Raspberry Pi's using the RFM transceivers to even attempt to start sending any information between them, establishing that connection was one of the first tasks. We didn't expect this part to be as difficult as it was, but it took most of the first day of Hack-a-Bull for the one task.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for eMesh.io
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every project, such as this one, is a chance to better the community by either bringing them together or furthering our accomplishments. In eMesh.io I hope to think of a new project that will do exactly that.
