                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group wanted to do something related to natural disasters. With the recent wildfires in our state of California, we figured to do a game based off of fighting fires.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fight fires in Virtual Reality by picking up a hose with an endless stream of water. But what happens when you let go of the hose? Try it out, we promise it's fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Unity and with the help of UCSD's VR club mentors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to decide on a final project idea took quite some time at the beginning but we were glad we settled on this idea. We also had problems figuring out the Particle System. We had two particles, one for fire and the other for water, we needed to figure out how to extinguish the fire particles. Also, we struggled with the construction of the hose. Hinged Joints was very difficult to implement and the mentors told us to work around it instead.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing the game on time and the water particles are able to extinguish the fire particles. Also, our title, because It's Lit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The important difference between collisions and event triggers. We were working hard on the water particles extinguishing the fire particles on collision. However, using Unity's standard particle system, it was best to have it be extinguished using event triggers. Also, we learned that there is always a way to hack around an issue. It is best to get the core functionalities working instead of trying to get the cool extra stuff done. Finally, it's a nice reminder that when building VR, keep the user experience in mind and simple is almost always the best option.
                </p>
