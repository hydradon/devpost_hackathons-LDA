                    I recently encountered a zip file that could be recursively extracted infinitely, which got me intrigued in how one could achieve something like that. I thus dedicated my time this hackathon to learning about data compression and quines, in hopes I could create a compressed archive file (i.e.
                    <code>
                        .zip
                    </code>
                    ,
                    <code>
                        .tar.gz
                    </code>
                    ).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I learnt about the use of:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Lemepl-Ziv algorithms
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Huffman coding
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        DEFLATE compression specification
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Checksums
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Quirks in file binary data (little-endian, headers and footers, etc.)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    All of these account for the necessary items to understanding how popular data archives are stored and made.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the end, I was nearly there, but the problem of having recursive checksums meant I needed to do some fancy algebra to find a CRC value that would equate appropriately in both the header and data section of an archive file. And so I ran out of time and couldn't get it working completely :(
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am however very happy with the progress I made and will attempt to create a streamlined solution, like a Python package that adds a layer of abstraction to the "recursive archive problem" that can be then applied to the specifics of the provided by file types like
                    <code>
                        zip
                    </code>
                    and
                    <code>
                        rar
                    </code>
                    .
                </p>
