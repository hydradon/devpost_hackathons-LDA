                    Problem: The problem we are solving is health risks posed by certain species of mosquitoes and nuisance of invading mosquitoes due to not having a reliable, flexible and smart solution to control and manage mosquitoes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vision: A network of smart, flexible and autonomous devices that predicts the most effective time, location and technique to repel mosquitoes with minimum energy consumption and no impact on environment!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Solution details: 
  o A model development using state-of-art techniques in Artificial Intelligence to prioritise identified areas and trigger the smart repellent device to deter mosquitoes from that area based on the data collected through the App and other sources (i.e. Newcastle Council&rsquo;s network of sensors).
  o Multiple repellent methods will be used at the same time to ensure different types of the mosquitoes will be pushed back from the dedicated area. These techniques will be evaluated over the time to ensure the optimum results are achieved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Core foundation of solution: 
  o Data analysis using artificial intelligence techniques. Utilising multiple techniques to physically repel mosquitoes. 
  o Our proposed solution works for any area with mosquito problem specifically if identification of mosquito type is difficult and removing them from the environment is not an option. In this case, our proposal will work perfectly at the university of Newcastle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Technology Readiness: Our proposal is leveraging following available technologies:
  o Proven repellent methods and equipment 
  o Data collection through crowd data acquisition (mobile app) and other identified sensors (temperature, humidity and wind speed) including 2-way communication devices in the network to feed to AI and also provide a better picture to other researchers 
  o Artificial Intelligence and data analysis techniques 
  o Interactive mobile applications
  o Available low cost and reliable method of communication between devices and data centre.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How to test the proposal: 
  o Considering the selected methods of repelling are proven useful (for short ranges) we based our design on the proven technology,
  o Trial the minimum viable product on site (to be approved by Newcastle University)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Experimental Plan: 
  o Develop interactive mobile app to collect data from the crowd (3 months)
  o Connect to Newcastle City Council LoRawan system and collect data currently available including historical data
  o Data analysis and pattern recognition through Artificial Intelligence techniques (3 to 6 months)
  o Assemble one MVP (3 to 6 months)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Future Phase: 
  o After successful implementation of the MVP, the plan is to manufacture more equipment (at least 10) through additional funding
  o Further develop mobile app
  o Development of AI based multi-agent systems and coordinated control of devices
                </p>
                <p>
                    Funding progress plan:
  o 3rd party costs for mobile app development: $2,500 &ndash; 3 months
  o Procurement for MVP: $2,500 &ndash; 3 to 6 months
  o Access to Newcastle Council LoRawan: Free (confirmed by Newcastle Council)
  o Access to environmental parameters (Temperature, Humidity and possibly wind speed): leveraging Newcastle Council sensors, Free (confirmed by Newcastle Council)
  o Cloud server and AI development: Project team, no costs
  o Trials: Project team, no costs
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outcome in Testing Phase: 
  o Interactive mobile app to collect crowd data
  o One MVP
  o A decision-making model for mosquito&rsquo;s population/density in the area
  o Trial site installation of MVP
                </p>
                <p>
                    What we have done to date:
  o Liaised with Newcastle Council and leveraging their experience in;
   Smart Poles
   LoRawan
   Data collection sensors 
  o Literature search to find best methods and equipment for repelling mosquitoes
  o Similar predicting model for a different application
  o Similar mobile app for a different application
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our unique idea: we believe our approach is unique because:
  o There is no predictive model using AI to forecast availability of mosquitoes in different time of a day, or in a day of year.
  o Our Smart Repellent equipment uses existing technology but smarter in order to save energy and maintenance costs and at the same time, detects the most effective time and location to repel mosquitoes
  o Interactive approach, so crowd can feed in to the predictive model, so they can see immediate results, like never before!
