                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started out with a rag tag team that truly met here for the very first time even though we all attend the same university. Passionate about our generation and the gaming we grew up with we decided to pay aumage to the past and create a game based on games we love.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a multiplayer game loosely based on bomberman, however we quickly realized we wanted to make our own mark on a simpler more infuriatingly addicting game of wits.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized Unity, some for the very first time, in every aspect of the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first hackathon any of us had attended and the first time we used the Unity Engine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The knowledge we gained and implemented in such a short time was incredible. We may not have made the best game of the century but we made a game we will be playing amongst each other for the years to come as we approve upon what weve started here.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that anyone can create a product that they can be proud of in such a motivational enviroment. Each person can learn from one another and bring a great deal to the table if they are given the opportunity.
                </p>

                    What's next for Knock Out Void
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to launch the game after further improvement on public gaming platforms.
