                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My brother is a competitive long-distance runner who worries a lot about keeping an even pace and loves music.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app simulates a "heart rate". App speeds up and loudens a song when your heart rate is too low. It slows and quiets song if the heart rate is too high.  If the "heart rate" is consistently high the less upbeat and intense song is selected for the next song. If heart rate is too low the app selects the other more intense song.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used bootstrap, javascript, and HTML, along with swift and WebView for the mobile application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I started quite late in the hackathon. I spent a lot of time learning IOS. I spent too many hours worrying about API's.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I love the idea and the app does quite a few complex audio and playback operations. The project was more difficult to do by myself.  I proud of starting Swift as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about Swift, WebViews, and how to work with music in HTML5
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HEART MUSIC
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would love to include the actual Fitbit API.
I would also like to interview my brother again and see what features he finds annoying vs helpful.
