                <p>
                    On the way here, two of the developers wanted to rideshare because they were unable to reserve a spot on the bus to the hackathon. In this tragedy, they quickly shored up their intelligence to find an alternative. And that alternative was ridesharing since they did not know enough about the advanced public transportation
                </p>

                    Rising Action
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The two quickly arrived at a dilemma: what ridesharing service should they use? They had used Uber and Lyft before, but in their short experience, these services had huge fluctuations and choosing one over the other was a nerve-wracking experience. To address this potentially disastrous financial loss for scrappy college students on a budget, we have addressed this issue with our skills and abilities.

                    Our app works but is fragile. However, limited testing on android(2 phones), iOS, Chrome on Windows, Chrome and Safari on Mac has all been suceessful. Just a tad slow because the Google Maps API struggles with the internet in Pauley Pavilion...
