                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was going through example demos on creating Alexa skill sets and found that Alexa needs to use lambda function to give response to specific/similar type question. I was thinking about a skill with various simple question which doesn't require much of processing and, adding new set of question and answer should be as easy as writing down answer for questions in a notebook rather than modifying source code of the skill set. Thats when I got an idea about utilizing Api.AI to add new question and its possible answers.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes different types of question as input and replies by checking for possible answers in Api.AI.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used apiai python module to send intents to Api.AI. apiai module gets response from its server and is used as answer for the question asked to Alexa

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenge I ran into was creating lambda function for the skill. Since the skill requires external python modules like apiai, nump, json, etc. and I had no previous experience with lambda function, I hand to spend lot of time to figure out how to use isolated environment for python with virtualenv to create such function.

                <p>
                    Able to integrate Alexa with Api.AI. Since api.ai is one of its own kind similar to Alexa with its own Natural Language Processing (NLP), it took a good amount of time to plan how to integrate them together to make Alexa even more powerful.

                    After the hackathon I have plans to improve the way Alexa is currently integrated with Api.ai and publish it on the store.
