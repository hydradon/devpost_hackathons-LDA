                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In this modern age, it's still very difficult for the underprivileged individual to reach and communicate with the appropriate volunteers who can help support them through their tough situation. The Support service allows for an individual to sign up via a toll-free number to be matched with a volunteer that could potentially alleviate their situation. For example, if a woman needs help to escape an abusive household, she can text and provide information to the number and using that information, our algorithm will match her to a nearby volunteer who themselves have stated that they would like to help or have experience with abusive cases.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Our goal is to match people's talents to help people's needs.
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believe that a volunteer's strengths should match with the needs of who they are helping and Support is the embodiment of that belief.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Volunteers (known as Supporters) can sign up on our website and after answering a few questions and being approved by the admin, they'll be entered into a database where they'll be matched with people in need. Individuals in trouble can message the service and Support will match the Supporter with the individual based on the volunteer's strengths and the individual's needs. Once there is a match, the service will send the individual description of their problem to the Supporter who can either decline (for example, they don't feel capable of handling the situation) or accept in which a message will be sent to the individual with the phone and email details of the Supporter.
