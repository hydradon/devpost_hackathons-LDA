                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bots are becoming more powerful and conversational these days, allowing users to have mini-assistants for simple tasks. Certain bots act as financial advisors, helping you control your spending. CoinChat takes this a step further, by allowing you to take control of your entire bank account.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    With CoinChat, you can perform transactions, scan and deposit checks, and view your accounts balance and information. This can all be done with a simple conversation with the advanced, and friendly  AI.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Microsoft LUIS, along with the Cognitive Services API to power the bot, training it with different intents and utterances to make it robust. The Capital One API powers the banking functionality, allowing us to open, perform deposits and perform transactions on accounts.

                <p>
                    Integrating LUIS into the application. Setting up Azure. Finding appropriate documentation.
