                    Microsoft Azure Face API, Spotify API, &amp; React We combined Microsoft Azure's Face API, Spotify's API, and React to create a sleek looking website to also be able to still do what we wanted and needed it to do. First Matt Taylor and Jai Jethani worked on the Azure API as Natalie Whitehead started work on the front end with React. Next, Taylor and Jethani worked on the Spotify API to work with the Azure API. Whitehead then combined both in React.
