                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired at first by the idea of leveraging news articles towards a simple web application. We initially envisioned this as a timeline, but due to the nature of the data, we thought it would be better to analyze the data instead by using R.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides an interactive applet to explore our findings, alongside an analysis that contains more in-depth visualizations not covered by the applet, and a friendly homepage to welcome the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized RMarkdown to create the analysis page, HTML, CSS, and Shiny to format these three webpages, and flexdashboard to create the visualization. Primarily utilized RStudio and GitHub during development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The about us page and analysis page were created separately using basic HTML and CSS. All content on these pages were handwritten to showcase our results aside from the main app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Packages, particularly shiny and flexdashboard, were difficult to implement. A multi-paged website was also difficult to create, since shiny primarily creates single-paged websites. R Syntax was difficult to understand compared to our previous programming endeavors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to utilize the shiny package, create effective data visualizations, and focus on better web development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was either the first or second time that all of us worked together to utilize web tools in conjunction with analyzing data, let alone at a hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The R Ladies
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was a text-heavy element per article (the body of the article), so analyzing that part of the data would be useful. In addition, we were unable to implement our own website server in time for this hackathon.
