                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Head-mounted displays mean you no longer need to look at your phone, but you still need to use it to input data.  I wanted to see whether it was possible to build a chorded keyboard (or even just do gesture recognition) using FLIR technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A Lepton is connected to a Beaglebone.  Both are mounted on a wristband and the Lepton points at the hand.  The Beaglebone runs a computer vision algorithm to recognize the pose (and hence keypress) of the hand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I experimented with both an Eigenfaces-based algorithm (which I implemented myself) and OpenCV contour/inflection point algorithms.  I eventually settled on Eigenfaces, with a bit of tweaking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cold fingertips.  Fingertips aren't as warm as your face or the palms of your hands.  As a result, they don't stand out quite as well as I'd hoped.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I designed and had 3D printed a mounting bracket for the camera.  This is the first time I'd designed for a 3d printer (and the first time I'd done any CAD since GCSEs).  Apart from the mounting posts being slightly thicker than I might have liked (fixable with a file), it all went smoothly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also implemented a (slightly simplified) version of the Eigenfaces algorithm for the pose detection.  Although I'd read material on this, I'd never previously implemented it, and I'm glad I got it working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots.  About...
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Lepton - this was the first time I'd used one
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Beaglebone - again, not used one before
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        3D printing (and FreeCAD)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Eigenfaces computer vision algorithm.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    ...and also that the idea works in principle (although quite a lot of refinement is still required).
                </p>

                    What's next for flirkey
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've shown that the idea works in principle, but there's a lot more refinement required to make it both more reliable and to recognize more gestures.  I'm keen to continue working on this, although I suspect I'll need to take a step back and make sure the foundations I'm building on are solid.
