                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all know that the food industry wastes an extremely large amount of food every year, and our group decided to do something about it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connects restaurants with food shelters and soup kitchens so they can donate their unused food. With this app, we ensure food is not wasted and also feed the underprivileged.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML bootstrap and incorporated google maps API into our website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being beginning hackers we weren't really prepared for this type of an environment, and our lack of planning hindered idea development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We honestly did not think we would finish the website, but doing so was definitely an achievement for us
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through this process, we were able to sharpen our coding skill and learn to work together in an efficient manner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Food For All
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make the UI more user-friendly and hopefully roll the website out.
