                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My messy notes and time spent organizing things. A process I felt could be automated and built upon to easily generate study materials so I could spend my time actually learning content instead of organizing it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it would do
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A tool that takes a document or powerpoint presentation in ODF or other document formats and pulls important information from them. This would predominantly be used for organizing notes and generating notes from class powerpoints or personal text files. It would find vocab, main ideas, steps, question, etc using a modifiable config file where you could specify, for instance, how a vocab word is formatted (ie bolded, word - &hellip; and so on).  Then using the pulled data it generates study guides, flashcards, or quizzes.
