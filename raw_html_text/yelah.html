                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a farmer and a techpreneur, i needed an application i can use to communicate with others farmers without the internet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Yelah enables farmers to chat, call,send images and files to each other within the range of 3km to 5km without having internet access.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Yelah was built using javascript and it uses wifi connection,and with intense interaction with other farmers and agricultural stakeholders.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    most farmers have not adapted to technology
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Yelah version 1.0 is ready
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    farmers want to connect, they are always looking for ways to interact directly with others farmers, customers and experts that can help solve their problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Yelah
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we plan to lunch Yelah with a short number of farmers to start with, then we wish to extent it further more to other parts of the country, within a year or more, we plan to scale yelah to other part of the world.
