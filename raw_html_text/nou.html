                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a unique identifier for people based on their habits.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses soft margin support vector machines to cluster and classify people based on their habitual data
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python Sklearn, youtube, trial and error with other neural networks
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Started with recurrent neural networks. Couldn't properly reshape time series into a needed matrix shape. Then realized SVM was actually better
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Made this
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot about python libraries. Not a lot about math
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for noU
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Write in lower level language, C++, for architecture optimization
Include other neural networks for pattern recognition, that contribute to overarching architecture. This allows for better analysis on datatypes we haven't used yet (eg, image data, natural language processing, or denoising audio).
