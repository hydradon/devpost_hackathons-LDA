                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The St. Patrick Center Hackathon. Well...the first one with 7 people. (We had 2 devs show up and 5 "project managers"...you can guess how that turned out.) I learned of the need for rapid rehousing. I've been looking for opportunities to be involved since and knew that there was a way to build an infrastructure on an app to serve multiple needs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CoordinatedSTL allows all members of the CoC to be on the same page about who their clients are and what info is accessible. It also keep track of any Point of Contact that any CoC member has with them. The software allows users to create a location with a certain number of units (rooms) and beds for each unit to properly manager their emergency shelter needs. However, we've built it in a way that it also works for landlords. It equips them with powerful tools that make them want to use the software, find customers, and in turn, make a difference.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent about 60% of our time building out the architecture and databases so the software is rock solid and an incredible foundation. About 30% of our time was spent on data processing and processing languages (php). We spent about 10% on UI, but that was made much b

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team flew over on Wednesday and got sick Friday night as we started coding so that eliminated about 6 to 8 hours of our time.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built something incredibly powerful and incredibly modular.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're from different parts of the world and this is our first "in person" project so we learned how we worked.
                </p>

                    What's next for CoordinatedSTL
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've built this in a way that can be built upon. I (Ryan) have had a vision for this for a long time and have wanted to get involved in this scene.
