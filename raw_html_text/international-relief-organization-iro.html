                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As Hurricane Harvey devastated Houston, many Americans sought to help directly. Without proper structure, these well-meaning people can become a liability. Because of this, Yash and I decided to create a website that will streamline the helping process.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    IRO allows users to sign up for activities created specifically by accredited organizations to support a cause.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a website built with PHP, MySql, HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first and foremost problem we faced as a team was balancing work and play. The wonderful organizers of PennApps did a good job of providing awesome distractions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Penn Apps is our first hackathon. Simply turning in a project is a proud achievement for our team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team of high schoolers, this hackathon has shown us really what kind of independence is granted in college. Through this, we have come to learn the importance of time management.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for International Relief Organization (IRO)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will continue to work on and refine IRO. Although IRO is currently simple program, the implications of this type of application can change how we respond to disasters, natural or otherwise. An application like IRO will allow established organizations to leverage the people's desire to help in a beneficial manner.
