                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration came from our dissatisfaction with standard banking apps and their integration of budgeting
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pluto is a mobile banking application that allows you to virtually divide your savings account into "boxes" which can essentially be considered miniature savings accounts, allowing you to track your savings, such as saving up for a car, more closely.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Nessie API from Capital One to simulate a bank account and the transferrence of money along with DynamoDB from Amazon Web Services to provide a database for storing the information about our "boxes."
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Amazon Web Services and making an effective database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pluto
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope that with more time we will be able to develop Pluto into a fully functional banking app.
