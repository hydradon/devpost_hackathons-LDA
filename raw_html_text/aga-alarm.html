                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to build this app after noticing there weren't many alarms on the App Store that supported Apple Watch in full functionality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Stores alarms that can be called from the phone once completed. The app also sends notifications to the Apple Watch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized XCode for our native iOS project and watchOS project, and Git for source control.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Converting hours and minutes using certain components was a challenge, as was the use of Git. Trying to pick up on Swift after recently learning it was also a heavy roadblock
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The UI and some of our streamlined code are what we feel we accomplished best in this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Development in Swift and in Xcode is incredibly vast and intriguing, but also incredibly deep. Having known Git and Swift a bit better prior to this hackathon would have helped, as well as having more time. It was an incredible experience though.

                    What's next for AGA Alarm
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We may tune up and continue the application and add to its functionality in the future.
