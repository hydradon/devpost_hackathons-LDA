                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to work with cars and develop new technologies to be used in them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It would be connected to your car via Bluetooth and could handle multiple device connections via Bluetooth (up to three). A lot of cars can only support one Bluetooth connection at a time, whereas with our device you could easily switch between several devices within a car.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Java to model the basic operations that would be completed by our device and 3D printing to create a basic model of what our device would look like.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    3D printing was an issue for a little bit, and we had some trouble thinking about how to model the operations of our device with software.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think that we created a pretty cool idea!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    3D printing, the capabilities of NX, and abstracting the operations of a device.
                </p>

                    What's next for NewBlu
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to connect our device to a universal set of cars with Bluetooth.
