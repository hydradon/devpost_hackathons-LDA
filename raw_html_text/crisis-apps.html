                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were interested in disaster relief for those impacted by Hurricances like Dorian and Maria for people that don't know what areas are affected and for first responders that don't know what infrastructure works are damaged and can't deliver appropriate resources in time.

                    This website shows the location of the nearest natural disasters.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Amazon API and Google Cloud and Maps API and Python and Java Script.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have not been to a hackathon before so we weren't sure about how in-depth or general our problem should be. We started with an app that first responders can use during a natural disasters to input vitals

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A website that can map the GPS locations of flood data that we are confident in and a uniquely trained model for urban flooding.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    We learned about Google Cloud APIs, AWS S3 Visual Recognition Software and about how to operate in a hackathon.
