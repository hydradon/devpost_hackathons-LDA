                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to focus on an ecologically-focused data project that could benefit the community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Plots Urbana tree inventory data against  census tracts to allow for analysis of demography, income, property value, and trees present.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Urbana tree inventory data, Census data, and R to put together plots.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Data cleaning and preparation was extremely tough for this project.
Formatting for geotagging was not consistent across different sources such as Urbana, government, and other GIS data sources.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to convert everything, including some strange and arbitrary XY coordinate systems, to latitude and longitude in order to plot our trees onto a map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that data cleaning and prep can be the hardest part of any project :P
                </p>

                    What's next for PygHack CU Trees

                <p>
                    Converting the static plots to dynamic and filterable plots using D3 on an interactive site.
