                    What it does: This app allows girls to see their dresses on a model. By using the app, girls can decide which dress looks best on them before actually going under the hassle of trying them on. This will save them lots of time.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: We learned how to use more complicated features of the coding languages that we used: html, css, and javascript. We originally did not know how to code at all before, but now, we troubleshooted a lot and learned how to use the programming languages to create a functioning program.

                <h2>
                    What we learned: We learned how to use basic coding languages, and we also learned about how to use even more complicated functions. By using these skills, we were able to create a program ourselves.

                    What's next for The Outfit: The next step for the Outfit is to create an algorithm that lets the user know which accessories or clothes match in order to make it easier for the user.
