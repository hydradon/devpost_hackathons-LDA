                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While there are many filters on Instagram, they are usually pre-defined. Even customers can adjust filters, they can only change colour, contrast and several simple options. 
Inspired by the great artists and their masterpieces in human history, along with the most recent development of deep learning and neural networks, we aim to create a webpage that help users to create filters with their beloved art style, or quickly apply multiple pre-trained art filters on their photos.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project has a front-end, user-friendly webpage that allows users to upload an original image and choose multiple art styles out of the four available art styles. Or, they can upload an art image, such as Starry Night, or create their own new style. 
The backend programs contain a convoluted neural network and four pre-trained art models with parameters, adapted from an open source GitHub project. When the original image comes in, the neural network will change the image via backpropagation, until its metric of &lsquo;Style&rsquo; is similar to the pre-trained models.
If the user chooses to create a new art style, the neural network will train the style images in order to create the parameters of the model, which takes a much longer time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML5 to build the framework of ArtFilter and used CSS to style the webpage, successfully providing the users with a cherished opportunity to both view our existing model and design with their own models
We utilized Python scripts, specifically Pytorch for the neural network. The python scripts are from an open source GitHub project about Neural Style Transfer:
                    <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/fast_neural_style" rel="nofollow">
                        https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/fast_neural_style
                    </a>
                    . The algorithm of Neural Style Transfer is based on &ldquo;Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution&rdquo; (Justin Johnson, 2016). 
We utilized Compute Engine with 8 CPUs in Google Cloud Platform, in order to speed up the training process. 
We wrote a bash script to call different functions in the Python scripts so that we can apply multiple filters on one image.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Training a new model with CPUs is relatively slow. Even with Google Cloud with 8 CPUs, it took around 8 hours to train 15.7% of the whole process and estimated 51 hours to train the whole model.
We did not have enough time to integrate the user inputs from frontend with backend programs, but it is achievable if we have more time in the future.
