                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanna do something realz simple but actually hafta put sum effort into.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Play around with snakes in a three 3D environment.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Web Browsers and not with those sucky IDEs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of unclear documentation in three.js. I give a thumbs down for that. There happened to only be one template for our starting point that really fit our needs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did it in 7 consecutive hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How Three.js works conjunction to WebGL.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Snake with Three.js
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AI Snakes!!! Rather than playing snakes, watch them grow themselves in the shortest time possible!
Obviously we need an interface because it really sucks right now without any score keeper. We will be learning more web development and use powerful JS libraries to do this.
