                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A platform to find jobs in the neighborhood.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jobber connects you with people in your neighbourhood. See tasks from other people around you that need doing. You can also put up your own job requests. Need some extra cash on the side and you&rsquo;re good at woodworks? Jobber could connect you with a neighbor two blocks down who needs their fence fixed.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made it using bootstrap and php, incorporating Google Maps into the website. The logo was was designed by us.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first time we had to synergize our energies into figuring out how to efficiently design a website. We initially started making it an app but soon discovered the team didn&rsquo;t have the android dev experience needed to create a good product in an efficient amount of time, so we switched to designing a website.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to accomplish my goals after two sleepless nights fueled only by red bull and a burning passion for coding.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to persevere even under mounting pressure.

                <p>
                    We&rsquo;ll see if we can expand this idea to the next level.
