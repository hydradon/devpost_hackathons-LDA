                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the Halloween season on the horizon, parents throughout the country are going to be taking their children to strangers houses within their community. Due to the unknown nature of the character of people and what they are doing with the candy or even how they behave in front of children parents have resorted to having trick or treating in parking lots. We want children to have fun and go door to door collecting as much candy as they can while their peace have the peace of mind that the neighborhood they will be taking their children to is safe.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web application displays a location and the user can select individual houses or entire neighborhoods and select a safety rating and a general overview of their experience while trick or treating with their children. The ultimate goal is to have a website that parents can use and share their experiences with each other and check on past/current experiences before visiting a particular house or neighborhood.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By using here.com's API we implemented an interactive map on a website provided by domain.com. We attempted to implement a back-end with a server on one of our computers using docker, PHP and SQL.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Back-end coding has been very challenging for our group. Sadly, none of our members are familiar with PHP, docker or SQL, nor here.com's API

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out here.com's API, creating a functional domain, working together as a team, figuring out so much in completely new terrains using API's and back-end coding. Completing our teams' very first hackathon. Having a team that never argued with each other and every member putting forth maximum effort to attempt to get our code completed. Most importantly, coming together as a team and having a great time on a Saturday coding and learning so much in Computer Science

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every member in our team did something new today, members learned how to create a server with their own PC, how to use PHP, learning here.com's API some members learned how to code in JavaScript and HTML/CSS.

                    What's next for TrackOrTreat
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TrackOrTreat needs some polishing in order to be nationwide and effective. For example, the back-end needs to work more properly and its ability to process data is very limited. Hopefully, with more time TrackOrTreat could be a very crucial web application that parents could use to help keep their children safe.
