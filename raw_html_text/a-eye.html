                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea of crossing any street without seeing anything terrified us and we thought of a solution to help blind people to detect iminent threat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A-Eye is designed to detect if an object (a person, a car, a ball, ...) is approching toward a camera that will be placed in the glasses of a blind person or of someone with visual dificulties. The process of the data will be made on his cellphone
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The object's detection is made with the azure computer vision API, a proof of concept was developped in Python 3.6.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning to use the Microsoft API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The whole project ; developping a proof of concept in very  little time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for A-Eye
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developpement of the hardware (glasses) 
Deep leaning program to make the A-eye more smart by defining the right Beep context.
We could also adjust the sensibility of our program to become more effective.
