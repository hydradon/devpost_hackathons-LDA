                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many individuals spend long amounts of time finding parking which in turn delays their main activity of the day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ParkFast maps and displays the list of available spots to the user. It allows the user to cut their time trying to find parking which also reduces traffic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the arduino piece connected with a ultrasonic sensor to detect if a spot is empty. The sensor sends updates via http request and echo location. We used a python queue to store the spots and stored boolean values on whether a spot is empty or not. The API is connected to a GUI web page built with html and javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the arduino to work was definitely a challenge. We had problems setting it up but it was a fun struggle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to get an arduino set up and working with an ultrasonic sensor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt a great lot about IOTs as well as working with arduino.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ParkFast
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to widen the scope of our application and apply it to street parking
We want to implement a book and pay system where users can book and pay for a spot.
