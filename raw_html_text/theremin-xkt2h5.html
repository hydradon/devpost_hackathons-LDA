                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was derived from the amazing and eerie instrument known as the theremin. The theremin works by changing the sounds pitch with one hand and changing amplitude with the other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized the Microsoft band to assist us with creating a theremin like instrument. It works by sensing the rotation in your wrist, and translates that rotation to a specific frequency.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created an android app with Android studio and the Microsoft Band SDK. The phone generates tones based on the rotation of your wrist. The app reads in data from the band's accelerometer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge faced was finding an accurate motion to represent changes in frequency.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made an Android app without knowing how to make Android apps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to make an Android app and combine different software to manipulate hardware.
                </p>

                    What's next for Theremin
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are interested in adding a recording feature to this app, allowing the user to record the music he creates.
