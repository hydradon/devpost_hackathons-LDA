                    Checking the fridge and wasting time determining what you need to buy. Instead of "Add x, y, z, ... to my shopping list", say "ShoppingTime!" and it determines what you need to buy.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Swift -&gt; App where you can take a picture and send it to a server we created with your unique id.
Python -&gt; Handles the image recognition and sends info to Google Vision API, which gives back info.
This info is later processed by our Python Script and it sends a message to our Google Assistant, which lets the user know what needs to be bought.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Collaborations with (a) grocery store company(ies) (Ex: Costco, Loblaws, etc.) where they can prepare the required items and user can either choose pickup or delivery. This speeds up the process of grocery shopping removing the need to search for items and remembering what needs to be bought.
