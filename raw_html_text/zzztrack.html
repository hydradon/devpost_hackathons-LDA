                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by our and our peers' sleep deprivation this past semester.  We hope that people will take sleep more seriously here if they have something that tells them exactly how little time they spend sleeping.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    zzzTrack tracks how long you have been sleeping.  Specifically, it counts how much time has passed between clicking a "sleep" button and a "wake" button.  It is meant to be open as the user is sleeping.  There is an "interrupt" button to pause the timer and a "snooze" button to count time spent half-asleep just before the user gets out of bed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My teammate Annie took care of most of the CSS, while I worked on the Javascript.  The sleep tracker subtracts the date, in milliseconds, between the time each button was clicked.  We used Microsoft Azure to host our website.

                    We didn't know anything about programming before this.  We learned everything we needed to know for this in 2 days.
