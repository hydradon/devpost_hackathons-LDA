                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In my daily experience in Subway I struggle again and a again with not
 knowing the right subway exit for a certain destination.
 We found a lot of Forums who talked about it and already wrote to Google. Since nothing
 changed we knew we have to hack it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ## What it does
 No matter how you got to the subway station, using the right exit reduces the time to get from a to b a lot.
 We provide a platform to replace inaccurate GPS coordinates with exact coordinates.
 For an easier and quicker navigation to not lose time anymore.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ## How we built it
 We build a database with correct GPS coordinates replacing the wrong ones. Then we developed
 an IBM cloud based service to return automatically the right exit for subway stations.

                    ## Challenges we ran into
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        building the database
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        integrating with google maps app and local app.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    ## Accomplishments that we are proud of
 Having a fun night and focusing on the challenge even when tensions got higher.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ## What we learned
 Felix used IBM Bluemix the very first time. Even when we are only able to publish the MVP
 it was a lot of fun to first touch Bluemix.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ## What's next for __AlpineHacks
 Make Subway driving great again!
 We believe using the Subway can be a lot more fun with the right tools.  We will
 persue data products for Subway navigation.
