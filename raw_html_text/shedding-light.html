                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A metaphorical idea about representing a story with mechanics and immersive experience. It was developed from a short story written by Alex Walhout a few years ago.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a short web game
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used impact.js to build the game from the ground up, making our own sprites, sounds, and levels
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using impact.js to form a game with small helper tools and build what we needed with limited time and resources
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game is finished! It represents a whole experience. We learned many things about javascript, impact.js, photoshop, garageBand, and puzzles that we will walk away from accomplished!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building a game is hard work, it takes cooperation from all parts of a team and a mindset and stick-to-intuitiveness that is difficult to sustain. We learned how to work well and efficiently together and how to make a genuine art form come to life from concept to completion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Shedding Light
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to expand the game, fix bugs, and refine sprite work to make the best creative and intellectual product possible.
                </p>
