                    Our original Sensors and servos were locked in the Ricoh office and we had no access to them. This led our team into a 24-hour period of unexpected challenges, troubleshooting, and much googling.

                <p>
                    During this time we were faced with the following crises:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        no real working sensors for the first 5 hours
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        getting the teensy bootloader to work
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        getting sensors to send data without interrupting each other
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        understanding quaternions
                    </p>

                        turning raw sensor data into quaternions  (Thank You, Kris Winer)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        processing quaternions

                        dealing with quaternion problems
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        wires interfering with the magnetometer's sensing
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The sensors were not completely neutral
                    </p>
