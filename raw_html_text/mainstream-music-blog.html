                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to learn and create a website because we had an interest in sales.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is just a blog for giving personal opinions on new and old music.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used notepad++ to code in html and css.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first time we have ever done anything to do with coding and memorizing the different inputs were difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not give up even though we had to restart the whole process over again.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned coding and many other new things outside of coding such as the importance of time management and teamwork.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mainstream: Music Blog
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to take lessons we learned from creating this website and improve for the next site we decide to code.
                </p>
