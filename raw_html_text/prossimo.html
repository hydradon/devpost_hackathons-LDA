                    Inspiration for Prossimo. We all have had experiences waiting to get a haircut. Spending two hours twice a month for something that really takes 30 minutes to do is a tremendous waste of time especially in a day in age where we try to fit 60 hours of work into a 40 hour week.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How it works. Prossimo works by the barber having a set schedule and then their clients selecting spots that work for them and the barber's schedules.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into. Writing out a business plan to figure out how to best fit the needs of both the barber and customer. Two sides to the market as if the customers do not download application, then barbers will not subscribe and vice-versa.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of. Getting this app off the ground. We have been working very hard to get as much as we can into the app and therefore are very excited with what has been done in 36 hours.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned. We have learned how to maximize our strengths and minimize weaknesses. Some of us can code, some of us cannot, some of us prefer presenting, others are better at crafting a pitch, and so on.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Prossimo. Just launched a site for the app and some social mediums. Also interviewed with a reporter and hopefully can get some free press out of that as well later on tonight.
