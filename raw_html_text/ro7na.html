                    it all started with a trip with my friends, we went in the car visit three different places, we noticed that there is a lot of pictures of lost children or mentaly retarded people, and we thought why there is no application to help those families to find their members quickly, we heard about LHD and it is a chance to start realizing this idea
                </p>
                <h2>
                    what it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    findTheLost is a simple application that allows families to post a picture of their lost child (or any one of the family) and search among the pictures of found people posted before, if someone found a lost child in the street for example, he takes a picture for him and post it in the app, findTheLost will compare the image posted with the children's pictures posted by families (using azure face recognition services) , if there is a high ressemblance rate, the app will notify the family about it, and send them the picture posted with the information of the person that posted it,
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we build it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we decided to realize this idea as a mobile application, for this we choosed ionic 3 to make it multiplatforme, and we used azure api to make image processing and face recognition, consuming this api using asp.net core
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we had a some difficulties in connecting our ionic app to the asp.net backend
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we feel great because we are building a tool that can be helpful and spread the happiness in the society.

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    A team work skills in first place, also we learned the powerfull services that azure offers

                    What's next for findTheLost
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we planning to develop this app to be used by the police because when any one find a lost kid they take him to the police but the problem is the kid doesnt know his family, so it's difficult to define his identity.
