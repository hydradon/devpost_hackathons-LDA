                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We both love video games and thought we should finally make one ourselves!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Puzzle Adventure Game is a game where you find yourself on a world with a key(s) scattered around that you must find to unlock the portal to get to the next world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this game by using assets from the Unity Asset Store, creating our own assets, and writing scripts in C# to get everything to work together cohesively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into difficulties trying to get the map to layer correctly to give a correct representation of our isometric map. Only one of us knew C# so it took some time to help the other learn the language for all of the scripts we needed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we never gave up after encountering problem after problem. Making a game is not something we are familiar with so we are happy that we went out of our comfort zone and tried something new.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From the project we now have a better understand of Unity and C# and how they both work together!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for rosehack2020
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add more levels and detail to the levels to make it more aesthetically pleasing. We would also add more interesting and complex ways to obtain the keys and open the portals.
