                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe in fighting injustice and oppression through technology. We saw a need for more effective organization among protesters and activists.  This app aims to help community leaders and participants communicate with each other efficiently in often chaotic situations. Security was another primary concern for us. Currently, Facebook is one of the primary avenues of organization, and information made public through it can be used against activists by police or others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main page of the app shows you a list of local events, which you can sort by various criteria such as distance or category. Each event has its own page with a real-time updating map, on which participants can add markers for points of interest such as water fountains, restrooms, roadblocks, and police. Each event page also has a forum for communication among participants.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Juan wrote the server code and  UI, and Caitlin wrote the Java and used the Esri ArcGIS SDK for the mapping aspect.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning to navigate the ArcGIS Android SDK was definitely a challenge and took up the better part of the first day or so.
                </p>

                    Sticking with it and working through the bugs!

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything is better when modular.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to have a polished prototype that we can share with beta testers within a few months.
