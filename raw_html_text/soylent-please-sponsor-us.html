                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are three rookies that wanted to create video games.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a minigame where the player controls a 2d rocket. The goal is to land on top Valley-H Planet, but only on top. If you tried to penetrate the planet from underneath, you would explode. Oh, one more thing, there are angry magnet birds on the way to Valley-H Planet, so watch out for those.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the game on Unity3d and C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a lot of difficulties generating borderless map since we only have one destination. Therefore we built teleport mechanism that created the illusion of infinitely wide map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the first working game that we ever built, so it was a huge step for all of us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each one of us learned a lot that we did not know before. Cumulatively we have learned: coding in C#, using libraries and tricks in Unity3D, and many photoshop techniques.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Soylent Express
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to finish the game, add in few more functionalities and skins (few ideas in mind), and hopefully publish it on some minigame platforms.
