                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The way kids play has changed over the years. As technology advances, kids are often faced with the same choice I was faced, to play games outside or to play video games inside. But there never seemed to be a choice to do a little bit of both at the same time. That  is where ConnectWear comes in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ConnectWear is a platform for kids to both play physical games while also implementing the exciting characteristics of video games. It consists of wearable electronics and add-on parts that can potentially be used to play several different types of games, ranging from tag to a twist on Mario Kart.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each wearable component consists of an NFR transmitter and Arduino Uno. The transmitters each have addresses, so each set can communicate with each other very specifically and with a large signal range. The first game we have implemented is tag, which utilizes pressure sensors for tagging and lights to indicate who is "it."
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making the devices wearable and robust was a great challenge, but was solved through much iteration and testing.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to have a working and wearable product that shows the concept we are going for and can be expanded.
                </p>

                    What's next for ConnectWear
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to keep working on this and create more game options and add-on for the platform.
