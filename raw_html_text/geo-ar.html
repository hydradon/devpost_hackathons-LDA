                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Walking through towns you don't know, there are many restaurants and they all look the same. There's no simple way to just walk around and easily get a quick description of the restaurant you're looking at
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using GPS, it figures out what restaurant you're looking at and fetches the name, opening hours, and reviews for it and overlays that information over your camera feed so you can read it while walking and not have to worry about walking into people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We took advantage of the Google Places API and mobile sensors to make a working website that does this
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team wanted it to be a website instead of a mobile app so it was easier to access. This added some complexity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Flask + google places API + how to access phone sensors + camera from a website
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Geo AR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the direction the phone is facing to improve accuracy of figuring out what restaurant you're facing. Improving UI. Adding information about price range of the restaurant. Making the information appear as if it in in the world (using AR) instead of just having it be an overlay.
