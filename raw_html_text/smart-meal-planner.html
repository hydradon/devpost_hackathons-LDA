                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Both being first year university students one thing that we have to do every week is plan our meals and make sure that we waste as little food as possible. We decided, what if there was an app that would help us do that?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is intended to help students (or anyone for that matter) waste less food by providing recommendations for what ingredients need using and when
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android studio in order to make the design of the app and java in order to program all of the classes we used to make it work
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to learn how fragments worked in Android-studio and worked with them for the first time
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project is very obviously unfinished but we plan to develop it further - we have set the ground work now the task is to realise our goals
