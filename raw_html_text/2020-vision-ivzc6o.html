                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As the new year just began, many people are trying to keep up with their New Year's Resolutions. We thought the best way to help people stay on track was to create an online planner. Planners are the best way to say on track and keep organized, so creating personalized and customizable planners is a step to achieving goals! With our planner, 2020 vision, people will be able to stay on top of academics and wellness goals instead of missing deadlines and procrastinating. New year, new me!

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our planner, called 2020 Vision (pun intended), is an online planner that is comprised of 3 sub-planners: Personal, Professional, and Household. You are able to log your days as you go, as well as view past submissions. 
Within the personal planner, you are able to log your mental wellness with categories such as mood tracker (scale of 1-5), water consumption, sleep tracker, exercise tracker, personal goals etc
Within the professional planner, you are able to log professional goals, upcoming events, view your calendar, and input your daily spend which will produce a graph to help you budget.
Within the household planner, you are able to keep a to-do list and keep track of your shopping list and chores.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using mainly HTML, we coded a website with allows you to access today's log or view the past. We worked together as a team, motivating and supporting each other to build our website.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we were all beginner hackers, it was difficult to get the ball rolling. We all attended workshops during the day to learn different techniques, and then regrouped and discussed. While we had many ideas we wanted to incorporate, we didn't have much experience or knowledge on the languages, so it was tough to design and implement exactly what we envisioned. We found ourselves being too ambitious, so in some areas we had to scale back the extravagance of our ideas. We were limited in what we could code, and hence we were limited in what we could do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As first time hackers, we are proud to have built a website from scratch! With perseverance and dedication, we were able to put together an idea and presentation deck, and execute it from start to end. We all feel like we have learned something new and greatly developed our skills, and feel ready to advance ourselves within the tech industry, even though none of us have a computer science background. Additionally, we are happy to have formed relationships with each other, and have networked with many other hackers and recruiters, and most importantly had lots of fun while doing it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Besides the coding we learned, we learned to be resilient. Throughout the night, there were many times where we felt like we were at a dead end or when we could't figure out what was going on with our code. But the most important thing was to try again and not be afraid to ask for help.
Also, we learned a lot about ourselves and what we want to do in the future, one of which is to participate in more hackathons!

                    What's next for 2020 Vision
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, we want to expand to a mobile app, be able to analyze the data and make recommendations, expand our product offering (by providing diaries and journals along with the planner), and be able to have a sharing feature, such that you can share with your family and friends.
