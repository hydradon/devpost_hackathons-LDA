                    Problem 1: Prevention
The fact that it could be as little as a few hundred dollars between home and homeless, certain communities within the homeless population have even greater challenges navigating shelters and prevention is hard

                <p>
                    Community members visit the site and either claim Need or Have. If Need, a user inputs details around their need for temporary housing, food or a job. If Have, the user searches for Needs, connects with a Need and the two users can exchange messages.
