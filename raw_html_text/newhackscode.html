                <p>
                    In my residence's dinning hall, there is a poster beside the door that says 58 percent of all food produced in Canada is wasted or lost. I was shocked when I first saw that. There are numerous causes for this waste, and one of the main ones is  families overestimating the amount food they can consume and buying too much when there is a sale, then throwing the surplus away because they cannot finish it on time. If we can help people to avoid doing that, then a great amount of resources will also be saved and we can lesson our environmental impact.
                </p>

                    What It Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This code is one portion of the application that will be implemented. The user inputs a fresh food item and its expected expiry date is retrieved from a database. This starts a timer until the item is expired. This serves two purposes: the user can keep track of the fresh food items they have bought and make sure to consume them before the expiry date, to reduce food wastage.
