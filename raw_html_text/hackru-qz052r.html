                    We came here as a group of three but one person gave up at midnight. 
We are all excited with the idea, but the programming is pretty hard since we need to learn many from scratch.
It should be an app uses nfc, but the guy in charge of that part left, so we knew it is not possible to finish it.
But we still tried after all.
I and my team mate learned a lot about programming for Android, since we have never done it before.
We also learned how to merge SQL into java code. 
We collaborated to figure out how to use Android studio but since the time is not enough We decided to upload whatever we got.
This is a good memory, not a competition. 
What we learned here in one day could take several months if took classes.
Definitely will come again.
