                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired to create this software because computer vision is intriguing and I wanted to explore the possibilities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application allows you to scan a vehicle license plate and retrieve user data of the driver. The use case is if two StateFarm customers have a collision, they can easily exchange information and notify their agents.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Unity3D with the Google Vision API for OCR and Vuforia SDK for displaying AR content.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating image markers at runtime to track was a difficult task due to limited capabilities of available SDKs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of the ease of use and accuracy the application has.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to implement Google Vision API for computer vision purposes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EasyReport
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding incident report generation with more detailed reporting features would improve the application.
