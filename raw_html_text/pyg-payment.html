                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our idea was inspired by a situation at a restaurant where a group of friends found it difficult to split the bill in a convenient way. What if there was some sort of application that did this for them? pygpayment is that app. It allows friends to easily pool money together to pay for things.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One can communicate and organise the financial side of a group event in the same app.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our approach was mostly based on trial and error. We played with the provided APIs and some technologies we didn't know.

"It'll be done in two days" become "Three" then "Never". Alas our dream will never be fufilled. This is mearly a tribute to what could have been truly a landmark in human acheivement.)
