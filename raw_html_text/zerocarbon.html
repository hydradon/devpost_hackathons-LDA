                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the ticking clock of global warming approaching the point of no return, saving the planet has become a personal duty now more than ever. We wanted to grant average citizens and businesses, who want to do their part, the tools that enable them to understand and control their carbon footprint.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app connects to an API that connects to different online calculators and enables users to regularly calculate their carbon footprint after entering some relevant attributes. The app then displays insights to the user or business in a dashboard to help them understand, compare and control their carbon footprint.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The data from different users is also aggregated and the tool can show you an overview of the carbon footprint in a specific area or region, where you can filter by type of business like restaurants, hotels, shops, or even museums.
With this application, public institutions and local governments can have a visual and measurable way to control their carbon emissions, how it is evolving, and the impact it is having on their city.
                </p>

                    <li>
                        We created the API to mock the carbon footprint calculations using TypeScript
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We created a scraper that indexed the main businesses in Berlin using Python to represent them on a map
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We created a Carto map to mock the geographic distribution of the carbon footprints in Berlin
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We created a Superset dashboard to display the insights and the map
