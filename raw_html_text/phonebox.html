                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Andrew has problems getting off reddit at night and actually doing what he needs in the morning, this hack solves both those by locking it away from him.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an alarm clock that also charges and keeps your phone away from you. it is designed to allow you 8 hours of phone free sleep at night.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    for our prototype we bough a cigar box and mounted an Arduino board to it. we then built a latching mechanism inside the box and hooked it up to some switches and a screen. you can set how long you want the phone locked away for using the controls and then used wifi clock in the cloud and can have accurate time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    finding the proper form factor, getting around the wifi at School, and working with the ESP8266 chip, which is a great chip, but had some compatibility issues.
                </p>

                    that Hackathons can be pretty fun time
