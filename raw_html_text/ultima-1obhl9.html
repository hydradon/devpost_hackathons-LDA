                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ultima is our a.i. companion, that while capable of doing allot of things, it has never been used for Healthcare and on a Robot. So we saw this as an opportunity to innovate and solve a 4.4 billion dollar problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We coded from scratch our A.I. in 24 hours!!!!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now it can diagnose someone who feels sick via speech and help them identify if they have a life threatening or a non-emergency problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the case of an emergency the assistant can call an emergency contact or first responders via voice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today the average cost of a hospital visit is around $1,200 dollars, only 11% of Emergency room visits result in hospital admission, and 65% of issues taking people to the ER are considered serious, even with these numbers ER visits have increased 27% making Healthcare less affordable and more inaccessible for all of us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Autonomous bot platform, it speaks with the user via TTS-STT and allows our A.I. to access a massive medically validated database that will allow a user to perform a high level diagnosis before making that call or driving to the ER.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In case of a serious Emergency using NEXMO Ultima can call automatically Emergency contacts or first responders, without the users interaction allowing the user to concentrate on what matters the most, their health!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Check the Stack Diagram!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hack-time and other technical difficulties had us pivot several times, eliminating Affectiva, and PubNub from the MVP.
Unfortunately we also had no time to implement our real-time emoji animation, built in ADOBE Animator
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works!!! It can really diagnose, and it's voice activated!!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    New Api's and how to finally put our A.I. in a robot!!;)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ultima
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This hack just made Ultima much more powerful and proved that the amount of use cases a AGI can be deployed in, is almost unlimited, so now we can go solve a 4.4 Billion problem for the Healthcare system.
