                    FREE CHICKEN
                </p>
                <p>
                    No but seriously we were all very interested in how to create a server for not only the front end of accessing information and images, but to have a server hold and save our data with multiple people having access to it.

                <p>
                    IDEA
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We wanted a website that not everyone could access, but everyone could understand and use, we wanted to have two different type of users, each with their own access. The higher up General manager could change the predicted sales and the price of the chicken at the time as well as access to create other users. The Ordering manager has less access to changing information, they can enter the amount of inventory in their store at the time and get how much they are needing to purchase. Nothing more.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a website application, that forces the user to login or not have access. This is because this website if for the use of the employees only, with out the server access, we do have two local accounts, one that has access to the information of the weeks sales and the price, and the other with just the current stock.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us really had any experience in web development, so we each took a part to learn and attempt to piece it all together, we used http to create the skelliton we used CSS to make it a little more pretty(this was not our main focus)
we used sql to create a server data base, and we used both php and java script to do the back end functions communicating with our servers and doing the math.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The server would not propperly connect and we never had access to the database. So we had to improvise and create it all without php and sql data base. but we were still able to get the idea of the website in a manageable prototype
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we created a website. Even with no expierence, we created a local server to host it. we created a data base that allowed access to read and write to it from our web application. and even when running into a HUGE issue we were able to create a working demo for our idea
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea and innovation is more important than the final product during a 24 hour marathon. 
We learned a lot of both the front and the back end programming when it comes to web development

                    Hopefully a lot of chicken 
and even more programming.
