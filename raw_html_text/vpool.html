                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently the government spends $600 million dollars on empty bus trips, we sought to help reduce
this waste of public money, through the incentive of saving money for the government but also to provide an even more competitive edge to the government with the rise rival company's such as UBER.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can request a mini bus from PTV from their app which sends a request to the nearest hub, which generates a path for the driver using an algorithm that processes multiple proximal user requests. Under sufficient demand, a mini bus will collect all nearby passengers back to the hub, otherwise it will wait a few moments until sufficient demand is met. Users will see this route on their app and an ETA, and upon arrival at the hub they will have access to other PTV transport services, whether it be trains or big buses. From there the client will change transport using PTV to arrive close to their location, whether another mini bus will drop them off to their location.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python/flask to set up a backend service.
Then used rethinkDB's GeoJSO to store coordinate systems.
The user end web app was created using HTML/CSS/JS with use of Google's map and Material Design API.
