                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    College frat parties and other social events are usually very unsafe; being able to 'check-in' can be a huge help to those going out alone or in small groups.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user can set their own name, location, time interval, and friend to contact to create a customized message to send if they don't respond or are unable to correctly answer questions. The program prompts a math problem after a time interval has elapsed, and if the user does not respond in 10 minutes or answers incorrectly 5 times, will send an email to the user's chosen contact to check up on them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using java's mail api, timer, and JFrame--and a lot of lines of code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sending emails, making a timer, and learning concepts about the JFrame GUI. As we are pretty new to both GUI, APIs, and java as a whole, the entire process was a great learning experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to send Emails through java, and mastering GUIs at least slightly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    APIs are extremely helpful for implementing creative features, coding as a group is difficult, GitHub makes no sense, and JFrame doesn't like change.
                </p>

                    What's next for PuzzlesforSafety
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully an Android and IOS version, as we decided to stick to just plain java this time to prove our concept.
