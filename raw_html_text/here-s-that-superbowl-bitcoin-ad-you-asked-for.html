                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So I just found out about this hackathon on May 29th, and the last 10 days, whoo...I tell you, I haven't slept much.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So yeah, bitcoin&rsquo;s awesome, and this hackathon was an amazing chance to try to learn new things and create something.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I saw the growth hack challenge, it seemed like the perfect job -make an art piece that is good for the whole bitcoin community, no advertising individual companies, or benefiting any one person...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Something made for the community, by the community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If I had more time, I could do better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this case done was the enemy of perfect. My voiceover could be way better, my tempo and timing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The audio, let&rsquo;s face it, I&rsquo;m not very skilled at audio production, in fact this was like my second or third time using the software, and last time was years ago.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So this is an area I could improve as well. In fact I&rsquo;d spend a whole month on this if I could.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love the altruistic concept of making art of the community and I thank Bitcoin Magazine and everyone who participated for this wonderful opportunity.

                    My wife asked me "what is fiat money?" and I wanted to point that out I put that part of the script in for just that reason, to make people question, and want to learn more. I reminded her of our conversations on how the dollar isn't backed by gold anymore, or anything more than the promises of politicians...so that is a reference to the House of Cards of Global Monetary Policy, money based on debt. Explaining the basic concepts of why bitcoin is so much better than fiat options is both wonderful, but also a responsibility to spread reliable information to those we come into contact with.

                    In the 10 days I had to: 
Come up with a concept 
Write the script 
Record the Voiceover 
Learn audio editing software to fix up the voiceover recording 
Animated every single frame of the video you see from scratch
                </p>
                <p>
                    I&rsquo;m just learning this software, so I had to do a ton of tutorials the whole time to learn how to actualize the vision I had. I composed the musical score in Sony Music Studio from sound samples (thank Bluezone Corporation for the sound architecture kits!)

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything was a challenge. I was learning as-I-go, so to achieve my vision, at each step, there was something I needed to learn. Then at 10PM Saturday evening I realized I lost (or never properly saved) the entire final scene, and had to do the whole thing over. In the end, now that the video is done and submitted, I can look back and say I think this was a good thing. It was super stressful in the moment it happened, but in retrospect, I definitely learned the process better and have a tiny bit more skill that I can build upon later. Mistakes happen, it's how you react. 26 hours to submit your project, you lose your ending...what do you do?

                    This was so much fun, and I'm proud to be able to pull this off in 10 days. (I did have to take off work on Friday to get this done tho...so thanks to my wife for suggesting that! Also she made sure I actually stopped working to eat, made me meals, and was a total angel to me during the past 10 days.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was proud to include all of Satoshi's equations from the White paper in the "backed by math" scene.

                    I have a whole series of videos I'd love to do, I've got a whole text file of subjects like;
USD vs. Bitcoin
Hodling vs. spending
Taproot &amp; Graftroot (plus schnoor signatures)
Bitcoin issuance schedule (I don't think  many people realize that within the next 10 years, the block reward decreases to under 1 bitcoin per block, and then for the next 140 years, the block reward reduces away from one to nothing per block, so scarcity is about to go thorough the roof within the next few halvenings.

                    plus a bunch of simple explainer-style videos to hep onboard the world (they're coming anyway, I'll just be acting as more of a herald of things to come...)
