                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all thought that it would be wonderful to work with Amazon Alexa, as it can interact with users purely by voice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program prompts users about their budget and interests, then Alexa gives suggestions as to where they can go on a road trip using additional knowledge from google's api's and some rankings from your interests.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our application in Node.js and JavaScript and utilized the Google Place and Map APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A major challenge we ran into was getting the Amazon Alexa API in Node.js to work. Luckily, we were able to consult the Amazon representative who was able to show us a highly effective strategy for writing Alexa commands.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud to have made a working, conversation-like program for the Amazon Alexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to gain a great deal of knowledge about Node.js and programming on the Alexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Road Trip
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are unsure as to what will happen to Road Trip in the future, but we think it will be extremely useful once voice command devices like Amazon Alexa become more common.
