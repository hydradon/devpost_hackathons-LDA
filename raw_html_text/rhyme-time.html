                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have two kids that are learning to rhyme at pre-school. They also seem to take to interacting with our Echo (which I've forced them to call "computer"). I wanted to build a game with Alexa that helped them learn to rhyme and learn some of the nursery rhymes that I grew up hearing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I originally built Rhyme Time two years ago, but then learned that Amazon was not yet allowing Skills for kids under 13... which is obviously who it was geared towards.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Kids can ask Rhyme Time to play a game. "Alexa, play Rhyme Time." Alexa will start a stanza from one of three Mother Goose Rhymes and then
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built Rhyme Time over the course of many, many evenings. I tested it repeatedly on my kids (and myself). It's all node.js. Zero ajax calls to external libraries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I think I went back and forth with the approval group about five times working on different bits. It's hard to think about all the different paths a user might go down in answering a prompt.

                    of documentation to read.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about poetry! At first I thought I could write an algorithm to find rhyming words, but I quickly realized that
                </p>
                <p>
                    (a) this is super hard
(b) kids like repetition and don't actually need that many different rhymes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also learned that Alexa can NOT recognize the difference between "fall" and "full" and "foal"
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I need to add a lot more rhymes!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm considering expanding it to Shakespeare and other poetry to help people learn them.
