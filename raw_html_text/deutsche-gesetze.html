                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I got an Alexa device as part of the perks program last November. However, I couldn&rsquo;t find that many skills that weren&rsquo;t &bdquo;just games&ldquo;, but actually useful. As a law student, I thought I could do my part by creating a useful skill aimed at lawyers, law students and people generally interested in the law.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My skill offers you a big range of laws. You can just ask for a specific norm and Alexa will read it to you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I saw that the Federal Ministry of Justice offers every German Law in an XML-Format (free to use). I converted more that 150 laws into a JSON format and filtered the relevant data. Then I coded a Js-Algorithm in the Alexa Developer Console, which is able to work with the data structure of the converted JSON-Files and which can fetch the law text which is needed for the spoken Response as well as a sent a card to the user&rsquo;s App.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A big challenge was the data structure of the converted JSON files, because they varied quite a bit and lead to errors. To solve that problem, I &bdquo;taught&ldquo; my algorithm to detect the kind of data structure of the specific law and then to fetch the content accordingly. This was really complicated, because I had to take a different approach for each deviant data structure. Furthermore, laws have different levels as each paragraph can be filtered into several parts (called &bdquo;Abs&auml;tze&ldquo;). Then there are many different ways of enumerations (eg. a-f or 1-9), which made the progress of creating a code which works every time even more complicated

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I&rsquo;m proud that I was able to solve the problems mentioned above. I created a code that was abstract and prepared for all kinds of different &bdquo;law formats&ldquo;. It felt good, that in the end I only had to add the laws without having to worry about the code itself. I learned coding just by watching a few Youtube videos and by trial and error. So I&rsquo;m really proud that I finished a skill all by myself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about coding and how big sets of data can be used in a creative way. I also learned how to tackle problems, that I though couldn&rsquo;t be solved.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Deutsche Gesetze
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First of all, it&rsquo;s important to keep every law up to date. Next steps could be creating similar skills for other countries or adding European legislative. However, not all countries offer they laws in a usable data-format.
