                <p>
                    Prox is a cryptographically secure location app that preserves privacy. Like most location apps, we show you friends that are close by. However, friends can't deduce each other's locations if they're not close by - and even the server doesn't know where you are!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The result is an iOS app that provides a useful service - telling you who's nearby - without compromising privacy. We use a modified version of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol to verify if you're close to a friend or not, without the server knowing where you are.
