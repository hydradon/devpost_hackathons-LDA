                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If you go to Walmart or any other huge supermarket , you tend to lose your footing and wander around finding stuff you intended to buy , looking at stuff you like and ending up wasting tons of time and buying stuff which you didnt even need in the first place. How you wish there was something which could tell exactly where what was.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes your shopping list and gives you exact aisle details of where your stuff is and what is the shortest path that you can take to grab em all. Also , it has huge amounts of number crunching on Azure so that the marketplace can benefit from the purchase data and the buying patterns of its users. It also gives a customizable store experience so that when you walk into Walmart , it knows via the use of beacons that it is a Walmart and not Target.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We simulated beacons to give the store ID and used Android to build the front end of the App. In the back-end , we looked up the aisle numbers using the store ID and the shopping list on the supermarket API. We simulated the beacons for payment terminal and posted the bill onto the app so that it can do some number crunching on Azure to give some insights for marketplaces.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didnt have beacons so we had to simulate it and the lack of enough time made it impossible to implement all the features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The machine learning and the data mining part hosted on Azure.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Different members learnt different new technologies and we learnt how to work efficiently during difficult times where you haven't slept in days! :p

                    What's next for Shoptimizer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing the next set of features which we couldn't complete because of time such as giving out the payment info through beacons and seperate login for marketplaces.
