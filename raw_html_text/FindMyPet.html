                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting a pet is one of life&rsquo;s most enjoyable moments. But one thing that nobody tells you when you first get a pet is that dreadful feeling you have when they almost escape. But that feeling doesn&rsquo;t even hold a candle to the fear and horror that forms when you actually lose your pet. In the USA alone, around 68% of households have pets. That&rsquo;s about 85 million families. Just imagine how many lost pets that&rsquo;s equivalent to. Yes, while there are microchips and GPS locators, but they don&rsquo;t account for retrieving your pet, only for finding them. For example, PawBoost dot com helps people find their pets, but gives them no options for making sure the pet doesn&rsquo;t run away again when approached.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a forum on the main screen with information and pictures of lost pets in your community, as well as their owner's voice recording, calling them. The pets are more likely to respond to their owner's voice than a stranger, so it is easier to retrieve the pet, rather than just find it. There is also a profile screen with your contact information, which gets sent out along with information about the pet if it goes missing. You can easily modify the information if you need to. The last page is an emergency page that will send out your pet's information along with your contact info when it goes missing. You can input what the pet likes to eat, making it easier to lure the pet. Finally, there is a button to activate a LED collar that we built to let people know that the pet is lost, and also to protect it at night on the streets.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to build this app. We designed it on paper first, then added one screen at a time and developed them slowly.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were unable to create a database in the short time, so we had to input sample data. However, we hope to input a database in the future.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the first time we have ever coded an app and implemented it. We are all first-time hackers, and we worked very well as a team

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about teamwork, project management, and how to get creative when programming. We found many solutions by try and error, but in the end we learned that we can do a lot more than we believed at first.

                    What's next for FindMyPet
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to make this an actual app on Google Play. We hope to help pet owners keep their peace of mind, and pets stay safe. We hope to add a database to this application, as well as make the code more scaleable.
