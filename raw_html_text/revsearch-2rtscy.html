                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finder is awful, so we wanted to fix it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Access, create, delete, etc with files on your computer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made it with Python and the built in terminal commands on MacOS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The commands weren't working as we wanted them to, and folders with spaces were hard to identify.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made the project in under 320 lines and that the project could end up replacing Finder on Mac.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the commands on the terminal and we learned a lot about the Popen object on Python.
                </p>
