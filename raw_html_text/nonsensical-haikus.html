                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for this project came from how we often we are bored and stressed. We wanted to find a way to relieve this stress and have a good time, so we made the Nonsensical Haiku generator.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Haiku generator randomly picks nouns and verbs from a list of thousands of words and puts them together to form a Haiku with a 5-7-5 syllable form. This Haiku Generator helps people read relaxing/silly poetry and expand their vocabulary.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it by first creating 8 different lists of nouns and verbs categorized by the number of syllables. Then, we wrote a generator to randomly pick words from these 8 lists, alternating between noun and verb, and fulfilling the 5-7-5 syllable form of a Haiku. We then implemented it into a JFrame so that it would run like an app and have an option to generate another one. This was to create a more friendly user interface.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One challenge we ran into was getting JFrame to work because we had never used it before. Another challenge was collaborating with teammates because it was difficult to keep track of what teammates were doing while completing your own tasks.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of making something at a hackthon for the first time as well as learning and using Java skills along the way.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use JFrame and Event Handlers through creating this Haiku generator, which is something we had never done before.
                </p>

                    What's next for Nonsensical Haikus
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to improve Nonsensical Haikus so that it will include less obscure vocabulary and possibly make more sense.
