                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the difficulties that the visually impaired faced, I developed a tool to help them understand what they see.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website takes an image url and tells the user keywords to help the user understand the image.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using Python, HTML and CSS and used the clarifai API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Original idea did not end up working out and started working on this late in the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned and coded in python for the first time. Learned to use the flask and gained a better understanding of HTML structure and POST and GET methods.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned python, flask, how to use vim and terminal, learned about the structure of HTML and websites and how to use POST and GET methods.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EyeHelper
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next for EyeHelper is capability for keywords to be read aloud to the user within the app. Future capabilities also will include braille reading capabilities by building a braille clarifai library so that clarifai can learn different words in braille as most people that are blind cannot read braille.
