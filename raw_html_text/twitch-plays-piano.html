                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were excited to utilize a piano keyboard as hardware and we wanted to interface with Twitch.tv in some fashion. We were also heavily influenced by the success of the Twitch Plays Pok&eacute;mon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can control aspects of a piano, such as the pitch of the notes, their duration, rests, intensity, and tempo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We accessed Twitch chat using a python IRC client. We parsed the text we received from the chat into notes, duration, and intensity. We then passed those aspects of the music to a Java program which played the music on the piano via MIDI signals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could only write one note to the piano at a time which prevented us implementing chords.
                </p>
