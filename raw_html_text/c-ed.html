                    As kids, we used to play a lot of farming games and because of this, we were inspired to create our own farming game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the game, the player must plant seeds and harvest crops and sell them for a profit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We build the game using our knowledge of python, PyGame, photoshop, and GitHub. We also used a lot of teamwork
and split up into different roles to tackle all aspects of our program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We ran into problems with making our work compatible with each other, mostly with the isometric graphics clashing with PyGame's usual system. We were also distracted by all the other great events and workshops at MasseyHacks2, and that took a lot of our interest away from the program and more towards these other elements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of our graphics and code, especially with our usage of classes, something that we have all tried to become more proficient in for Python. We are also proud of how well we worked together. However, we are not too proud of the end result as of yet but are planning to work together to make it just a start to what we believe will be a great game in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about isometric pixel art and how it works with coding and math, even though it did give us some problems in the end. we also as mentioned above learned a lot about classes in Python. We also learned about some of the limits of python and PyGame and how much it can handle in terms of fps and memory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the future, we plan on keeping our group together, and continue woking on C'ed, and accomplishing our dream.
