                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this project came from our enthusiasm for the health sector. We long realized that the sharing of patient information has been limited by its location. Patients receiving care in one facility would not have the information about their care available in other facilities. This lack of accessibility for patient information often leads to misdiagnosis and mistreatment. Not only this, this greatly hinders clinical research times as data access must be granted for multiple facilities given a single patient. In comes Patient Chain, by leveraging block chain, we are able to create common access point for all patient data across all facilities. Allowing for every healthcare provider to have access to the same information, thus solving our data sharing problem.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Patient Chain takes Ethereum (form of block-chain) to serve all the data for a patient on the block that allows the patient to view their medical history whenever they wanted. It will also also the doctors to use their Doctor ID with the patient's ID to view their medical records for improved diagnoses, less wait time, more ethical treatment and most of all - credible and accountable information for doctor's to use.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to use ReactJS as our front end and created our smart contracts in Solidity as our backend. The smart contract acted as a traditional back end in this project and handled the getting and setting of data.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us really understood or even knew what block-chain was coming into this hackathon. This lack of an understanding was difficult at first as we had to first be caught up on the specifics behind it. Development was also slow as we had to familiarize ourselves with a new language and programming style.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to learn what block-chain is, how it works, and how we can code it, all in 36 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to leverage block-chain to solve a real life issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Patient Chain
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We truly believe that Patient Chain will be hugely beneficial to the health sector in terms of providing quality patient treatments and faster research. Thus, we could leverage this technology not only to doctors, pharmacists and other professionals - this technology would allow research to be more credible and perform faster as they would have all the relevant information needed
