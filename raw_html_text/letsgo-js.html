                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have run into a handful of situations where we just simply wanted to add some nice CSS transitions. Unfortunately, regular HTML seems to be deprived of this, so we aimed to remedy this problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    letsGo makes it really easy for static websites to feel not-so-static. It's for people who've never used Javascript or just want a lightweight solution to animate things on their websites without the need for custom Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our goal was just to make it as user friendly as possible. We spent almost an entire day re-working the the commands needed to use letsGo just becauses it made them slightly easier to use. We we're
                    <em>
                        very
                    </em>
                    conscious of our audience throughout the entire process. This means we put more weight on things like ease-of-use and less weight on things like fancy new features and pre-packaged examples - which could be an endless rabbit-hole.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had beginner hackers and non-web hackers try letsGo and we learned that letsGo.js, at first, wasn't as simple as we thought it was. So we spent a ton of time simplifying it even further!!!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for letsGo.js
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we built letsGo.js for us originally
                    <em>
                        and then
                    </em>
                    decided to make it OS, the development will not stop. Plus Isabelle and Angie, our wonderful hacker twins are going to help contribute to the project in the future as well so they don't stop learning either.
