                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    USDA database we pulled our data from was only about 230,000 which was not as comprehensive as we would have hoped for and limited the amount of items our bar code scanning would find.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Everything we were able to finish since this was all of our first time making an Android app and using Kotlin.
