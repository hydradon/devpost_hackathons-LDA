                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we began to think about ideas for our hackathon project, we decided to look into our everyday problems to try and create a tool that would help make ours and our peers' lives easier. The immediate thought that came to mind was our struggles with workload and time management. Sudeep and I go to a competitive high school, Monta Vista High, where time management is crucial to success. We decided that by creating such an utility, we would be able to help ourselves and others over a long period of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web app provides the user with different activity categories, shown via buttons. The user is instructed to click an activity button to input workload relating to that particular activity. More buttons may be included further along to define subcategories, and at the end the user can enter his tasks for the week. The list of tasks displays and is available for the user to reference and accordingly plan out his/her time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML/javascript to build the app. Different html files were used for different pages of the web app, and we utilized a variety of tools such as images, buttons and text boxes to enhance user experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some difficulties in time management as we both spent lots of time on errors that took a long time to be solved. Also, one of our teammates was feeling exhausted by sleep deprivation, so he was unable to work for a while. However, as a team we still brought in our energy towards the end to end the hackathon on a good note.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of new coding skills regarding HTML that we've acquired over the past 24 hours. Also we're proud of our calmness and enthusiasm to learn and gain the experience rather than win.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had prior knowledge of coding, but we also learned a great deal today. We researched various tools to implement in our coding and acquired new skills with implementing them to created desired effects. Also, we learned a great deal about communication. We became better listeners and teachers to each other as we attempted to help each other to create a good web app and an even better experience.

                    We want to improve the UI/UX design, but we also want to add new, cool features such as productivity graphs, estimations of time workload, and implementation of machine learning to enhance user experience. We want to work on thi
