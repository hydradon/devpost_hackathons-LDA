                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The entire team either works in healthcare or has family members that work in healthcare. Coming up with solutions that improve the system on global, decentralized smart contracts gets us really excited.

                <p>
                    Doctors incentivize patients by waiving their copay to upload their most up to date health records. myHEALTH stores data on distributed storage and with healthcare providers. Providers and patients lower insurance costs and premiums by being able to prove medical history on the blockchain.
