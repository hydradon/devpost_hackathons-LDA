                    Roboteyes is a blind persons personal assistant. It runs as a bot in Facebook Messenger and Slack and helps blind people experience their surroundings in a more independent way.
Inspired by Be my Eyes the user can send a photo to Roboteyes and can ask questions about it afterwards. This ranges from general questions about what has been captured over questions surrounding color recognition up to label and text detection to find certain objects the user is looking for easily.
