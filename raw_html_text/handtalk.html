                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by our ASL group and a humbling incident in which a few of our group members could not effectively communicate with primary users of ASL because of the lack of knowledge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What we do is use hand motion that get converted into letters, characters, spaces, backspace and then words are saved into a text file. This text file is then passed to our app which displays the text and should essentially speak the text.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a leap motion sensor, programmed using C# on Unity and the app was created on Android studios
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HANDTalk
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have future ideas to make this more useful including speech to hand signs, implemetation of UI and easier functionality
