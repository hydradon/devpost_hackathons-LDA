                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first wanted to make tank that runs inside of the sphere, but we thought it would be still cool to make a tank that runs on the ground.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It stimulates the buletts shot from the tank and destroys the other balls, or enemy. If you hit the enemy, you die.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shota built the background algorithm and Nico built the stage and menu.
