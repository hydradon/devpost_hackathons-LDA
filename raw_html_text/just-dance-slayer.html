                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game "Just Dance"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are using computer vision to teach people how to dance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was built using Python, OpenCV and OpenPose (pose estimation framework developed by CMU). We are taking a user's webcam feed and comparing it to a dance video, calculating the similarity between the two and then outputting a score that the user can see and keep track of
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not have enough GPU power to run our app at a "playable" frame rate. As a result, we cannot demo our app. We were also trying to get use the AWS credits for GPU computing but nobody would help us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to put everything together and have our project work on a desktop computer with a powerful GPU
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bring and external GPU to the next hackathon or get our hands on cloud computing resources beforehand if we want to work on ML/CV intensive tasks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Just Dance Slayer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will continue to develop it and try to make the application less GPU intensive so more people can use it (maybe use another pose estimation framework)
