                    The Inspiration for this project was a heavily modified version of sonar battle from

                    , we planned some changes and wanted to make a multiplayer game like many of the ".io" that are currently out there on the internet.

                    Our program procedurally generates a height a map in which the user can navigate the open seas, to survive in the harsh world of enemies which carefully aim and fire missiles at your submarine, which will get destroyed if you upon or beach it. #nobodyLikesABeachedWhale

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Are game is built using Javascript with use from the p5.js SDK

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We couldn't seem to get any web-based set up to work, so we decided based on the time limit and the number of team members to just make the game single player game against the computer. Unfortunately, we also ran into very serious collision detection problems which required an entire rewrite of the code and approximately 12 hours later, the collision detection was up and running.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    Getting the collision detection up and running and not giving up, despite numerous setbacks. Also, we managed to create a field of enemies that seek out your position in land and sea, making the game particularly challenging.
