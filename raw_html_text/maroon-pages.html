                    We wanted to find a way to find events around campus in the most efficient and helpful ways for students. Often times we feel that these events are advertised all over the place and it&rsquo;s hard to keep track of them, but this website not only puts all of them together, but it also filters it for the user, allowing more reach for organizations while also helping the user!
