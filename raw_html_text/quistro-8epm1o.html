                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're trying to create an application that helps people. We focused on an easy to use design and concept. We wanted to create something that would be used everyday and could solve a problem in everyday life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app eliminates the problem of choosing what place to go eat at. The most difficult part of going out to eat is finding the place to go. People are naturally indecisive; our app narrows down your choice based on your location and distance willing to travel before giving a single recommendation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We sat down as a team and brainstormed ideas. After a few minutes, one of our team members recommended an Android app since that is where our skills could be best used. We split the project into three parts; a front-end portion, a design portion, and a back-end development team. After delegating roles, we dove into our respective tasks. We used Android Studio as well as the Yelp API to find restaurants based on location, distance, and provide information such as rating, cost, contact information, and address.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most challenges that our team faced were posed by us being new to Android Studio, since two of us never used Android Studios before. We had a lot of problems with requesting information from the Yelp API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team was assembled on the first day of the hackathon; we had no idea who one another were before the start of the project. As the hackathon progressed, we got to know each other as friends and we got better at working with and understanding each other. We were able to create something amazing while learning a lot of new things.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to communicate with one another effectively, both orally and through github. Half of our team had no idea how to use android studio at the beginning of the hackathon. By the time the hackathon completed, all of our team was proficient in android mobile development. We also dealt with APIs we had never used before, which posed problems early on and forced us to adapt and learn.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Quistro
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are a lot of directions that Quistro can follow. We're focused on building a food app that helps people find a place to eat. Although it is a simple idea, there are many bells and whistles that can be added to the project to make it more user-friendly, such as preferences and saving the top picks for the future so we can better recommend places.
