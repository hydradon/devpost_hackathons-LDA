                <p>
                    The vast majority of college students are living on a very tight budget, and they do not even know how to properly manage the small amounts of money they have. We wanted to create something that would help students make sure that they don't starve for the week, or ever.

                <h2>

                <p>
                    Asks student how much they make and want to save, while also making recommendations for how much that should be. Keeps track of their bank account and their total spending to determine if they are meeting their budget goals. We also set up a projection for how much money per week it would take to save a desired amount of money in a year given a student's current budget.
