                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being university students, we understand the struggle that comes with the transition of going to first year. We decided to create a project that would help new incoming freshman.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use either a web-app or iOS app that allows a user (or broker) to fill in personal and travel information, choose the universities of their interest and then provide an elegant routing path that is optimized.

                        Difficulties coming up with an idea; overcame by spending a long time trying to find a problem that was worth solving and could actually provide some type of value to the user

                    <li>
                        Inexperience with technologies; overcame by intensively reading documentation, understanding the logic, and basically two all-nighters to get tasks done

                        The most important part of development is persistence and supporting each other to ensure that everyone can complete their tasks and contribute to the overall project.
