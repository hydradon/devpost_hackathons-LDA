                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tetris T-span back into all our hearts as it rose to popularity once again in the recent past, in no small part due to Tetris 99 - a battle royale Tetris game on the Nintendo Switch. As such, we were inspired to create our own version of one of the best selling games of all time.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tetris Tension is a two-player co-operative puzzle game. It is similar to Tetris, however there is a big twist: one player has the controls for the Tetris pieces on the board (but doesn't see the board) while the other player can only see the board itself, with no ability to change it. The aim is for the two players to work together to achieve a new high score!

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout out development process we encountered many challenges spreading across both our front and back end code. In terms of front end, we originally began using React JS to implement Tetris however it became apart halfway through this was no an effective route forward. It's because this we had improvise and adapted our origin code and functions into JavaScript - aka react
                    <em>
                        BOO
                    </em>
                    &gt;: (. For our back end we encountered many problems involving connecting sockets, but after many trail and errors, the use of random text files and sheer will power it works almost every time (apart from in Firefox but who has that anyway).

                    -Not falling asleep
-Eating pretty much only chocolate for the past 24 hours 
-Configuring the Wii Plaza music to play automatically throughout the use of our application (to spice up game play and build tension
