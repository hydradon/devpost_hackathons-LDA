                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A Convolutional neural net based Ai driver that can drive a car for any game. (Tested on GTA 5, Project Cars, Asseto Corsa)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It just drives... and learns while it drives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used python for the input output and tensorflow for the Neural net. The AI also has an Open CV mode to help generate training data
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not being able to generate enough test data. I originally wanted 1 to 2 million frames of training data but was only able to generate ~50,000. So it is pretty stupid at the moment.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fact that it works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot about machine learning and python.
                </p>

                    He just goes where the wind blows.
