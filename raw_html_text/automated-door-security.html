                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    University buildings require card swipe access and 20$ for lost card replacement. 
Nextfab, a maker's studio, also requires RFID card access and 25$ for lost card replacement, I usually arrive to this place with a bulk of stuff in my hands and do not want to go through the hassle of trying to find my card.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The door will be open by entering the password on an android app. If the owner forget to close the door, the door will automatically close itself within 10 seconds. Alternatively, the owner can also close the door with the option "Close door" in the app.
Additionally, the security features ensure that any stranger outside the 0.5 mile- radius cannot open/close the door even with access to the app and the password.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it through serial communication through Arduino and MATLAB. The Arduino focuses on rotating the servo and detecting the input. MATLAB on the other hand detects changes in the server of a given device. There is an Android App associated to it. The app is responsible for locking and unlocking the door by sending commands.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the team members started learning some hardware programming, so there were a lot of education made. The servo wasn't behaving as expected, so had to run test to see how it functions
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Completed the prototype of the project, one of the members learned new things about the Arduino and serial communication., the other member learned to teach some programming to someone new.
