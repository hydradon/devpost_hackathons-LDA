                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to share pictures anonymously with people but we're too lazy to go through the effort of tagging the picture as is common practice in this day and age. So if an app could do that for us it would be a load off our minds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows users to upload an image which is automatically tagged using the Clarifai API. You can also search for pictures which correspond to the most popular tags among all users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Split the main screen, camera functionality and server functionality into three separate applications and then joined them together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Git problems, AWS problems, Firebase problems, lack of sleep problems, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to get a lot of these problems built and solved from the ground up
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use a third party API and database services
                </p>

                    What's next for LazyTag
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we aren't too lazy, we'll try to squash a bunch of bugs, add voting and search functions
                </p>
