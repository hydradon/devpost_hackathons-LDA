                <p>
                    Attacked by severe cold, I was unable to get out of bed and made my way to Political Economy class, one of my favorite lecture courses. My absence on that day was even worsened by the fact that an amazing guest speaker was giving the class a lecture on what school don&rsquo;t teach you about the business world, a topic that had long captured my attention since I first saw it. Even though asking a friend to record the whole speech for me would be a valid solution to the problem I was facing, it would be better if I could control a recording device remotely through voice command only, considering my health status. What&rsquo;s more, if the recorded audio file could be automatically transcribed into text file or even summarized into an outline with a few sentences only, my compromised logical thinking ability under severe cold would be greatly assisted when I tried to understand the speech.
