                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I turned 21 this year and I have learned an abundance of drinking games. I tend to have a hard time remembering them all though so I started writing the instructions to them out for reference. I started thinking wouldn't it be nice to have a super simple website that simple provides the names and instructions for the games.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My website is a simple but snarky interface for people to choose either card or cup drinking games, then they can choose a game and view the instructions. If they choose that they do not wish to drink they website provides a snarky response (this is chosen randomly from a set).

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using html, and a server my school club has.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am a Mechanical Engineering student and the only programming I know is a small amount of MATLAB. I came to this hack-a-thon to spend some time with my computer science friends and to enjoy the adventure. I didn't want to waste my time here to I learned some html using the internet and my friends for help. So the biggest challenge was having an idea but not knowing how to code.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to create a website (simple as it may be) that works and does what I wanted it to. I was also able to learn enough html to do this in a limited amount of time.
                </p>

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    I learned some html code.

                <p>
                    I hope to maintain and continually improve my website as I learn more code and more games.
