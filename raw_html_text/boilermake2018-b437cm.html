                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We saw a really nice website and wanted to address the debate over pets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After you ask a couple of general questions and help us get to know you slightly better, we provide the best recommendation on what pet you should get

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we designed a beautiful static web page with HTML5 and CSS3. We simply used JavaScript for our quiz logic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since this was a first project for most of us, we had a hard time figuring out how to set up interactive Backend and front end suitably. We ran into a lot of logic errors and we tried to incorporate some aspects that ended up becoming completely unresponsive and unusable. We struggled a lot with working on the UI and getting the web page to display properly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create a considerably good application with some cool UI as our first project using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The web page looks very nice and works relatively well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about development of web browsers and how to incorporate different aspects into a nice web page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Purfect Pet
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wish to incorporate an API to improve upon the quiz and make it more diverse and complex. We would also like to get some of the aspects that we had to remove, incorporated.
