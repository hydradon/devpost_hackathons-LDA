                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On TA bonding nights we spend hours playing Betrayal of the House on the Hill. However, the game takes a long time to play and it requires many people to play. We wanted to create a similar game that allowed users to play it in an efficient time and alone!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows users to go through a haunting story game. They can move around a randomly generated house, collect items from rooms, and respond to events occurring in the hallways. All in all, users collect clues to try and piece together a haunting murder.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used java as the coding language and coded the app using Android Studio. We shared a github repository so everyone could be on the same page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we had was creating a randomly generated house. The house can be of any size, with rooms anywhere in the house and hallways connecting the rooms. The difficulty was ensuring that hallways would connect to rooms properly, allowing users to traverse through the house.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are most proud of having a working app. If we had more time we would fix the story plot, but all in all the functionality is correct and allows for future development. None of us had taken on a similar project to this before, so it was empowering knowing we can do this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that we need to focus earlier in the day if we do not want to be staying up late. We also learned the basics of github as we came into many problems trying to merge properly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for hauntwist
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to further develop the storyline. Currently the story line has little depth and a few plot holes. It would be nice to really be able to have an interesting story along with the game.
