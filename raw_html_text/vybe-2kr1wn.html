                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the challenges surrounding mental health that are taken on by university students every day!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app "Vybe" is designed to be a tool that encourages socials interaction and free speech for students suffering from mental illness. By allowing anonymity, we give these people a chance to speak freely to one another about their struggles, in the hopes that these individuals will provide support for one another. The app also features a progression system (through levels) and an in-app currency that will encourage users to stay active and start working on bettering themselves!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application was designed in Unity. Our group designed many different "screens" that the user could interact with when using the app, every group member would pick a screen they want to work on, then at the end we connected them all to make a cohesive experience.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The two primary challenges our team ran into were the time constraint and learning new technology. The challenge that takes the forefront here is that only of of our team members knew how to use Unity before the hackathon, so we had to spend a lot of our time learning the ins and outs of the program. This coupled with the small time-frame lead to a prototype that could definitely be improved upon.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of what we were able to accomplish in this short time frame. Even through running 12 hours non-stop with lack of sleep, we were able to come up with an incredible idea and make a feasible demo and a great pitch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use Unity, how to code in C# and how to pitch effectively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Vybe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Short term, we are looking to fully develop the app. Once we've gotten our desired product, we look to try to spread the app throughout campus. Long term, we hope that Vybe will spread across North America, and maybe even the world!
