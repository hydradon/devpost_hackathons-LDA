                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All throughout our lives, we see countless students struggling with the trials that come with having dyslexia. Academics have developed new fonts which are able to minimize the difficulty these students have with reading. Inspite of that, we don't see these being used in schools and colleges. We wanted to build something that can render formatted text in real time to aid these students.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes as input real time video stream, identifies text using OCR, converts text into the desired font and overlays this format text on the screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We send image frames to a python server that we run locally. This server send these frames to google cloud. We use the google cloud vision API to perform OCR and extract text. This text is formatted and overlayed on screen.
                </p>
