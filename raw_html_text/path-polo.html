                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After meeting a fellow first year student who had difficulty finding his classes due to visual impairments, we were inspired to create an app that could fix that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Path Polo helps guide the user to their destination through vibrations. The user inputs their destination using keyboard input or dictation and a series of vibrations will start, which indicate to the user their location relative to the destination. As the user moves closer to the destination, the frequency of the vibrations will increase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app was built using Android Studio, and integrating Google Maps API along with Google Geocoding API. We also used GitHub for collaboration and version control.
