                    The most recent publication provided by
                    <strong>
                        Statistics Canada
                    </strong>
                    outlines a problem with
                    <strong>
                        high
school dropout rate
                    </strong>
                    . In
                    <strong>
                        2010
                    </strong>
                    , the
                    <strong>
                        high school dropout rate
                    </strong>
                    was
                    <strong>
                        8.5%
                    </strong>
                    . For those living
outside big cities the dropout rate was much larger
                    <strong>
                        (15.5% to 17.9%)
                    </strong>
                    . There is also
much more
                    <strong>
                        young men dropping out (10.3%)
                    </strong>
                    than women (6.6%). Although the dropout
rate has decreased steadily since the 1990s, the decrease rate has slowed in recent years. Among those that do graduate, some choose not to pursue post-secondary education
prime reason being
                    <strong>
                        insufficient knowledge
                    </strong>
                    of university/college programs and preparation.
Students
                    <strong>
                        interviewed
                    </strong>
                    by the Colleges of Ontario
                    <em>
                        said that it would have helped if current
college students visited to provide personalized information
                    </em>
                    . For those who enroll in
college/university, there is a high likelihood that they change their major. In the North
America,
                    <strong>
                        80% of students change their program at least once
                    </strong>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Evidently, students can greatly benefit by having a vast amount of information at their
disposal during high school so that there is more certainty in what they want to pursue
as a career.
                    <strong>
                        If students are better equipped with knowledge on career choices, they can
make a more informed decision
                    </strong>
                    . Students make their decision based on criteria such as:
                    <em>
                        future employment opportunities, personal interest, reputation of program, reputation
of institution and proximity to home
                    </em>
                    . Hence, this information can be provided to
the student to supplement their decision making process. Choosing the right major is
extremely important because it affects the student&rsquo;s engagement, retention, student life,
goal setting and more .
