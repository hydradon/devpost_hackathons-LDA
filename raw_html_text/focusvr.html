                <p>
                    Distractions are all around us. We all have our spaces to study, to create, to relax, and to experience in. Sometimes those places are inaccessible, but with Virtual Reality, we want to change that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By combining Cognitive Science research on Attention, Memory, and State Dependent Learning, we designed a system that teleports you into an immersive, minimal, and distraction free environment wherever you physically are.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In State Dependent Learning, Encoding Variability of environments is key to being able to perform at an optimal level in any environment.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to our revolutionary design, we had to pioneer a way to combine two PC's with two Leap Motion trackers into a single Unity VR Experience.
Ergonomic Designs to the Environmental UI required a lot of tinkering around to get just right. Experimenting with spatial audio cues for prompts is relatively unknown of.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We nailed the 3D Writing/Drawing tool (something that hasn't been done before)
Countless hours were spent ensuring on User Experience by having comfortable environment transitions

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Designing 360&deg; 3D environments requires a different way to thinking about User Interfaces, Interactions, and Input Methods.
Organize team tasks in an Agile manner to ensure maximum productivity across the board.
