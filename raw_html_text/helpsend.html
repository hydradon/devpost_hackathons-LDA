                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team member Ri Sheng is a member of the NUS Computing Club Community Service Cell. During one of the events organized by the cell, he realized that there was a huge proportion of underprivileged families in Singapore. During our brainstorming phase, we initially wanted to target elderly who needed help with tasks such as replacing of light bulbs. However, we eventually narrowed the scope down to underprivileged children who cannot afford tuition as we believe it will have a bigger social impact.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is a platform for volunteer tutors to connect with children who needs extra help with their assignments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team has had no experience creating a Android app prior to this hackathon. Therefore we struggled to apply any of the SmartNation's APIs. And we were limited by our ability to only include a few functions in our application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From never using Android Studio before to creating an functional application is something we are really proud of. Our team managed to also implement the Google Maps API to convert a String to a location pin on the app, as well as show the current location of the User on the map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've learned to store data in an SQLite database, displaying it in a ListView and implement a Google Maps API.
                </p>

                    What's next for HelpSend

                <p>
                    We would love to include the following functions in future:

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Chatroom function to add an additional layer of safety for our users
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Display nearby TuitionRequests to the Tutor's current location
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Create user authentication using NDI's MyInfo API or other forms
