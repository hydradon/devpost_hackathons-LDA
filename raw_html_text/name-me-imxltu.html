                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a project that lets you know who are the people around you by using the Microsoft HoloLens. We thought this project would be a good idea for many reasons. A lot of people forget names or wish they could know the name of someone they saw. Name.me is now a game changer in the life of everyone who's going to use it because it's literally making this possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By walking anywhere you want you get to know the name of the people you meet, powered by Microsoft Cognition Face Recognition. Implemented on the new Microsoft HoloLens, this application lets you do something pretty amazing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program was built using C#, Visual Studio, Unity and Microsoft Azure. We also used the Universal Windows Platform for testing purposes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The installation of the different components was sort of the first challenge we met. Since a really new platform, Microsoft HoloLens requires a state-of-the-art operating system and computer, which we had the chance to get ourselves. In terms of the development, the challenges were mostly around the use of Microsoft Azure, necessitating to be well configured. If not, the development of our idea was a challenge in general.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of what we have been able to make, which was not easy and required a lot of perseverance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Unity, Microsoft HoloLens Development, Microsoft Azure, and many things about problem solving, as always.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Name.me
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, we plan continue developing the idea and the product on an emulator we've already configured and many release the result of our work in the HoloLens Windows App Store to the general public.
