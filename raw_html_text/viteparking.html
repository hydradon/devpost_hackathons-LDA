                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Frequent drivers know the frustration of parking. In metropolises such as downtown Vancouver, traffic and parking dissatisfaction is much more pronounced. To ease workers&rsquo; commute experience, VileParking aims to replace the still-abundant coin meters and improve open parking searches in Vancouver and other metropolises by automating parking searches and payments. VileParking will also future-proof city infrastructure by collaborating with governments to enable the seamless integration of autonomous vehicles and IoT into the city&rsquo;s roads.

                    The core features comprise a real-time license plate detection system and a mobile application to interface with users.
Camera detects the presence of a car
Camera obtains the license plate number
Camera records the parking duration once the car has left
Camera transfers the license plate number and parking duration to the ViteParking mobile app
ViteParking finds the car owner using the license plate number in a cloud database and their corresponding banking details
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figma was used to design the front-end mobile app UI, which was then converted to CSS code.
Google Vision API is used to identify and label the presence of a car before using Google OCR to capture the license plate number. MongoDB is used to store user details, banking information, and license plate number. ViteParking communicates the license plate number and parking duration for charging the appropriate amount to the associated user&rsquo;s balance based on the parking spot&rsquo;s pricing.
