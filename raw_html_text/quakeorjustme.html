                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Design is inspired mainly by kahoot. Simple white against color design with darker accents for a 3d/raised effect.
Main idea inspired by me waking up at 2am wondering if that tremble I felt was my imagination or an actual earthquake that just struck.

                <p>
                    Tells users whether or not an earthquake recent occured in the user's vicinity.
If there is one, it lists local fire and police department non-emergency numbers.
If there isn't one, give the user some words of encouragement!!!!!!!

                    Using MaxMind GeoIP2's City Database, I fetched the visitor's city's approximate LatLong coordinates.
Using the USGS Realtime GeoJSON API, I fetched recent earthquakes with a magnitude of &gt;2.5 and put them in my database.
To see whether or not there was an earthquake found in their vicinity, I would query the database for a range of LatLong values that would be in proximity (30mi) to the user.
To find the fire department phone numbers, I had to import a CSV file containing every fire department in the
