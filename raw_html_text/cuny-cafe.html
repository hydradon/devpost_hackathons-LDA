                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for CUNY cafe is due to our experiences getting coffee at campus coffee shops. We were frustrated with the long lines, credit card minimums, and having to leave campus to buy coffee.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application will allow CUNY students to buy coffee at the local campus via PayPal and other payment methods.  You can also order coffee for pickup.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Cordova (PhoneGap).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had issues with layout, JavaScript rendering, and other design problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud in turning a web page into a mobile application.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The whole team learned web development skills to create a mobile app. The team can agree that we learned more in one hackathon than a semester compsci class.

                    We would like to provide the same service for SUNY schools.
