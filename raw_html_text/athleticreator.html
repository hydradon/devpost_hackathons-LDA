                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nick, Jackson's brother, was trying to make his own Madden NFL 18 character, but he did not know where to begin. Jackson and Nick both had been frustrated with the total lack of realism in any Create Your Own Player system in any sports-related game. Either the player ended up being completely overpowered, they were overly weak, or they were a pitiful attempt at a realistic player. Our goal was to make their visions a reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program asks the user a series of questions, varying in intensity and specificity, that determine everything about the most realistic player for them according to their own person in real life! Some questions subsequently factor into each other, as well, thus further increasing the realism and heightened inter-connectivity. We begin by prompting the user to answer several questions that apply to any of the major sports which form the basis of the player's traits, the final question of which asks the user to specify which games/sports they are interested in further fine-tuning. We then ask them a series of highly-specific questions in accordance to the sport(s) they select. These questions make their character as realistic and fine-tuned as possible, according to the sport in question and the user themselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First we mathematically derived a formula to determine the weights of each skill makeup, as well as determine a scale and rating from the question that we provide the users to answer. Next, we designed a cross-platform user interface in Microsoft C# .NET framework to make the user's answers as easy as possible to reply to. In the back-end, we used C# to parse all the data, and run it through the proprietary algorithm that we developed which will output a skill depending on the actual question type.

                    Determining questions that would maximize the accuracy of a player to their real-life persona, as well as figuring out relative importance for each skill factor, then weighing the skills.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    We're proud of having been able to conceptualize, design, and implement this program in under 24 hours, as well as having been able to design a better .NET user interface than we had previously ever done.

                <p>
                    We learned how to design quality C# .NET user interfaces from scratch.

                <p>
                    We plan to expand our program to a wider range of athletic games and fine tune our algorithm to even better resemble the user.
