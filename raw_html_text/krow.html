                    We provide a central database of local cafes, libraries, and generally accessible workplaces listed by the availability of criteria that are particularly important to our target demographic.

                    Our backend is hosted on Firebase Firestore.
Our Android client uses as few external libraries as possible. 
This is our dependency list:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Android Support Library
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Google Maps Android API
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Firebase Firestore
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Firebase Core

                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make sure the app runs under bad network conditions and has an offline cache. See next header.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to produce a well-designed functional product that displays detailed results obtained from the user's input.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our search functionality is incredibly fast and persistent even in times of low network availability.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to function efficiently under pressure along with having a time constraint.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned to improvise and compromise due to differing opinions of team members.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Krow
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We aim to integrate more profile related features such as favourite places and filters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We want to expand to other platforms starting with web and ideally building a code base for every major operating system in use today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, we'd like to expand past the boundaries of NYC and find other cities with a similar growing trend of remote workers.
