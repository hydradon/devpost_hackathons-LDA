                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the CAMH Mental Health prompt as well as our own personal experiences with mental health in University. This past semester, we were all first-year engineering students at the beginning of the semester. As friends hit rough points throughout the semester, they were able to receive help through therapy and medication. However, many students were apprehensive about using prescription medication and were afraid of the symptoms, side-effects, and how usable the medication truly was. We hoped to make an application which could help break down some of the stigmas around prescription medication as well as provide users with a reminder service to remember their medication.

                    Mood Ring provides users with the ability to track their mood, prescription intake, and their symptoms. The Mood Ring has initially focused on prescriptions which focus on Mood Disorders. This included a large focus on medication such as SSRIs and SNRIs. Users complete daily logs to regular question prompt and also receive push notifications through e-mail and SMS. Mood Ring also always users to export their mental health data to mental health professionals or view data trends over time so they can track progress and symptoms.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mood Ring was built on the front end side, using HTML/CSS and Javascript to create a fully functional website. This allowed us to create an interactive and user-friendly design. Certain frameworks like vue.js were used to allow us to create programmable features on the website. The back-end of the website was created using Django and Python to create a database and store the daily logs in a database. This database is then used to graph trends and is sorted through by days.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A major challenge that we ran into was combining the front-end and back-end together. Once the HTML/CSS was complete, it had to be used in the Django file. There were many different issues with the combination that we had not anticipated. Images would disappear, data would be lost, and the formatting of CSS could be ignored. These problems taught us how to look for help through mentors as well as utilizing the power of the internet to create a useful tool.

                    I am proud of my ability to take my wireframe and recreate it as a fully functional HTML/CSS website. It was by far the most intense web development I have done and it was also a great introduction to using Javascript. -Julia Turner

                    The next plan for Mood Ring is looking at creating a mobile application and creating service that could sync the results between the two servers. We would also be looking at fixing some of the bugs, we were not able to fix during this Hackathon. Overall, Mood Ring looks
