                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of us were brought together by our passion to save the environment. Andrew, one of the members of our team, thought of the idea to help consumers switch from gas/diesel cars to a more environmentally friendly option. We slowly fleshed out the idea and now have a working app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses the Google Maps API to track the distance a car travels in a trip and uses data to see how much money the user spends on gas using their diesel car.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using android studio, Google Maps API,
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Google Maps API and being able to track location in the app as well as the distance between two points.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we have a working app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to make an app and a website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Eco-nomics
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully, we can use the website and the app we developed to create a cross-platform program. We also want to expand into other areas like electronics usage and water usage in the office and figure out where we can save people money in those areas.
