                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are inspired by music. We listen to music most of time in a day from when we wake up until we go to bed. We listen to the music when we enjoy our time with friends and family, when we work, whenever we can. We joined this hackathon to create interactive digital art inspired by music and we are proud with what we managed to achieve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teaching robots to perform human skills is not an easy task. Over the weekend we managed to enable Amazon Echo to play one of our favourite songs on guitar and therefor we named this project &ldquo;The Sun&rdquo;. We hope you&rsquo;ll enjoy watching this robotic performance as much as we while creating it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Amazon Echo skill which is able to interact with Lego Mindstorms. Mindstorms use several motors in order to be able to pick different chords and hit the strings on guitar. Alexa, the voice assistant behind Amazon Echo, will pronounce predefined lyrics and interact with Lego Mindstorm to play the music.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alexa skill was written in Node.js and Lego Mindstorms control program is written in Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a challenge to build the robot able to play guitar out of Lego bricks we had with us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are really proud with this interactive digital art we built, it wasn&rsquo;t an easy task and it required a lot of effort to make it happen in such short time frame.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We already attended several hackathons as a team, but still we learned even more about how we perform as a team, what are our strengths and what each one of us should improve in work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Sun
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We&rsquo;ll try to extend this project even more so chords picker can be much more dynamic. First of all, we&rsquo;ll write blogpost about this project and share our code in hope this will inspire others to create similar solutions. Even tho we see this as an art project we believe that advancements in robotics can be applied widely, so hopefully it can influence some advancement for greater good.
