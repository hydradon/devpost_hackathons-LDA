                    A 2D jump'n'jump (we're talking about a bunny with a pogo stick, so there's not much running involved) featuring a slightly suicidal bunny. Randomly throughout the game,
                    <em>
                        suicide mode
                    </em>

                    This means the player has to deliberately

                        jump into deadly traps to stay alive
                    </strong>

                    </em>
                    game engine was used in this project. I have been loosely following its development ever since it has been released under an open source license by
                    <em>
                        Okam Studio
                    </em>
                    but never found the time to actually build something with it.
This is why I decided to try Godot in the course of this Hackathon and I really liked it!
