                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I love exercising, and getting fit. I wanted to create an app that made it as easy as possible to get other people fit, and fitting routines exactly to people's genes profiles is a way of helping them do that. The best exercises just for you!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After downloading your genetic profile, we look at a bunch of markers and select exercises that will work best for you. From there, you can choose which ones you want to do, and how long you have, so each routine fits into your busy day. We look at genetic reports including BMI, body-fat-mass, carb-intake, endurance-performance, extraversion, genetic-weight, intelligence, lean-body-mass, morning-person, and novelty-seeking to come up with routines that keep you interested and fit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app also records your routines with Apple Health.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it with Xcode in Objective-C, swift, and using several libraries such as NXOauth, AYSlidingMenu, reportLogger, and CADVoteCount.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting oauth working and accessing the data wasn't easy. 
Creating a useful UI that worked and was easy to follow was not easy.
Thinking about how to create useful exercises out of gene markers available.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming up with a working app and getting that into the app store. Getting it working with Apple health. Coming up with an interesting but working UI&gt;
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about genetics and what sort of data we can get out.
Learned about Apple health.
Learned about Yoga, I had never done anything with that before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for genexercise
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is now out on the app store, the next step is to create more exercises, improve the UI, create a web and android version.
