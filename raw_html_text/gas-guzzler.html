                    We came up with Gas Guzzler Robots to solve one of the biggest problems we faced when we first experienced the Ethereum platform - gas mistakes!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We think it's a huge bummer when users submit a transaction that runs out of gas. No one enjoys seeing their hard-earned Ether go to waste, so we came up with an idea -
                    <strong>
                        why not commemorate our failures with something fun
                    </strong>
                    ?
                </p>
                <p>
                    As total rookie Ethereum developers, the ERC721 specification for Non-Fungible Tokens seemed like the best way to achieve our goal. We built out a quick proof-of-concept application that allows users to submit a transaction hash to our smart contract and receive ownership of a unique crypto-collectible - a Gas Guzzler Robot. Our Solidity smart contract creates the unique NFTs, and our React front-end application renders images of our Robots and allows MetaMask users to interact with a local blockchain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Along the way, we learned a lot - many of our initial plans were changed as we learned more and more about developing for the Ethereum ecosystem, but plenty of our ideas did manage to make it into the final application. We wanted to develop a marketplace for trading these Robots - so people who lost gas money could recover some of it by selling relics of their mistakes - but that ended up being a little too much for the timeframe.

                    We were fortunate to have been able to leverage awesome tools created by the community - we used React Truffle Box (

                    </a>
                    ) to build out our proof-of-concept. Huge thanks to all the people who built out this infrastructure and made such a fun thing possible, and of course - thank you to the ETHDenver organizers for making our first development experience with Ethereum so awesome.
