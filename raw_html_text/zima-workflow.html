                <p>
                    Most of the times we face this in real life that the laptop that we carry goes down on battery, or we
                    <strong>
                        forget some file in our PC
                    </strong>
                    which is in our Office/Home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was required that we could
                    <strong>
                        get some files
                    </strong>
                    like sales figures, reports that we have already prepared from our PC to our mobile while on the move. Also from our mobile we could give commands to our PC to
                    <strong>
                        prepare charts, reports etc, while we moving
                    </strong>
                    , and get back on the mobile as attachment.
                </p>

                    What it does

                <p>
                    It send  an email, which is received by outlook configured on the PC. These emails are read by the UiPath automation framework and then it takes the appropriate action based on the subject/body it receives in the email.
