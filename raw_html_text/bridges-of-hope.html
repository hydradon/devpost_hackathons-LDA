                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to reach out to the less fortunate in Vietnam, specifically the orphans. 
Our website aims to spread the message and love of God; enables us to bring more resources to children in need.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website provides information about our missionary and encourages people to join and stay connected with our church.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built with Angular 8 framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our small two-person team led to more responsibility for each teammate. One of our members was new to the Angular framework and it is also his first time at a Hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to learn a new framework and explore our creativity within a restricted time limit was a challenge that helped us grow as developers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to work with limited resources and rest when necessary. Our effectiveness with the Angular framework also improved.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bridges of Hope
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to further expand the community with additional user interaction features such as user login and a chatbot. Implementation of data analysis will help us improve the user's experience as well.
