                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to create this app because of the horrendous experience we faced pulling tickets for football games. You have to line up outside Kyle Field in the hot sun, and although ticket pulling this way is a tradition at TAMU, we believe it needed to be overhauled.

                    What it does / How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In an ideal world we would have access to TAMU student database and be able to use that along with sports pass to effectively and efficient provide students with their tickets. However because we don't have such a database we decided to create one ourselves. By learning a bit of SQL and our python knowledge we were able to develop a way to create and modify databases of students who would create an account on the app. From there the student would form a group of other students who also created an account on the app and thus have provided us with their classification and sports pass id. From there the ticket puller would create the group and request tickets for how many people. Based on the group size, classification and time we would provide tickets to the assigned students similar to how they do it at Kyle field. And in keeping in tradition, this request would only go through if during the allocated time slot (IE: Monday for seniors, Tuesday for Juniors, etc.). We would email the tickets with its QR code to the email address associated with the accounts and Aggies would be able to pull tickets from the comfort of A/C.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many challenges developing this "app". I put app in quotation marks because there is no front-end. We were initially going to create the app using Android studio, however ran into multiple problems with incorporating the database, out unfamiliarity with java and the fact that we had already written the back-end in python and were unable to convert all into java. James worked for 14 trying to get it to work until we decided to ditch the idea and use a python based GUI. However at that point we were tired and learning how to incorporate it turned out unsuccessful. Additionally organization and time management were obstacles as it took hours just to decide who was doing what and how they the code would flow from one part to another. In the end we were only able to create a console application, quite a let down from our goal.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'd proud of our determination to stay up for so long with the intent on finishing the app. Time after time issues arose, and along with them came frustration. Despite not being successful, I can confidently say we tried out best even if the fatigue eventually got to us. Still we did produce some sort of a prototype, even if its buggy and disorganized.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that the most important step in undertaking any kind of project is organization. Only after we all stopped and really took some time to plan out the details of how the code would come together with diagrams and tables were we able to achieve some real progress. I also learned that most things don't pan out as you expect and coming to a consensus is sometimes just as much of a challenge as the technician ones, if not more. I l look towards to the next Hackathon to show what I have learned!

                    What's next for AggiePull
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have agreed to meet up sometime and finish the project fully, at a time when we aren't sleep deprived and hungry, and have a better grasp on the concepts we were exploring such as client side vs server side, and how to connect front-end to back end. Maybe we will implement it through a website instead, but its not the end of AggiePull.
