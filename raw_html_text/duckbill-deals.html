                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As college students, we are limited on money, yet still want to go out to eat with our friends. In order to not spend too much money, we are always on the lookout for discounts, but finding them can be difficult and time consuming. We wanted to build an app that would save college students both time and money.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Duckbill Deals consolidates all of the information about restaurants in Hoboken that take Duckbills. This information includes descriptions of the restaurants and their discounts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to create the functioning app. For our UI, we used Marvel App to simulate the potential end product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have limited coding experience, so we had to do a lot of research in order to learn the necessary skills. We also had many attempts to add either a side menu or search bar in Android Studio, but we were unable to implement it in the specified time frame; however, it is shown in the UI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even though our skills were limited, we came together to create a functioning app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned new coding skills. Also, we learned about the entrepreneurial side of start ups.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Duckbill Deals
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to have Duckbill Deals implemented at Stevens and eventually expand to other colleges across the nation.
