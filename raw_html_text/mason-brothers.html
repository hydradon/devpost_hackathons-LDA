                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We drew inspiration for our puzzles from the various terrain puzzles in Pokemon and other old school 2D scrolling games. We thought that with the advanced VR technologies now, we could make an immersive first person VR game with similar game concepts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EnvoPuzzle is a mobile VR game that provides an immersive VR experience on GearVR, without the need for extravagant hardware. Unlike most other VR games on the market, with EnvoPuzzle, players can have full control of their in-game movements through real life body movements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized the pedometer in our mobile device, and adapted a step detector API. We then fed the data of player&rsquo;s step frequency to Unity (VR game Engine) where we developed the gameplay in C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had challenges with solidifying our central game play philosophy.  Sliding motion and collision detection were also quite hard to implement properly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More than half of our team had no prior game development or VR development experience. We&rsquo;re very proud of how much we all have learned from this hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EnvoPuzzle
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Incorporate Leap Motion hand movement detection to our VR game, and create more adventurous environments where players are required to use various gestures to solve more complex puzzles.
