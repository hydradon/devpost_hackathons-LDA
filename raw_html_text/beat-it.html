                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by being able to leverage AI to create content based on a user's needs. We wanted to explore how AI could help young and coming rappers with their content creation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on a user's lyrics, we generate a beat, consisting of hi-hats, snares, kick, a melody and a set of chords. This is then given to the user to allow them to rap over this beat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the predictive model and beat generator in Python using TensorFlow's magenta library. We also used Google Cloud to analyze speech to text when a user would record into a microphone. The web app was built with HTML and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a hard time choosing the right instruments and making sure the beat generator was generating a beat in sync with the user's lyrical flow.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to successfully generate a rap beat with all the main components. We were also able to integrate many different many pieces of technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the benefits of technology on the music industry and how much more there is to explore in this space.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Beat It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to refine our algorithm to create a wide variety of beats that cater to other content creators who are trying to get their feet of the ground.
