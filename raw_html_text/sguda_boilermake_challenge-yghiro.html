                    Inspiration: One of my interests is to build and solve puzzles, which cryptography enables me to do both.

                    What it does: It encrypts a string message with 6 different Caesar ciphers to ultimately create an extremely difficult string message to break.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it: I coded this encryption in Java via the Intellij platform
                </h2>

                    Challenges I ran into: Mostly figuring out what I wanted to do, as well as attempting to learn new skills as a result.

                <h2>
                    What I learned: I originally wanted to make this code into a website, so as a result I learned some HTML and CSS as a result, however I could not figure out how to sync my java code into webstorm html platform
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for sguda_BoilerMake_Challenge: I could learn how to do the sync.
