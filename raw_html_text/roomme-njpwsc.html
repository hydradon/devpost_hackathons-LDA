                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've had roommate troubles in the past, so we decided to make something to help us change that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It keeps track of tasks and activities among roommates, and by gamifying these task using a reward system to motivate everyone to commit to the community.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The two biggest obstacles we ran into were version control and Firebase Documentation/Database

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We completed our core features, and we made decent looking app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Take heed when it comes to version control.

                    What's next for roomMe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like add more database support, and more features that allow communication with other people in your group. We would also like to add extension apps to further enhance the experience of roomMe such as Venmo, Google Calendar, and GroupMe. We are also considering creating a game where people can spend their credits.
