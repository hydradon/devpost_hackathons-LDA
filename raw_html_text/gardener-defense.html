                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were simply trying to come up with an idea for a short interactive game that would be both enjoyable to play and keeping the gamer wanting more
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You start at the homescreen where you are able to choose amongst three garden gnomes, you are then brought to the instructions page where you will learn how to play. Once you are ready for the task, shoot those darn rabbits! You start with four lives and once four rabbits get to your crops, the game is over.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We simply imported the pygame library and used it's functions to implement the code we needed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were a few methods we did not quite understand right away and had to stay up all night looking them over. Once we figured those tricky methods we were rolling again and the rest was smooth sailing
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The finished product of course!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pygame is a fun and easy library to create simple code for a complex game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Garden Defense
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on creating it's sequal at the next hackisu, so stayed tuned for more fun and exciting updates!
                </p>
