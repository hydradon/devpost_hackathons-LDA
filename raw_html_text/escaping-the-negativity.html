                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to work on a project that surrounded some common issues women may deal with on a day-to-day basis, and we hoped to help encourage them to persevere as well as let them know they are not alone. We researched on google that the top three most common challenges that women face are inequality/discrimination, not fitting in, and a lack of support and understanding. Using the idea of Cry of Fear's Camera Flash scenes, we adapted it into a metaphor for the subconsciousness where a player can be easily trapped and lost in darkness. Many of the phrases used in this game allude to the topics mentioned in our research, involving thoughts or words that were said that can weigh you down in difficult situations. The negative messages are symbolic of the negative thoughts that can easily consume our minds and keep us spiraling, while it is the positive ones that can help us move forward.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Like any maze game, the goal is to find the right path to reach the other end. In our game, the path to escape is by following the positive messages hidden among all the negatives on the maze walls. The player must use their flashlight to find them and navigate the maze using the WASD keys and their mouse.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Unity in C#. The artistic aspects such as the visuals on the walls were created using Krita.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With little to no experiences using Unity, our main challenge was simply learning how to navigate and transform our ideas into moving parts. There were also many scary moments when we thought our working code was going to be overwritten since we were also new to using git and github.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having a working game!!! We both came into AthenaHacks with a vision to create this game and we are happy that we didn't have to deviate from the original idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how rigorous 24-hour hackathons can be but also what we can accomplish with little resources, knowledge, and time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Escaping the Negativity
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bigger mazes with more complex paths along with path choices like a text adventure style!
