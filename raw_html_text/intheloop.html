                    NCR's Workshop with the different scenarios inspired us to find  and create solutions regarding the nature of pop-up shops
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our app will be accessible to both vendors and customers. Customers will be able to choose from different categories of pop-up shops. Once the customer chooses their desired category, a map with several vendors related to that specific category will appear. From there, the customer can pick the best shop. Vendors will be able to keep track of their inventory, banking details, maintain their menu, and post their current location. The app will also allow vendors to say how long they will stay in the area, allowing customers to know when their favorite shop leaves as well as when it will come back.

                    We built it using Android Studio and Flutter

                <h2>
                    We were not familiar with Android Studio and its syntax so we faced several issues while trying to build.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of was getting to understand Andriod Studio enough to create a small portion of our vision.
