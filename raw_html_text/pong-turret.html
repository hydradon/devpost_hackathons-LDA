                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Salmon MHacks shirts + computer vision + ping pong balls = Pong Turret.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The turret homes and launches ping pong balls at a specifically trained color.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used some PVC, some wooden dowel, a stepper motor, a DC motor, 2 motor drivers, a CMULabs Pixy Cam, and lots of hot glue. I first built the mechanics, then tested and programmed the camera code to track the trained color. When that worked I got the motors to run and combined separate code into a functioning ping pong launcher.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The mechanics were one of the hardest problems to solve. The next hardest problem was calibrating the camera with the hardware.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    I'm surprised that I got it to work! It's pretty accurate.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Raspberry Pi is much nicer to use for hardware GPIO than I previously thought. I learned a bit of python and some hardware as well.
                </p>

                    What's next for Pong Turret
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nothing, really. I enjoyed the hack and I hope everyone else did as well.
