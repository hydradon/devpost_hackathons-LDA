                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes, We can not hear what is said during announcements, or what's for lunch in the cafeteria, so we decided to make this information more easily accessible.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You send a message to the bot, and it replies with the required information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally, we decided to use web hooks to connect an external software to the bot, but due to difficulties, we were not able to do that. We then used Chatfeul, which makes it easier to update and set options for

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web hooks did not send information between the code and the bot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found a way to make it easier for admins to change and add new information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is extremely hard to set up web hooks when working as a beginner. We also learned how to use git and heroku commands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for INFORU
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Expand to more schools, and add more options for Admins to be able to change the information. Make it easier to update new info.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was our first Hackathon for most of our teammates, so we learned a lot about coding and the many different platforms we could use.
