                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a computer science student, I have many ideas about making programs. However, most of the time, I couldn't find teammates that can help me realize my ideas, so I wanted to make an app that can help students to find teammates.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can post their ideas in the app. An "idea" is consists of Project Name, Project Description, and Number of needed members. These posted ideas are visible for all the users and all the users are able to join this project. Once you join the project, you will be able to see other teammates' email addresses so that you can get together and work on the project! The good idea will never go anymore!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use Android studio to build the app. We also used Google Firebase to store all the information(posted projects, user info, etc). 
This app took us around 20 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The hardest part of this app is retrieving data from firebase and writing data to firebase since we both never used Firebase in Android App before.
UI design is also pretty hard because we both never do design before, but playing with colors is pretty fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realized our basic concepts in just 20 hours!
Our app has its own icon, pretty design, user-friendly environment.
Team project experience is very important in interviews.
Therefore, this app is very useful for all cs students and has great potential to be the most popular app for all the students!

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Never give up, even there are many many bugs!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tiny Hack
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to make another section that displays great apps that are made by teams that are formed in this app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since it happens sometimes that many cs students want to make something great but has no idea about what to make, we would like to add a section that can inspire those students. This section might be a discussion board or simply a list of fun ideas that are posted by other users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are confident that this will become one of the best apps for cs students ever!
