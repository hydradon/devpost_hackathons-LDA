                    How many times have you had to plan for a trip and researched everything. The flights, hotels, things to do while you're there, things to see. You go on your trip, and once you&rsquo;ve come back from your trip, that itinerary is in the past. All that effort and research that you put into that itinerary is now lost. Now what if you could share that itinerary, your reviews on the experiences you just had, what was good and bad, and make money for each person you helped book a similar package? You could use our app to plan and fund your next trip! That is what we&rsquo;ve built for you this weekend.
