                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Companies often require a verifiable Proof of Location, but traditional metrics like GPS are easy to spoof. We built Geo to provide a protocol which allows anyone to easily distribute and verify Proofs of Location in a decentralized network without a need for massive overhead.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Geo is centered around Nodes, which are devices set at a fixed physical location. Using the Geo universal mobile app, users can connect to nodes via Bluetooth and receive a Proof of Location signature. This signature is unique in that it requires the user to be physically present at the location, which can be used to demonstrate presence at a certain time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Geo has two pathways for distributing signatures. In the first case, users can opt to keep their signatures private and stored on their device. When a user wants to provide the Proof of Location, the validator can invoke a Smart Contract which verifies the Proof of Location (i.e. that the user was at the specified location at the specified time).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second case is intended for public systems, such as a Geocaching game. Proof of Location signatures are stored on a server, providing a queryable API for Smart Contracts via Oraclize. In doing so, it is possible for a Smart Contract to verify the past location of a user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Geo is multi-platform in order to accommodate for a global market. Nodes are written in Node.js and can be run on any Bluetooth-enabled device, such as a desktop, tablet, or Arduino.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Geo mobile app is written universally in Ionic, which allows it to be deployed on any mobile operating system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The mobile app and node communicate via Bluetooth, with the node ultimately returning the Proof of Location signature.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In creating Geo, it was necessary to build a comprehensive protocol that could be trusted as a Proof of Location. We wanted a way that it could be certain that a user visited a certain location at a time without compromising user privacy. Though there may still be some limited potential for exploits, the model we created ensures that it is only possible to obtain a valid signature by physically visiting a node.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In terms of development, the most difficult feature to integrate was Bluetooth communication between the node and user. After some rather agonizing moments, we were able to successfully implement Bluetooth.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There's many potential applications that can be built utilizing Geo, whether loyalty rewards for companies or a decentralized Geocaching game. We're excited to see where Geo will go from here, and will continue building applications on top of the protocol.
