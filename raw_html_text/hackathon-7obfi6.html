                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a fun side scroller for everyone at a hackathon!

                </h2>
                <p>
                    You race against others while avoiding obstacles and hacking obstacles/other players courses to win the race!

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built using Javascript and the Crafty.js library
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm new to Javascript while my partner is a big Javascript fan, so my challenges were learning how to use Javascript as well as the library to create a game image. Another obstacle was the use of socket.io. The game is supposed to use socket.io for networking but we were unable to get it working before time ran out.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned Javascript and how to use the Crafty library somewhat.

                    What's next for Hackathon
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Get it running with socket.io and have a progress bar/ghost racing to see the status of other players. Also implement two hacks to assist the hacker as well as one to attack other racers by messing with their course.
