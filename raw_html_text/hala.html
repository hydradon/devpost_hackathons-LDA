                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One day I was thinking how great would it be to chat with people that are in the same place that you are, to receive localised help and advise. That seed kept growing and growing and today is a reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a geolocalized social network, each landmark in Google Places has the potential to become a social network (you only need to walk to one and log in!).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Right now the app has a chat functionality, but a photo gallery is under the works.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What makes it different from any social network? well, you have to
                    <strong>
                        BE
                    </strong>
                    at the place where you wanna talk, if you are not physically on your school, you will not be able to neither read or write on it's social network.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We split the team into two, Didac and Raquel worked on the Android version and Marina worked on the iOS version.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both versions are powered by Sentilo, a cloud database with the IoT in mind.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have had a few challenges, the first was that the Android team was new at it and that slowed them down compared to the iOS side.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another important one, was to think of how to structure the system to be able to use this kind of database and make it into a social network.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And lastly, both teams were new at using REST API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Android team is really proud of how much they have accomplished, going from zero to where they are now has been a great experience for them!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The iOS team is also proud to have been able to finish it, being only one person.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have linked the whole world to the Sentilo API, transforming every single landmark into a hub of sensors, the potential this can achieve (Big Data, etc...) is alluring.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learned a lot of new skills and honed some we already had, overall it has been an incredibly productive weekend!

                    Photos! and a fully finished Android version. And, of course, release!
                </p>
