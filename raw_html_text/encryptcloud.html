                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Now a days, people's privacy is given very little value. Many companies openly sell user data, and don't make an effort to protect it. The state has many programs for mass surveilance, and there is very little information about them. Many people are ignorant, and don't seem to see the importance of privacy and anonymity. Also inspired by Edward Snowden.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EncryptCloud is an opensource encrypted cloud. All files coming through are encrypted with AES, so even we cannnot see what the files are. EncryptedCloud runs on tor, so your identity is anonymous. No one other than you has control over your data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python, TOR, AES Encryption, Redis and Flask to build the backend. Our website is coded with HTML and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulty implementing the encryption and running an anonymous web server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are to provide an open, encrypted solution to the problem of anonymity and privacy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use TOR as well as AES Encryption inorder to create a totally private service.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EncryptCloud
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To provide more anonymity services such as Bitcoin Tumblers, anonymous remailers and anonymous irc chat rooms.
