                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To promote real-time information sharing and decision making between the public, first responders, and disaster relief teams.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provide real-time stream flow from the closest station, and provide a data collector app to map where problems are
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python to call USGS stream flow data server and feed the flow data to Google map and use ESRI product to develop the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have the challenge to map locations on Google Map via Python, and we were still unable to feed the stream flow information to ArcGIS online.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our solution can provide live information to the public, first responders, and disaster relief members.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As our first Hackathon project, we learned how to communicate and incorporate two different programming languages.
                </p>

                    What's next for GEOLINKS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Feed the stream flow information to ArcGIS online, and on Google map and try to provide a navigation solution to assist users in finding alternative routes.
