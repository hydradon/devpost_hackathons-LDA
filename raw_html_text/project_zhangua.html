                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My partner Yilun Hua and I both interested in Chinese I Ching. I Ching is a famous literature to analyze people's fortune by their birthdays, born environment, and a lot of exterior factors. Nowadays, people live in a high speed environment and they experience a lot of pressure from work and family. My partner and I aim to design a program that can tell people their levels of luck to finish a task.
