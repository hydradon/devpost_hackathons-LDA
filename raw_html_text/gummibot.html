                    Inspiration,
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So we use discord on almost a daily basis playing games after school with each other. We see theres a few bots out there that make the server pretty neat, but most you have to pay for, when we found out we could do it ourselves that kinda sweetened the deal for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So far, 
-We have multiple commands you can say to get a response from the bot
-We have the bots fully automated and talking to each other using a closed source cleverbot.api
-we are able to request music to be played in any server we want (this is something a lot of bots charge for)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -mostly Javascript
-some python
-blood
-sweat
-tears
-many hot cheetoes
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At 4 in the morning my part of the bot took a dump and wouldn't work, so during trouble shooting, we had bash explaining to me how I can fix it, then fell dead asleep a few times mid sentence before we fixed it. Major S/O to him.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -we didnt know any code coming into this event, and know we have a few hundred lines of javascript fully functional.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -do NOT panic in a time crunch
-javascript can be messy
-VERY messy.
-When your two team members leave an hour after the event starts, you will be okay... maybe.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GummiBot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well, we were hoping to take it home and after LOTS of work, maybe one day we could licenseour bots to people. The future of gummibot looks promising!
