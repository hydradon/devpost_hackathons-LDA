                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In a year, about 6 lakhs pregnant mothers are registered in Chhattisgarh itself. Among them 90% (about 5,40,000) receive first round of ANC which keeps on decreasing exponentially to only 15% (about 90,000) who receive proper health care including all the prescribed 4 visits and have a safe delivery. Just imagine the loss of the remaining mothers due to either miscarriage or improper health care.
As we know, children are the future of our country, its important that we have proper health care facilities for the newborn and the mother. Moreover its said &ndash;
Prevention is better than cure !! 
Thus we want to apply our technical knowledge with the noble cause of UNICEF for creating a proper knowledge base for the rural pregnant ladies about all the 4 ANC Visits , Dos and Donts during pregnancy, Symptoms and solutions which otherwise is treated by the orthodox and obsolete solutions which are sometimes quite harmful.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Problems solved:-
&bull; Details about all the 4 visits of ANC and the related tests and vaccinations for each trimester.
&bull; A reminder alarm which notifies the patient about the date and days on which the tests and visits are to be done.
&bull; Specific advice to the problems both physical and mental, which arises during specific time duration or certain weeks.
&bull; Preventive measures for the problems due to abnormalities in the test.
&bull; List of all the ANC centers in the nearby location would be shown to the patient so that in case of checkup reminder the patient can visit the PHC for tests and vaccines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Innovations ( Our Special Features ):-
&bull; Food Lookup- Certain food if consumed are dangerous during pregnancy, thus this option tells all the food items that can be taken and all that are harmful to consume.
&bull; Symptoms Remedy option- Certain problems like constipation or leg cramps are common throughout the pregnancy, to handle such symptoms the patient can click on the specific symptom and know the remedy.
&bull; Emergency calling system to one of Primary Health Center in case the patient suffers any emergency.
&bull; Implementation of Machine Learning is also ready which requires the dataset which would be trained by the database created during the use of app, which predicts the health and consulting time for the emergency of the patient.

                    We have used android studio for application coding, django platform for database and backend. We have used adobe illustrator for designing and logo making purpose so as to have attractive user interface. Retrofit is used to have interaction with the database.
