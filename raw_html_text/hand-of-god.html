                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The theme for the Junction 2017 Game Jam was "Melt". Rather quickly, we associated this with ice melting on Earth, an effect if global warming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project is a VR game in which you see the whole planet and people walking around on it, trying to reach the ice caps and melt them. Your job is to move these people away from ice (or throw them away into space, if you get desperate). Occasionally, a meteor will also threaten the planet. Save Earth for as long as you can!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built with Unity, VR used was Vive. Song was made with GarageBand. Most sound effects recorded / made on spot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since all 5 of us were mostly coders task parallelisation was an issue. People knew how parts of the code worked but not necessarily the whole picture.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to stay positive for the whole time, and supported each other. We did great in using new to us technology - which was VR in our case.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more Unity, to work as a team, communicate more. To develop under time pressure and perhaps save time for bug fixes
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hand of God
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We regard this as a useful and fun learning experience, and we will more on to other ongoing projects.
