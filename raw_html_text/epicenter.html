                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make Smart Cities even Smarter. In 2015, GE partnered with the city of San Diego to create a truly smart city. Our application, EPICenter, conceptualizes the next step in making cities truly smart.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EPICenter simulates the movement of people around the Minds and Machine Conference here in San Francisco. You'll see that as people move, clusters are formed, and a colour and number assigned. The number represents how many people are in that cluster and the colour how dense of a  population that in comparison to the population of the greater area.  This scale changes as you zoom in and out of the map.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This application has multiple use cases.
For Security:
 -Optimizing resources on social and political events.
-Predicting security threats.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For Retail:
-Smart advertising based on visibility
-Premium charges for &ldquo;busy&rdquo; billboards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For Government:
-Smart city planning.
-Energy saving.
-Improve emergency response.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a whole host of technologies. We have a time-series database on the backend controlled by a springboot Java Application. This feeds the data through to a node Javascript project which includes a whole host of  external libraries. Our foundation was the smallworld sample project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The whole application is protected by UAI to ensure only those privileged groups who should have access to should.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time! As with all hackathons, the learning curve is steep and there is not much time to debug issues which can mean changes of direction are necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The time-series database was difficult to get running and as a team we had knowledge gaps which we had to fill quickly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Morale stayed high throughout the project and we worked really well as a team.
We had a lot of knowledge gaps that we worked hard to fill.
We created a fully functional product that completely works!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about the benefits of micro service architecture, and how Predix can help us to move fast.
                </p>

                    What's next for EPICenter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That's up to you! We would love to continue development but we will need support from the business.
