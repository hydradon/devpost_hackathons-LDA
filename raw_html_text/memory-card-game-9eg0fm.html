                    I have developed this memory card game with java which anybody can use from children to seniors with three main purposes: relaxation, memory improvement, and learning. I have targeted three groups of people but one in particular. Adults who want downtime could definitely enjoy this game. Additionally, children who are learning their numbers and alphabets can learn from an interactive experience. No adult would want their kid to be watching TV for long, but infants and toddlers in the modern day and age watch TV for more than three hours. Instead, playing this interactive learning tool for 20-30 minutes could help a child learn. Lastly, seniors with Alzheimer's are the people for which this game is most directed towards. My grandma has Alzheimer's  and it is very disheartening to see loved ones, in a sense, lose remembrance of another loved one. With that in mind,  I thought I would create a game that could benefit others similar to my grandma. Exercising the memory daily will increase the patient&rsquo;s memory likewise exercising the muscles will also improving memory. I hope this game could not only be used for enjoyment but also to provide a potential solution to Alzheimer's without using medicines with side effects. 
The memory card game consists of 42 cards that one has to match. According to how many matched, the player's score will increase. I used java to create this program, specifically mouse listeners, graphics(GUI), and a myriad number of fields and methods.
I built the memory card game using two classes: one for the graphics and images of the card and the second controlling the functions of the game.
The main challenges I ran into were making sure that the card would not be allowed to be clicked twice. This would make it very easy for the user as the player would win points very easily. Additionally, when the card was matched and disappeared, the place where the card no longer was still functional(if pressed, it would still make noises and increase the score). I fixed this by saying: if the card that has been clicked once has the exact same reference as the second one clicked, it will not accept it.
I am proud to create a game that can be multifunctional: beneficial to patients who have Alzheimer's disease, a great learning tool for young children, a relaxation tool for adults and kids.
I learned how powerful Java is; if one knows the way to code, the programmer has immense control over the language and can create anything imaginable.
My next step for the memory card game is creating the version that kids can use to learn(currently, this version is for seniors and adults).
