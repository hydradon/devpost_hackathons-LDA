                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    UiPath has many activities unfortunately till now it don't have for file compress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This custom activity is a single stop point for all file purge activities (Delete, Move, Copy and Compress&amp;Move).  Based on user selection this custom activity will act. The core logic is, it will evaluate cut of days which is given by user with file / folder created date if the condition is true then selected purge action will be performed and end result return as boolean as well as status message.  Add on that, It will create destination folder if not exist and result file will be uniquely named by adding datetime.
