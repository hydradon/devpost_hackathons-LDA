                    So many people in a community have a wide array of talents and passions which they pursue. They can work towards their interests by collaborating on projects that better their community while utilizing what they love most. I hope for this website's idea to be the framework for creating an initiative where civic and social entrepreneurship is inspired in communities and connecting to others with similar interests becomes easier.
