                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming to our first ever hackathon we found that our journeys could have been made much simpler with an app like Friendezvous - as we all came from different parts of the country.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Friendezvous allows you to create a meeting place and invite your friends, providing you all with real-time updates on progress towards the destination. Meaning if anyone is running late, everyone will automatically know - so they can grab a cup of coffee while they wait!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We explored options of using native apps for mobile devices to use background GPS data to track the friends' journeys. However, due to time constraints and lack of prior knowledge in this domain, we opted for a web app. As this still allows most of the features we desired, but reduces the complexity substantially. We also wanted to respect the privacy of all our potential users, therefore we opted to using their estimated travel time to share with friends, rather than their exact location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not everyone in our team was familiar with web development, and even those that were found it a steep learning curve to master using different APIs and combining many skills to create a working product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that in such a short time, we've managed to create a working web app, though it still needs a lot of work. We believe our idea is novel, and may indeed explore a gap in the market.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each of our members have been exposed to new skills and have learnt or re-enforced knowledge in the web development, software planning and team work domains.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Friendezvous
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to turn it into a native app on Android and IOS as this would allow more intuitive and natural use of the app. We would also like to include more features, for example a "home safe" feature, where users can mark a place as home. And after a 'Friendezvous', friends will be able to see that everyone has gotten home safely - or if they need assistance.
