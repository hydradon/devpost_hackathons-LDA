                    The goal of this hack was to try to see just how much of a user facing interface for a novel computer graphics problem I could churn out. The original scope was to have dynamic video generation included, but as it normally turns out, I underestimate just how many issues I can run into with OpenCV.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea serves two purposes: 
1) DIY hologram projectors that you can make out of plastic are sick, and there's only a handful of videos that people can try with at home.
2) A unique and eye-popping way to show off some of the AI based computer animations I've been working on for my personal startup. (Shameless plug:

                    </a>
                    )
                </p>
                <p>
                    How it works now is the script included in the GitHub allows users to take a folder full of their favorite family photos, and just like a digital photo frame, have their images scroll through. However those digital photo frames got a little bland after a while, what better way to spice them up then to show off your photos as if it was R2D2 delivering an important message.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I didn't hit too many surprising snags, but a lot of little OpenCV quirks that no matter how much time I spend with it, I'm always finding new things to go wrong. One bigger issue is I think I am much more comfortable sticking around with the software than actually having to measure and cut things.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The nice thing about this hack is that it feels pretty easily expandable. The things I'm planning on adding into this in the upcoming week, because turns out, holograms are cool and fun, are:
                </p>
                <p>
                    1) Allowing the screen to rest above (this is a really easy addition)
2) Allow for non-masked video display (also not hard, I just ran out of time and figured I'd leave my code in a usable state so others can have all the fun that I have had playing with these things.
3) I have some scrappy code for including masked animations/gifs, but the user facing aspect of that I'd have to work out a few more kinks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And then in the long term:
                </p>
                <p>
                    1) I've been working on some fun and different motion tracking/animation software and would love to be able to use this as a visualization tool for that.
2) Allow for other types of 2D Hologram types besides just pyramid shape.
3) I want to change the colormaps on fractals so that you can see fractal zoom projections as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All in all this was a blast and I hope other people can get some use out of it too.
                </p>
