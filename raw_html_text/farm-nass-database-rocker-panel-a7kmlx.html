                    InspirationThe Data I saw needed to be abridged and organized for a small device.  I reduced the data displayed to 5 columns: Location, year, commodity, yield/price/etc,and a smaller data_item.  While it doesn't use census data, I found survey data giving the most useful information and I was afraid that I would be mixing apples and oranges.  The data for year and location can be completely selected while other crop/stat type/etc can only chosen singly.  The best feature is that you qualify the yield/price/etc for finding highs lows or exactly.
