                    The inspiration for the web application comes from the issues stemming around the world. We are a world where people especially people we know, take advantage of the weak thinking it is their right to do so. With LifeLine, victims of abuse will be able to call 911 or any allotted emergency number without the abuser having a clue 911 is on the way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    LifeLine is built with Alexia which the victim calls Alexia with a secret message which sends it to Voiceflow and Twilio immediately calls 911. All of these are done without the abusers' knowledge.

                    We ran through a lot of roadblocks.

                        Trying to combine all the different frameworks to work together took a significant amount of time, but finally, in the last hours we figured it all out.

                        Understanding in what direction our project was going, and what we could accomplish in 36 hours on top of attending workshops.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to have a working project, and having established what features we could implement fully enough to make the project understand and enough to see where our vision was headed. We nearly scrapped this idea a fair number of times because we were not sure if we would ever figure out how to tie everything together, but with persistence (thank you Zixin and Jerry), we finally had a working viable model.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned a bit about how Alexa skills are actually programmed and the rules they have to follow. We also all used the Voiceflow API, Twilio and Firebase API for the first time. We learned how we worked together as a team and individually. We also indirectly learned project management, with trying to work on the project with members lost in workshops. The next step to LifeLine is to have an android and iOS app in order to give easier access and control to the users, and also possibly expand to cover other intimate situations to maximise the user's protection.
