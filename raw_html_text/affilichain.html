                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AffiliChain is inspired by the problem faced by one of our team members. He has been working as an affiliate marketer for a couple of years now, and has been feeling fed up from the industry's middlemen (transaction channels). Some of the main issues this industry faces are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Delayed payments (up to 120 days some times) and relatively big processing commissions through many channels
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Long verification process for user transactions
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Information differences between affiliators and sellers
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Those common issues that make it difficult to maintain a secure and positive cash flow for affiliate marketers, we want to solve them using BlockChain technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ** Affiliate marketing is the business of making money out of referring people to buy products through the product links posted by publishers or advertisers (see picture attached).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We disrupt affiliate marketing by manipulating BlockChain technology to ensure decentralized, traceable, and transparent transaction records as a B2B solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead of having many Dbs, each visible only for a certain company, there would be a single decentralized network, which tracks the whole user transaction process. Using this method, payment times can be reduced from months to days since there's no need to wait for information to move across many companies, as it would be transparent for everyone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, cutting middleman reduces the cost of tracking user transactions, therefore increasing profits both for affiliaters and sellers (such as Amazon).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Node.js, pure JS, and bootstrap to build the platform. The business logic (the underlying BlockChain technology) was implemented by us in JS as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are some BlockChain APIs, but they are designed mainly for Cryptocurrencies or Enterprises. Therefore, we implemented the protocol ourselves, creating a full functioning BlockChain platform, which enables a global chain network, p2p communication, and full transparency of transactions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Developing this platform was a big challenge, as it required us to fully understand BlockChain technology and how to manipulate it.  We certainly have learned a great deal out of it and we are grateful for the opportunity given through this hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for AffiliChain
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After iNTUition we plan to continue working on AffiliChain and develop our platform further by partnering with the prominent players of the affiliate marketing industry.
