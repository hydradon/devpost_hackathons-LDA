                    Inspiration - There are not many options available for finance and stock market education. We wanted to have an easy and accessible way to everyone to learn financial management and how to traverse the stock market using the Marvel universe for an engaging platform.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does - You are able to sell and buy stocks in the form of superhero and villain cards from the Marvel universe. The trends and popularity of each card will be available for the users to analyze and practice decision-making skills, and as your value increases you can spend the currency to expand your collection
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it - We used Bootstrap to style and customize the website while utilizing a dynamic php site to be able to update information in real-time. SQL is used for querying for the data in the Marvel API and we parse the JSON with Python. AWS is the service we are using to host the site and we use the Google Charts API for our data visualization.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into - Hosting services that did not support dynamically changing files was a major obstacle in our project.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of - Our website looks pretty. ;0
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned - We learned the difficulties of hosting a web service and the importance of proper planning and research.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Stock Marvel - The cards can then be expanded into an online trading card game where users can trade and compete with each other.
