                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all like to travel right ? But as lazy people, we don't want to compare hundreds of flights, and make a whole plan. We can focus on vacations only, and not planning anymore !
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From some basic informations (departure airport, budget and departure date), we will select for you a route at the best price possible (estimated). When you are satisfied with the result, ask for a precise route (price and times exact). You can even see you journey on a map !
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another feature : you can submit a picture link, corresponding to your ideal vacation, and it will analyse the picture to propose you a destination corresponding to the picture.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use a frontend composed of HTML, Vue.js, Javascript and flask. Then a Python algorithm is called in the background for the requests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Essentially optimizing the queries, as they might become really long.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The picture analysis was a big part of the work, and quite hard. Our frontend also makes us proud !
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to work with REST API (in Python), and improved our HTML/JS/Vue.js skills
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Skyscanner-CONpagnons
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are really looking forward to the next Hackaton, where we will take on another challenge.
