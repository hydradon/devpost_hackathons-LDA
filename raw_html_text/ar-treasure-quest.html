                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We love games - especially ones that we can win money on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's 3 clues placed in locations around your city - and a treasure chest. You find clues that lead to clues until you find the treasure chest, then you win $100! You have one hour to complete the treasure hunt!
                </p>
                <p>
                    You find the clues by holding up your phone and searching for them in AR.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity3D + ARKit2 + Firebase
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    XCode had to update to use ARKit2 and in order for XCode to update, I needed to update my OS, in order for my OS to update I needed to clean my SSD because I was out of space
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just placing an AR item in the world. I've never done anything with AR so it was exciting to get that working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A ton - ARKit is awesome.
                </p>
