                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Following the 2017 bull rub in crytocurrency markets I thought it would be a good idea to diversify my holdings into real world assets and that was the final step that made me go ahead and build what we have now because nothing existed on the market that allowed me to spend crypto on real estate in an efficient manner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It brings the home buying process in is entirety online.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project is still work in progress.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming across investors with expertise in the real estate sector.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have recently deployed our beta smart contract on the Ethereum testnet blockchain and the software is working just fine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We set out to build a demo from the beginning of year and we thought it would be done in a short space of time but each day we have come across something interesting to reiterate on.
                </p>

                    What's next for Property2chain
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the beta smart contracts done, we are now approaching title registries to try out the smart contract in a real world transaction
