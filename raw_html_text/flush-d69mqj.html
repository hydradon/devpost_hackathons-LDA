                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to get more productive with our time. As students, we spend a lot of time procrastinating and this app will help solve this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app automatically schedules tasks (which we call poops) for you so that you can get
                    <em>
                        shit
                    </em>
                    done.
It syncs with your google calendar and schedules tasks in your free time for the current day. The intention of this app is to learn your habits and schedule tasks in times that suit you.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used react-native to build the front end UI. We use many react-native libraries to improve the usability of the application.
We used feathersjs to create an API that supports Google OAuth and connects to a Postgres database
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For all of us, this is our first time using react-native, so it was a challenge to begin this project.
Working with react-native is very difficult as there isn't much support online and errors are more difficult to fix. Often the emulator or device stops connecting and we faced a lot of issues. (RIP)
Setting up Oauth for the API was also a challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our UI design as we put in a lot of effort into the appearance.
We are proud that we successfully finished the MVP project within the 24-hour time limit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about react-native, and we won't use or recommend it again for another project unless it has better support in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Flush
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we're planning on improving the machine learning aspect of the automatic scheduling so that it understands the user more and make smarter decisions.
We want to allow for users to subscribe to other people's schedules so that they can 'get shit done' together. Eg go  running or go to the gym together.
We also want to allow users to subscribe to celebrities to follow celebrity schedules. eg, follow a famous Youtuber's workout schedule.
