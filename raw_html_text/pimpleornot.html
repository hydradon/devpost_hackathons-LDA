                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes you see a boy and he's so cute you want to kiss him, and he says its just a little birth mole and you want to be sure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses ibm-watson and samsungs 5g network to quickly compare your image of a your bump to a vast array of pimples and helps inform your decision about the skin lump you are looking at.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with working through ibm-watson's visual recognition model, and a front end to allow users to upload images and compare them against ibms information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When working with machine learning tool, we had to upload images and identify pimples and other lip and face lumps. They are gross, so after getting past some of that we were rolling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We really were excited about finally having time to build an application and put it in an app store, but I just got overwhelmed and made a web application that was optimized for mobile devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Had a good idea that could hopefully help expand other practical applications of the technology, and help people say what they need to say.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work in a team,and IBM's cloud platform and all the ready made tools they have available for developers. Red hat looks very cool, as well as this visual learning tool, as always there is so much to explore and i am just excited.
                </p>

                    What's next for PimpleOrNot?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Develop an actual android application and move it into the samsung galaxy store, and maybe pair with outreach groups and dating apps, that could help raise awareness of this technology and help people talk about safe sex.
