                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Talking to a fellow citrus hacks participant about making something for fun on Unreal Engine 4.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right now the game on server is broken. But it is supposed to be a HTML5 game that people are able to play from any desktop web browser that supports HTML5. As well as being a Mega Man like game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The server I used EC2 and the amazon basic linux virtual server. Then put apache on it. Then just upload the HTML to it. It first at first but then just kept crashing. I built the actual game using Unreal Engine 4 on OS X.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to deploy it as a HTML5 game. Spent 5 hours trying to debug that, and got no where.
Had plans to deploy using AWS. Even got a sever running for it.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The glowing laser shots when you press space bar. Should check it out I think you will like it if you are on OS X since i couldn't not compile for windows.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How fun Unreal Engine can be and how i want to keep working in it. As well as how much i really don't like HTML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Unreal Engine Side Scroller
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will probably keep working out. Something fun to do on side I think. I would like to find a way to have it randomly generate new levels. As well as just have the whole side scroller amazing feel.

                <p>
                    If you have mac, you should try it out. Will post it on Google Dirve right now.

                <p>
                    Once again it will only work for macs, my apologies.
Really wanted to get it up on web server but just didn't pan out like I had planned.

                    EDIT: IMPORTANT If you do try out game to exit the game the command is hold "COMMAND" + "Q" to exit game.
