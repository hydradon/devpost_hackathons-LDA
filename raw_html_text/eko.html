                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To provide a mechanism for people to see the holistic costs of their investments

                <p>
                    A web service that scrapes through publicly available environmental practices of Fortune 500 companies and creates a ranking of environmental impact

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Python to collect and parse the data and then assigned each company a score from 1 to 10 based on the environmental impact data that they may or may not have provided. I then used python to convert the data into a form presentable on the web
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding publicly available data was a lot harder than I imagined. I was, however, able to find public data sets from a company called CDP. This was also a first time app design for all of the team members involved so a lot of us struggled with finding the next step in the design process, but it was very rewarding to get that experience and learn about the process hands on

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since this is our (everyone in my team's) first hackathon, I'm proud to have experienced the design process from start to (almost) finish, even if we weren't able to implement all of the functionality we wanted to
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned new things about scraping data from web sites, I got my first hands on experience with MySQL and PostgreSQL, I learned about the blockchain, I learned a lot about the design process from start to finish, and finally I learned what it feels like to be part of a team with the goal of making a product in mind, and it was really fun and rewarding

                    What's next for eko
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One thing we all are interested in implementing (and actually how this idea started in the first place) is making an environmentally conscious SIMS game. We could essentially use this as a template to demonstrate in an exaggerated manner the impact of these investments
