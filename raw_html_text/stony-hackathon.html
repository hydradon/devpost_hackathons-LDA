                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we heard that the topic for the hackathon was space, we all wanted to design something that involved protecting our planet and our brave astronauts. So the best way we thought to do that was by creating a game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our game involves moving a player in an orbit around the Earth and shooting rockets to destroy incoming asteroids and saving astronauts that are hurtling towards the Earth.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our game on NetBeans using JavaFX and CSS for design and made all our art using an online editor called piskel.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges we encountered include, making the player move in a circle around the planet and creating the path that the asteroids followed to reach the planet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making a functional video game in around 24 hours without using a gaming engine like Unity, but instead using JavaFX and creating our own engine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work together in a team and work under pressure to accomplish a goal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Stony-Hackathon
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope that hackathons here at Stony continue to happen so that we could go to more events and gain more experience.
