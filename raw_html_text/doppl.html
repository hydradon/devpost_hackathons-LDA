                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build something fun, simple, and complete. So we built Dappl!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simply type in a twitter handle and it will generate fake tweets sounding similar to that twitter user. The back end handles the complex markov chains used to generate seemingly human sentences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We worked collaboratively using tools such as flask, markovify, and tweepy (a python wrapper for twitter) to launch Dappl in just 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting our server, code, and website was quite the struggle, especially with our internet cutting out frequently. Luckily we didn't waste time and tested our code whenever possible. With only 24 hours to complete the project, our biggest challenge was the race against the clock.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We finished with an elegant and simple product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tasks take longer than you expect, even when you expect them to take a long time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Doppl
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We feel we left Doppl in a complete enough state, however there is some room for optimization. That being, said, we look forward to new and interesting web projects.
