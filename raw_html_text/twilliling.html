                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The reason we created this App is to to help out unemployed people get jobs through texting, making it easier, and it does not take a lot of space from your phone, which means less consumption on storage. It randomizes the list, meaning it changes the jobs on your list every time you look for more jobs, which gives you more opportunities. This is a way to get a job, simply by applying for the job you got from that list via texting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In general, replying back will give you a response to which our server will get the message and it will do it's thing by the orders you give him, simply it's gonna sort itself out just for you.
