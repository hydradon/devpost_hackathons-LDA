                    This project was inspired by Theresa Loong's research into a multi-platform interactive installation about how to raise awareness about domestic violence issues. Her installation examines relationships and domestic violence through the lens of objects - bought and broken.
Please check out this video for background into Theresa's project. [

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bought/Broken is a social-emotional learning Virtual Reality platform that helps a survivor of domestic violence reconcile with their traumatic past experiences. We envision that this tool could be used by a licensed psychologist or therapist to work with domestic violence survivors in their route to regaining their social-emotional confidence. This demonstration allows the VR user, which in this case, is the survivor of domestic violence, to practice techniques of transforming emotions into image motifs (such as in Visual Arts Therapy and Dialectical Behavior Therapy); and mindfulness meditation in a virtually created environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We decided to use VR, and more specifically the HTC Vive, for this project, because we wanted to execute the highest quality of user interactivity, full immersion and control of attention. We created a comfortable virtual environment with relaxing music and voiceover suggestions, where the user picks up broken pieces of a vase to mend it and then picks up a dead phone to give life to it. The lighting of the home also brightens as the user completes each &ldquo;mend&rdquo;/challenge, and these metaphors serve as a conversation-starter for guided self-healing, too.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We rendered our home environment on Unity, and used 3D objects/furniture from Wayfair and Unity's Asset Store. We created the interactions with the objects by programming in C# on Unity (eg. piecing together the broken vase, lighting up the iPhone). We also recorded our voiceover using omni-directional VR-specific sound equipment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments, Challenges and Lessons Learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time management and effective delegation of tasks is always a challenge. We managed to group sub-tasks based on skill and speed of learning so that everyone can do something that they are comfortable and learn new skills at the same time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Communication is also so important! Effective communication within the team, with the organizers and with the mentors all makes a project more fluid.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bought/Broken
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would love to test our prototype with domestic violence survivors, mental health professionals, psychologists, therapists and learning experience designers, who can give us best advice about the user experience and effectiveness of the product.
