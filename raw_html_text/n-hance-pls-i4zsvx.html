                    Neural networks make your smartphone videos better... after you've filmed them
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Motivation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Smartphones have gradually revolutionised the way in which we record our most important events---with camera setups that are now, at a glance, capable of rivalling bespoke cameras. This has made cameras one of the centerpiece features of smartphones.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, phone cameras are also bound to have deficiencies---arising from the constrained nature of squeezing them onto a mobile device. For example, they may not be able to handle a certain lighting setup properly, and result in over- or under-exposed photos and videos. These effects generally deteriorate as we move to the lower-end of the price spectrum.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While it may seem as if all is lost when a photo/video is taken under poor conditions,
                    <strong>
                        neural networks
                    </strong>
                    may be leveraged to remedy the situation---sometimes substantially. To demonstrate this, we present
                    <strong>
                        N-hance (pls)
                    </strong>
                    , (to the best of our knowledge) the first enhancing system for smartphone videos.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Key results
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Here we make use of the latest advances in enhancing smartphone photos through deep learning, and build up on them to create a viable
                    <strong>
                        smartphone video enhancer
                    </strong>
                    . By doing so, we demonstrate:

                        of the photo enhancement model into the video domain, requiring
                        <em>
                            negligible post-processing
                        </em>

                        </em>
                        of the input distribution the model was trained on---namely, on
                        <em>
                            night-time recordings
                        </em>
                        ;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Applicability of fine-tuning a model pre-trained on a particular device to expand to another.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    All of these features make our prototype a solid indicator of a potentially important future application area, providing a cost-effective way to obtain enhanced video recordings.

                    With minimal fine-tuning (in TensorFlow) of a pre-trained model for iPhone 3GS photos, we have been able to obtain a viable enhancer for the iPhone 5 (deliberately selected here to emphasise the potential of enhancement). From here, creating a video enhancer boiled down to extracting the frames from the input (by using
                    <em>
                        scikit-video
                    </em>
                    ) and processing them individually using the photo enhancer---
                    <em>
                        minimal postprocessing
                    </em>
                    was necessary to create a coherent and useful output. We further extended the original enhancer network to support
                    <em>
                        batched inference
                    </em>
                    , speeding up the video processing by a factor of four.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most surprisingly, we have found that the model fares well even when faced with inputs that drastically differ from the ones it was trained on---namely, the model provides a good level of enhancement on most
                    <em>
                        night-time

                    By leveraging a Flask server and an Azure instance, we have exposed a clear interface for submitting new videos to be processed, as well as analysing and downloading the results.

                <p>
                    Having demonstrated that a photo enhancer can be feasibly generalised to videos---even ones taken outside of the training distribution---we believe that this exposes clear potential for a robust mobile application; one that we hope to explore in the coming months.
