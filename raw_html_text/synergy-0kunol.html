                    It all started when Adam and I were sitting at our seats at Bitcamp. We needed inspiration, and so we embarked on a spiritual journey.The sabbatical we went on taught us all we needed to learn to win Bitcamp, I personally will never forget the amazing lessons and visions we saw. Adam almost died, it was crazy. But then, we had all we needed for the project. From then on, Adam and I toiled for 36 hours straight, with absolutely no breaks, to bring the world SYNERGY.  With SYNERGY, anyone can quantify another's "hot-or-not" classification, with no troubles or worries.

                    Adam and I faced a variety of complications and tribulations on our journey. Firstly, and mainly, traitors on the team. We originally began with four team members but pretty soon that number dwindled to two. And yet, we progressed with unprecedented growth once the team became just Adam and I: we know who was implementing actual work. I don't want to say anything bad about the betrayers, but the knife they stuck in our backs hurt with an unimaginable pain I've never felt before. Yet, on one hand I cannot feel too saddened, as we reached heights never before thought possible. Truly, our ex-teammates were dead-weight. I'm glad they're gone, honestly. I only cried for a little long time when they disappeared. Boy, that in itself was a whole story for another time.

                    All right, let me get into the story. It all started when Adam and I and the others (who will not be named here on out [Natalie and Ronaldo, if you were curious]), arrived at Bitcamp. Almost immediately, I could tell Adam and I shared an impenetrable connection of programming and coding and improving society in general. However, the others seemed like they were only present for the free swag. In fact, they swindled another shirt from the Facebook booth when they were supposed to get only one color. They deprived the other hackermen from receiving those shirts. Disgusting, I know. That's why we subsequently kicked them off our group and reported them to the police, as standard Bitcamp protocol demands.

                    Imagine my face when SEAL TEAM SIX arrived. Boy, was I blown. Anyway, they tried to kill Natalie and Ronaldo, but we heroically stopped them with our ultimate masculinity. Fortunately, they died. Oh well, we used their sacrifice to construct our masterpiece, the savior of humanity, SYNERGY. We will not stop until their memories' are avenged, and we have SYNERGY everywhere.

                    What is the future of SYNERGY? We're going global, of course. Soon, SYNERGY will be available to any consumer anywhere, letting anybody measure beauty objectively. Never fear about a person's looks ever again, we have you covered (scientifically).
