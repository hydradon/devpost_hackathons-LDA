                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted users to have a fun experience with something they wouldn't normally here about, their "past" life and "who they will be in the future".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The skill asks you a series of yes or no questions that either determine your past life or future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built this using the Amazon Developer Skills kit, googling, and Storyline.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges I ran into was getting Alexa's voice to enunciate certain words to make it seem more funny or sad. If I had more time I would've used the Speech Synthesis Markup Language throughout the language more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud the final project turned out to be working and gets to the essence of what I was going for! It was very fun to build and surprisingly challenging at the same time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use Speech Synthesis Markup Language strategically and how to code some intents. AWS is very difficult to work with in my opinion but Youtube and Google really helped me out a lot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for AlternativeLife
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I don't think I will upload it to the Alexa Store but I would like to create more skills for more users to enjoy and maybe create some highly useful ones too, we'll have to see what I get into!
