                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As CS students, we are constantly bombarded by requests for help on somebody's entrepreneurial idea, help code people's websites, or just work for people short-term so we can help them flesh out their ideas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With such as huge demand, there must be a way for students to filter out those contract hire requests that are good, and only connect with those that they are genuinely interested in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tinder, but one one side you have students and on the other you have contract employers or hires. If both swipe right, each party will receive the other's contact info. Otherwise, contact information is kept private and hidden, removing unwanted interaction.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    NodeJS and MongoDB are inherently difficult to understand with their extreme abstractions and callbacks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A working UI and backend in the duration of the hackathon. A semi-unique logo :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TONS of people are working to connect ideas and students/hackers. Amidst all these ideas, we hope to target a specific audience of CS Students and short-term contractors(e.g small companies, research groups, entrepreneurs). There are a lot of potential solutions, but none that use this model.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for gigSwipe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next up, we hope to send out invites to companies and students that worked closely with our idea to shape its features. Listening attentively and iterating. We're just a team trying to apply a dating-genre of apps to a serious context, in hopes of making it more engaging and fun for both companies and students.
