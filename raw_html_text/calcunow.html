                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspiration for CalcuNow came from Edward's annual high school magnet project where one has to sketch a picture (usually a cartoon-ish picture) onto a graph paper, plot the points and make equations for all the lines, then input those equations along with other parameters to re-create the picture onto a computer program, usually Winplot or Geogebra. So this app will help cut the time for the project drastically.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes in point coordinates, for x,y,h,and k-since most of the equations are in their standard form. Then calculates all necessary numbers to create an equation for the points. This equation is then printed out onto the screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to build the program and all its functions and used a Samsung Galaxy running Android 6.01 Marshmallow to test and run CalcuNow.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neither of us have developed any apps or used Android Studio prior to this experience, so many of our bugs and errors had to be fixed using our experience with Java and C++ and with major help from the Internet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully were able to create a fairly simple app that can calculate and print out the equations for a point-slope formula, the standard form of a parabola, and both the standard and parametric forms of the equation of a circle.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that creating a simple interface can be fairly complex and become confusing really fast.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CalcuNow
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to add an equation database for subject like Physics, Chemistry, and adding other mathematical equations to be solved for. Another feature we plan on adding is finding other information about the equations, such as the roots for a quadratic equation.
