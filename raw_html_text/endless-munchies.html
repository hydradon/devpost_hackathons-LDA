                    Users need to plan ahead around their desires for weed and their cravings for food and munchies. After smoking, individuals are forced to think hard about their munchies options and coordinate around food options. Our service lets you connect to Weedmaps

                        Weedmaps has a very difficult API, and it's competitors Leafly and Cannabis reports are either closed or empty. This is obviously discounting all of the illegal purchases that are made without registered dealers.
