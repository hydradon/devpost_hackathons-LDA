                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're thinking that this concept could be useful for students learning the basics of chemistry, be an opportunity to incorporate technology into chemistry textbooks, and provide a more accessible option compared to the expensive chemistry model kits.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application allows someone using their phone to scan certain QR codes and see a 3D representation on a particular chemical formula in augmented reality.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was built using Android Studio alongside Java and ARCore SDK. We used Google ARCore's sample project to help us set up our activity, nodes, and fragments class for our code. That sample project enabled us to figure out how to scan an image, and display a 3D model with AR. It helped us understand how to change camera views once the camera detected and image.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many tutorials focused more on the Unity environment so finding useful examples was a bit tricky. Also, it was tough getting used to how the file structure should be for an AR game.
