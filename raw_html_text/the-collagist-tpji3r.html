                    The application that we have named The Collagist came about from a simple need of storing memories and moments.  From this concept we expanded the idea to be versatile for friends &amp; families to utilize.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The collagist allows you to share your photos that are categorized by themes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another feature of the Collagist is the privacy of your images.
When creating a theme you have the option to make it public or private.
Private themes are exclusive to you at first and can be shared at your discretion. 
By sharing your theme you allow your friends to view or add to your collage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you decide to create a public theme. Then its accessible to everyone (including non-memebers of the site).
Your friends can still drop photos into your public theme. Public themes will display the earth icon to indicate public to the world.
View the link below to see a public theme example.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We knew the UI would be the most challenging so we spent most of our time trying to come up with a fluid process. Currently the application is supported by desktop browsers. If the public likes this idea we would like to expand to mobile
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to define hard rules. Example should you be able to control another user photos if your not the author of that theme? The answer to that is no, but we needed to answer hard questions and designs like this to make it easier for our development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Love hackathons and we hope to improve our coding skills more and more
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to find your niche with your application. As technology innovates so many people getting into development. We tried to create a social media site that allows you to socialize, remain private, and go beyond the normal picture messaging. We hope the public likes the order of images, because we believe sometimes you need more pictures and ordered to tell a better story.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Collagist
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully moving to mobile and improving the UI. The site was developed by 2 full time workers. We would like to get more people on the team.
