Coupled with the high unemployment rate in the country, we want to build a workforce and a system that will strategically reduce the unemployment rate, bring more prestige to blue collar jobs and address the level of competency for the workplace thereby solving,

                <p>
                    IGofer is an intermediary between clients and skilled and unskilled labour/artisans, so we are the third insured party that provides security and builds trust towards anything our clients wants to do. We are working with an Andela or Uber Onboarding model for staffs which clears doubts and builds trust, technological Advantage, Customer Support, affordable charges not minding the location and a student work scheme that will encourage undergraduate students to work part time as they study, our business model is different because we are using an onboarding recruitment scheme that places a lot of check and entails detailed vetting and monitoring, partnership with credible organisation will help us to build trust and have access to our customers homes and offices. An advantage for the networked artisan services is that it is not just a freelancing platform but it is structured to have a workforce with equal cash flow and jobs among its members and partners. Our roadmap includes integrating USSD, Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality and Blockchain Technology to our technical setup. Beyond the technological aspect, offline and mortar shops are also looked at for as many that are not used to its operation.
