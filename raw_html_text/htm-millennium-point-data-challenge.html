                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for this project was to be able to represent the data available to us visually so it was easier for users to see and understand, and add interactivity for the user when analysing the data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project visualises the Millennium Point data using a 3d space created in Unity. The user has the ability to move between the three main floors of the millennium point building to see the number of people using each entrance on each floor. The number of people entering is visualised through a circle that expands when more people enter through that entrance. The program also displays if the day or week is a school holiday, an event or during BCU term time. Averages of the people entering is also shown by Day and by week.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First we formatted the given data so that it could be loaded into unity. Next we sourced the floor plans for the building to locate the entrances for use in the product. We then created the UI plan and the 3D world to represent the data we were given.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Will only run on 64 Bit windows, can be recompiled for any OS if desired*
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenges we encountered were parsing the original data given for the challenge because the data was not always in a consistent format which could be passed easily for use in the unity engine. Labelling the entrances also proved a challenge as some were not clear to see and were not labelled on the floor plan. Creating a GUI similar to the design of Millennium Point also proved a challenge but we created one by comparing the GUI to documents and the Millennium point website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through the project we were able to create a project that was aesthetically pleasing for the general public but also could be used to display information throughout the year for the different entrances to the building. We are also proud of using game engine technology to visual data to large audiences with data analysing capabilities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt time management skill, delegation of responsibility to maximise the resources available. We also learnt more about using Unity3D and programming in C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HTM Millennium Point Data Challenge
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To improve the project for future use we would let it accept more general data files, to accept custom data which we could not do due to the time constraints of the project. We would also implement more advanced data analysis to provide details of trends over time.
