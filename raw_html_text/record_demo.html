                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team member wants to listen to his beautiful voice, so we decide to develop a app with similar function.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app has a function to record and play the voice of the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Xcode. We design the UI and connect to ViewController.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are totally new in Swift4. And we learn it and build the project. From nothing to something. 
Like, We don't know how to implement the save function for the record.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My teammate is very very satisfied that his voice can record and have fun on it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teamwork. We know that we can save a lot of time by working with others. Also, we can get a lot of inspiration from our teammates.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for record_demo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will try to implement the save function, and add more function on it. 
We can do the random generator of text. 
We can add the demo recording. 
We try to implement a database to connect with our app. So that we can save a lot of audio in our phone.
