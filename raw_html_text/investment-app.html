                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During our exchange semester in Vienna we had a lengthy discussion that it is hard for young people to invest. Additionally we were wondering how can we invest in the long term, as very uncertain times are ahead. For that reason we wanted to tackle this challenge at the HackJunction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For that circumstance we created a challenge:
                    <strong>
                        "How can we personalise investments and inspire young people to save and invest money in a sustainable manner?"
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    So we created an app that helps people to see the benefits and risk involved in investing. Our goal was to make investing accessible to everyone.

                <p>
                    Based on the Open Banking API, the investment preferences and goals of the client it generates an investment portfolio. This construction is done through an AI which finds the best combination of the three mentioned categories. The client then has the possible to adjust the proposed portfolio and then invest in this. At the same time this investment is an opportunity for the bank to provide the platform

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built web app using Angular 5 (frontend) and Dotnet core backend. The whole system is currently compatible with Nordea Open Banking API.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to change some features as we run out of time and technologies we chose did not offer the features we had imaged to use. In the beginning we run into some hickups getting the provided API working, this is due the urge to be quick.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the end we created quite nice scalable web app which offers a nice overview of learning the risks and benefits of investing. Additionally we were able to connect to third party services. We are proud to work in an international team.

                <p>
                    We learned that coding can be really exhausting when you have very limited time and too many crazy ideas.
