                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the recent outbreak of the coronavirus, we wanted to make a platform that would inform people about actual incidents around them. We wanted to create an application that would gather crowdsourcing information and show people what is going on around them, such as an emergency event or free food.
Helps in avoiding delays caused in emergency situations, like wildfires spreading to localities, potential shooter in an area etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gathers events reported by users (crowdsourcing) and shows it on the application, also notifying users in that area about what is happening. Users can post events as well as up-vote or down-vote events.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app tackles two environments for instance , if it is an emergency, users in a particular geo-fence are notified. The delay caused by mass emails and safety procedures in place today. Another instance, is just community events, where people can up-vote particular events and notify others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build the front end using javascript and HTML. For the back end we used Flask. For database we should mysql. Google cloud platform was used to integrate the code and set up a database and server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We weren't familiar with JavaScript so we had to learn it from scratch and apply it. We also encountered some problems with the jQquery requests. We faced many problems while integrating front-end and back end, handling POST and GET requests. We learned through our mentors and successfully overcame our challenges.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have an actual front end GUI and the front-end and back-end can connect properly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned Javascript, Flask, google cloud platform and how to debug several problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Krowd
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we will send text updates on events to users who subscribed to our services and is in a certain GeoFence.  Potentially using Twilio to trigger notifications to our subscribers.
