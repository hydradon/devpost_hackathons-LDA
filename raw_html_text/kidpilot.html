                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    KidPilot was inspired just by watching how difficult it is for parents to walk around the airport with their kids; oftentimes, they're lugging around strollers and a lot of baggage, all while keeping tracking of bouncing and running children.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    KidPilot is a game where parents can prepare their kids for their flight by running around the airport and taking pictures of everything they find! Backed by user research, KidPilot targets parents' pain points in traveling with small children: getting around the airport with a lot of luggage, squirmy children on flights, a need for educating their kids on flight etiquette, and a way to get them off a screen by engaging with KidPilot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    KidPilot engages kids by sending them on a scavenger hunt for objects and places you'd typically find in an airport: restaurants, suitcases, water fountains, security lines. The pressure is on with a timer that, when it runs out, ends the game. The length of the game is tailored to how long the layover is. If kids complete the scavenger hunt before the layover is over, they can win cool prizes!
                </p>
                <p>
                    KidPilot also makes sure to educate on flight etiquette: how to act when in line, how to act if people are sleeping in the plane, all the things may not be second nature to kids.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At this point in time, KidPilot's wireframes were built in Sketch. The backend for this application has not been hardcoded, but I've built a Python demo for how XapiX could interact with Airberlin and Google's API. You can find it

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to balance who my users were, and how I could help solve their pain points. I interviewed people who weren't necessarily my target users, and did heavy brainstorming into what my own pain points were as a young person traveling abroad. In the end, I realized that applications could only go so far into aiding the user, as no application could fix the airport experience as a whole. I decided to pivot completely, scrap my existing wireframes, and focus on a smaller group of users. From there, I was better able to understand and build around my users' needs due to more focus and less use cases.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As an avid hackathon attendee, I was really excited to employ the design process into this project. I have learned how important design is to making software, so I decided to go all in in the process. I also learned how to make design mockups for the first time, so understanding how to use the Sketch application was a personal goal hit for me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've learned that in building fast, it's easy to make a lot of assumptions about what the user wants. By implementing a process of constant iteration and frequent feedback from stakeholders and users, the project is better built for the user and what their needs are.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for kidpilot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Possible additions to Airberlin's API could significantly improve KidPilot experience. API fields such as seeing who is playing at any given time could allow for the use of teams, landmarks could improve the educational experience, help desk locations in every airport could improve safety of small children in airports, and cabin type to tailor the users' experience could improve the personal feel of KidPilot.
