                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The prevalence of fake news is everywhere.  The goal of this app was to provide a way for people to easily get aggregated statistics about authors, domains and articles to more easily get a understanding of the trends that authors and domains have.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app uses a nodejs server with REST apis.  It provides a way for people to create users, store articles, and add tags to the articles.  These tags get applied to each author and can in turn be retrieved for each domain.  There is also a feature called SNR (signal to noise ratio) in each author.  This is designed to filter out how often each tag they get attributed with turns out to be true.  This provides the balance between people being trolls on the internet and people who are genuinely trying to help.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By first building the models and designing how they were going to interact with each other.  once that was done we started designing and implementing the interaction logic that controlled how they worked together.  That is the part that makes the whole thing tick.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Asynchronous calls.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building the algorithm that creates the links between the objects.  That is the brains of the entire app and lets everything work the way that it was intended.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That front ends are much harder to build than we anticipated

                <p>
                    Depending on the reaction at this hackathon, it might be something that gets refined and eventually put into production.  It is that or it just sits in a repo.
