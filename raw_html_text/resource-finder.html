                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Around 9 million people die of hunger and hunger-related diseases every year, more than the lives taken by AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined. We thought we were really fortunate to have these resources, and wanted to share these facilities with everyone else on Earth.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It looks at images from satellite to find places where a certain resource is in abundance, so that it helps non-profit organizations to spread these resources to people who do not have them. Furthermore, it tells farmers and fishermen etc. where there is an excess of a certain resource, so that they can obtain what they need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Google Earth Engine API to get the images from satellite and analyze the images. We used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make a website conveying the information found before. We also used the Google Cloud Maps API to get a map of the place examined.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Obtaining the images from satellites and analyzing them. 
Adding Markers to the Google Map
Lack of teammates with experience + one of our teammate ended up in the ER.

                    Getting a Google Map on a website and making it look good.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google Cloud, Google Cloud Maps API and Google Earth Engine API. Also a bit of HTML and JavaScript.

                    What's next for Resource Finder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improve on the analyzer of the images. Also add markers on the map, and try to make the map more pinpointed and accurate so that it gives the exact location. Also, use a natural disaster predictor and try to merge the two maps etc to make it more convenient.
