                    The proliferation of "Fake News," and ignorance of individuals on current events has been on the rise in recent years. Our web application is meant to combat this fact and help bring neutral, unbiased articles to better inform the general public

                <p>
                    Our application analyzes a url for bias using Google's Semantic Analysis while also providing a short summary, author, and date of publish all on one page for the user. Furthermore, our application offers suggestions on articles with a similar topic while also displaying their reliability according to their bias.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program's back end is written in python3. We divided the project into 2 tasks. We had two developers work on the back end collaborating through github and one front end developer using CSS, HTML5, and Javascript. To move the back end to the front end, we packaged the python code with Flask to enable HTTP requests between the two.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our original plan was to have the front end built with Ember.js however that plan fell through as we had trouble setting up the environment and using their open source UI library. Another issue was that we planned to host the website on the google cloud, however we ran into multiple obstacles that prevented us from deploying our web app. We combated these problems by quickly picking up bootstrap and migrating the application to a local host.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we were three underclassman, participating in our first hackathon, and were able to reach out of our comfort zone and create a web application that made us learn new, unplanned for concepts. Moreover, we were able to face obstacles and challenges that we could have never have foreseen and come up with quick, efficient solutions that aptly solved our problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that sometimes you are forced to try and learn something new under a very strict time constraint. We learned that things can and will go wrong. But moreover, we learned that we are able to handle these challenges with the company of our friends and derive solutions that result in us continuously growing as better programmers.

                    What's next for WTFthisarticle
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WTFthisarticle plans on becoming even easier to use as we plan on making it a Chrome Extension that will always be in reach. Moreover, we plan on migrating the whole system to the cloud. Lastly, we can extend this idea to reach any type of media and incorporate better NLP strategies with our own written ML algorithms.
