                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by the Alexa tech for good challenge, seeing that STEM was one of the topics, I decided to create a trivia game about it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Quite simple, the skill asks the user 5 questions related to STEM, the user has to say the number of what they think the correct answer is. If they got it right, they get 1 point, if not, Alexa will tell them what the correct answer is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on some of templates available on Alexa's github repo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding questions that are not too easy and pass the "one breath" test.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    Creating a skill for the first time! (I'm not a software developer)
                </p>
                <h2>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding more questions, and perhaps raising the number of questions in a each game from 5 to 7 or 10, depending on user feedback.
