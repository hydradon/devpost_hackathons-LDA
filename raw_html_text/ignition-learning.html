                    The issue that we are addressing is that studying habits are generally not efficient. Traditional classroom styles and lectures are not intuitive for many types of learners. We are creating an application that is conducive to many types of students, by engaging visual, auditory, and kinesthetic learners.

                    Ignition learning is an education application that uses a speech to text api to compile lecture notes. Google's natural language processing API allows us to parse through the lecture notes and extract the key words that important in that lecture, as well as the category type (Location, Person, Event, etc.) From the important concepts and types, questions are generated and are available to the student to consider and answer.

                    In the future, we hope to finalize our web application and create an iOS app for students. We hope to tailor lecture notes and quizzes to the students understanding, and produce quizzes at periodic intervals for active recall learning.
