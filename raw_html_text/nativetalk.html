                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During our own experience while texting to some foreign friend, it will be inconvenient if we need to frequently look up the expressions and then copy paste to the text field. The limited number of language that we can type also restricts our communication somehow since it is almost impossible to have various keyboards ready before hand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app serves as the bridge of communication between users when they are texting with each other in different languages. Users can send and receive the text messages in their own language and no matter what language others are using.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized the Twilio API to build a server which lets a Twilio phone number connect any phone numbers and also get the message body. After that, we parse the message and then send it to Google translate API. After getting the result in form of JSON, we send to translated text message to the receiver.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) learning about Twilio API, 2) correctly using Google-Translate API, 3) converting HTML entities to unicode
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are so proud of our idea. This great app breaks the language barriers among people all over the world and can be broadly applied in various fields such as international trading, business cooperation and making new friends from different countries. We are also lucky to use the most advanced APIs provided by Twilio and Google and to successfully accomplish the whole project on time and of good quality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about how we can use Twilio API, ngrok and Flask to build a server that can support communication between phones. We also learned how to parse the text messages and send them to Google translation by protocol and get the translated messages and send them back.
                </p>

                    What's next for NativeTalk
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to build a database that can record all users' native languages as they register for our app service, and their Twilio numbers that users buy to maintain a well-established user library that supports our app and boost the communications all over the world!
