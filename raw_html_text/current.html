                    How we built it
                </h2>

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Saving data from forms so that user could put in preferences and the app would better know what to suggest.
                </p>

                    Successfully implementing the weather API.

                <h2>

                <p>
                    Working on saving data from the forms so that the app can know where the user lives. We would also want to give the user the ability to import photos of their closet so that the suggestions would be tailored to clothes that the user has.
