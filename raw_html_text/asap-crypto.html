                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've always been pretty interested with cryptography, but I never really had too many projects to work on. A while a ago I learned about "Homomorphic Encryption". The idea is you can encrypt values and do calculations with these values producing an encrypted answer. I knew I wanted to use this technology instantly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes simple JavaScript math code, translates it by replacing computational syntax with Encrypted Homomorphic functions, and then preforms the calculations on an "unsecured" system. The encrypted outputs from the "insecure" system are then transmitted back to the "secure" system where the result of the calculations is decrypted. This is done by generating a public and private encryption key.  Only the private encryption key is used for revealing the true message. It also demonstrates a sample application of a calculator where all calculations are handled in an insecure location yet is still secure
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this by using node and socket.io for data transfer over the web. I used c++ and HElib for the encryption, and python for interacting with the c++ scripts from node.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Homomorphic encryption is very complex. One challenge was the massive learning curve. Also working with libraries between different languages was be quiet challenging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of having a simple interpreter for turning normal JavaScript math scripts into scripts that work for encrypted calculations. Also I am proud of preforming completely secure communications on insecure nodes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about Homomorphic encryption as well a gained a better understanding of working with c++
                </p>

                    What's next for Asap Crypto
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What's next for Asap Crypto is a better interpreter that works with constants, strings, and other variable types. I would also like to add bitcoin transactions between the 3rd party computers and the people who submit the creates.
