                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're all three freshmen right now with a growing yet limited knowledge of coding. We wanted to branch out a little bit at RevolutionUC, so we decided that we wanted to take advantage of the 24 hours and learn HTML and website design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program/website runs a variety of mini-programs that run amusing functions that do absolutely nothing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started off writing our functions in C++, a language that we are all familiar with, then we researched how we can translate that into JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Going into this, none of us knew anything about how to design a website. We struggled with doing simple things and it felt like we were getting hurdle after hurdle thrown at us.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're very proud of what we've accomplished here. We have learned the basics of two different new languages that can be used in nearly any future profession.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've learned how to do basics in HTML formatting, JavaScript, and how to style using CSS
