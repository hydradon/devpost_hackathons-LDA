                    Due to other commitments, I was only able to come to the hackathon for ~6 hours total.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I spent 3 hours on Sunday working on a app that scans barcodes to tell you whether you already own a movie.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then I went to a surf carnival
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then I went to sleep
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then I woke up
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then I did a bronze medallion course
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then I came back to the Hackathon and made this.
                </p>

                    I followed this tutorial:

                    </a>
                    and made a quite a few modifications. This was my first time using love and it was actually really fun.
