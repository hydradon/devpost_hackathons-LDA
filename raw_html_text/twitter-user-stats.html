                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were interested in working with the Twitter API, and thought it would be really interesting to see some general stats about certain profiles.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program analyzes a given user profile's page and calculates interesting stats. For example, their most popular tweets and most popular followers

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python as a back end, taking advantage of Tweepy and the Twitter API. From there, we used Flask to integrate our Python with the front end, which was comprised of HTML and JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to use the Twitter API at first was confusing at first. We spent a lot of time looking at references to see what we could do with it. Also, We ran into problems with connecting the front end HTML files and the back end Python code. We eventually settled on using Flask which is a Python based code that allows a seamless integration between Python code and HTML basics. We had to make some compromises due to time and lack of experience, including not doing embedded tweets, but we believe it turned out pretty well.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our entire team's first hackathon, so we are really proud of how our project ended up with this in consideration. It was Jacob's first major program in python, and his first time ever using an API. Dylan and Connor are really proud of figuring out how to take Jacob's back end and connect it to a front end, as they have never done this before either.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Twitter API, front end back end connection, and how fun hackathons are!

                <h2>
                    What's next for Twitter User Stats
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will probably work on minor improvements from here, possibly running outside of flask so that others can use the service by using an online server instead of a local one. Also, if we can figure out embedded tweets that would be great.
