                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Eco-friendly smart home inspired by our lunch containers.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It has touch sensors to turn off the pervious room's lights and turn on the lights in the room you enter. This will help save electricity, simulating the effect of a truly SmartHome setup.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Utilized trash from lunch to create housing, and integrated hardware and software knowledge to create a basic model SmartHome using LEDs, buttons, and touch sensors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hardware compatibility, attempting to upscale, trying to use a Dragonboard for the first time. Most of the challenges came from trying to overcomplicate the project.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Don't get ahead of the design. Do thing incrementally, have a small team.
