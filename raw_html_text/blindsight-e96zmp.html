                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are a lot of things we do in our lives that rely on our eyes, especially as programmers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It came as a surprise to see a blind student in our classes. As much as companies and schools try to help people with disabilities, they have limited staff and resources.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When we learned about the City of Mississauga's Smart Cities initiative at PC Hacks, we thought of a way to make the project be more accessible and inclusive.

                <p>
                    We have developed an assistive technology application to help the visually impaired through live remote assistance from their mobile device called
                    <em>
                        BlindSight
                    </em>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Volunteers can
                    <em>
                        help the visually impaired enhance their daily lifestyle
                    </em>
                    by allowing them to be more independent. Routine tasks like reading medicine bottle labels, navigating commute to and from work are more difficult to accomplish with limited vision.
