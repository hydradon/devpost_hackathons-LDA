                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Minion is for all electricity consumers across the world to help reduce their power costs at an affordable price point using "user friendly" products &amp; analysis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As there are many IOT Smart Energy Devices in the market that ensures energy efficiency and cost saving but it makes monthly electric bills doubling or tripling every month, with no increase in energy usage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We had carefully read solutions of all existing smart meters across the world and identified the perfect use case which ensures 100% energy efficiency and cost saving to the electricity consumers
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Minion is a single device (size: 39x49 Millimeter - World's smallest pocket energy auditor) with Wi-Fi,LORA,3G,4G,5G Connectivity which will fit inside the breaker panel (next to utility meter like addon) with single sensor clamp connection after the utility meter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This Minion will perform appliance/device/tool/equipment wise real-time energy analytics. It will also perform Predictive analytics &amp; maintenance of assets (Hospital, Industrial, Manufacturing/factories, Hospitality, Retail) which rescues the high cost assets from breakdown and also lowers the insurance costs. It schedules maintenance which will ensure and extend the life-time of assets beyond insurance time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our Minion is also Solar friendly/compatible. It has the ability to measure generation and consumption readings (acts as net meter) and performs real time &amp; predictive analytics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All the analytics are done on the cloud and enable users to experience the results through our SaaS - Windows application, Android &amp; IoS Apps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our Minion provides three steps for ensuring 100% energy efficiency and cost saving

                        <p>
                            Predictive analytics - Reduces surprises in energy bills and User's can easily predict the energy usage and bills and schedule accordingly. This would be very useful for sectors running high cost assets which will prevent from breakdown and increase the efficiency of the assets.
