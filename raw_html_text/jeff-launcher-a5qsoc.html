                    Inspiration &amp; ## What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted something that would integrate web searches and video playback into an application launcher.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML to bring text, Javascript and CSS to give Jeff-Launcher animations and colours and Electron as a platform to use those langues and developer front-end. We also used Cmake and C++ to develop our back-end. Altogether, these languages and platforms allowed us to create a great UX and UI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the challenges we ran into include using C++ in MacOS. We found difficulties in creating functions that would comply with the OS, but were able to find solutions to all of our issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a final product that simplifies a user's life, by allowing them to multitask and find their apps, videos, music, and documents easily.  This includes allowing the youtube player window to act as a widget, creating animated search bars, developing a strong back-end and a front-end that is simple and pleasing to the eye.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Electron, Cmake, and more! Some of these languages were new to some of us and others had previous experience in it. Therefore, as a group we developed our understanding and knowedge of these platforms and languages. We also learned to work as a team and allocate work efficiently and effectively.
