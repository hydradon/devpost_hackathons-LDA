                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Formed at the intersection of different platforms, we hoped to utilize present utilities and services to empower the average user with a more powerful integration between phone, cloud, and email
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It comprises of 5 activities. The first one being a utility which sends calls the user as a notification specific to the user's keyword in the subject of the email.The second being a utility which sends the user a notification via SMS specific to the user's keyword in the subject of the email. The third utility allows the user to search their Box storage to retrieve the requested file and add it to their email as an attachment within seconds. A fourth utility is an email command which allows the user to send the email as an SMS to any requested number. The last but not least utility searches through the list of hackathons in 2017 and allows the user to send a specific hackathon's details to another user within seconds.
