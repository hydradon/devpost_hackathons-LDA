                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Knowing how important education is, and how children are more motivated by what interests them and what makes them happy, we were inspired to create an application where children could learn while having fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an interactive web application with questions covering various subjects such as general knowledge, science, and mathematics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Visual Studio as well as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create the web application, and we used Adobe Photoshop to design the logo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A problem we ran into was having to completely change our idea halfway due to incompatibility with different Unity versions for the AR Foundation image tracking. Another problem we encountered was to insert an image along with our questions and try to keep track of a score with the limited time we had left.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to have thought of back-up plans beforehand and immediately divided up the tasks amongst ourselves for the new project when we had to recognize that it was time for us to give up on the main idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use different programs together such as JavaScript for some of us, Adobe Photoshop for others and GitHub for all of us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bee-Smart
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to incorporate images with each question, add more categories and more specific questions as well as implement a score tracker.
