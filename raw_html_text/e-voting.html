                    Cape Town is a very beautiful place with its mountains, great sunset beaches and the calm vibe among its community members which always makes tourist feel welcomed. But apart from that its rich in a lot of history that is embedded around the city and its ocean. One of these histories is in he Robben Island where majority of the political icons of this beautiful country where kept during apartheid. Being 25 years after democracy, and the our elections coming in the next 2 weeks we felt there is no better way to commemorate those we lost during the struggle and appreciate the opportunity to find ourselves in spaces where we could engage in global topics than building a Dapp that would  give its people the real democracy to vote without favor or fear

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Dapp authenticates users using their id, then they can cast their vote of which will be counted and the list of winning parties and the areas at which they got most votes can me displayed. It keeps the identity of the user anonymous and  cannot be revealed.
