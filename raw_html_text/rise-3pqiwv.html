                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a way to gain immediate satisfaction from academic achievement, and use it to encourage students to perform better.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rise analyzes your grades using the APIs of an LMS (currently using a dummy LMS created specifically for Rise) and computes a score based on improvements and academic success. In addition, it allows you to challenge your friends in a non-harmful manner, and allows the teacher to create rewards for students who meet certain goals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used React Native, Python, and Node.JS with Express as a web framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to cut some features that were planned originally due to the time constraints of the hackathon. However, we still believe it is functional and helpful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the UI we created using React Native, as well as the algorithms and backend work that went into the creation of Rise.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about various algorithms for curving grades in a way that made for fair comparison of these grades. In addition, we learned about how to create and manipulate GraphQL schemas.
