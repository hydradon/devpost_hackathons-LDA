                    Stress and anxiety is a common problem for students everywhere.

                    that hanging with dogs can help with that! But many students, and others too, whether because of space, money, or time, can't have a dog. To help with that, we've built Subpup, a platform to connect dog-less humans to the dogs around them.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Subpup lets dog owners "sublet" or share their dogs to people without dogs for a few hours. Anyone who wants to hang with a dog can browse listings from dog owners and shelters in the area that are available at that moment or in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started by deciding what functions we needed, like browsing through dogs, filtering by time, rating experiences, cancelling appointments, and mapping out the user interface. A couple of us started designing the pages with HTML/CSS while the rest of us set up the backend and database with Python/Flask and SQLite, and then integrated it.
