                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to encourage people to recycle more and the best way to do that is to reward them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    _ Smart Recycling _ allows a recycling company to easily track the amount of recyclable material that a user gives each week. The worker will scan a code that will enter the user's account information. The _ Smart Recycling _ bin has a sensor that detects how much material the user gives and that information is uploaded to the server using the scanned code. The information is then used to determine how many points the user gets from recycling that amount of material.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the scanner and form handling mechanics using php. We made the front-end website for user interaction using html, css, and jQuery. We hosted the website on a Raspberry Pi.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A major issue we ran into was integrating the load sensor into the system and reading the information from the integrated circuit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first hackathon and we are proud to have worked on this project as a team and developed something enough to present to the judges.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned much about sensors and hardware and how we can integrate them into our projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Smart Recycling
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope that _ Smart Recycling _ can be developed further into a product that we can pitch to major recycling companies.
