                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students, we find the need to enter the same formulas into calculators over and over and to search up different tools for different problems boring and time-consuming. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if we can just focus on the part that actually matters? That&rsquo;s what inspired us to create Noteworking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Noteworking allows for the aggregation of an unlimited amount of formulas all contained within the same interface. In addition to being an intuitive web-based calculator, it aids students with their work by auto-filling a variety of equations that can be customized, combined and imported at any time. Simply decide on the topic of choice and list the givens straight from your notebook. The answers will instantly appear as you fill them in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to emphasize the accessibility of Noteworking, we decided to make the project using PWA technologies to ensure access across all devices. We store our formulas in .json, used algebra.js to solve the algebraic equations and MathCalc to evaluate math expressions and convert between units.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to the unfamiliarity with JavaScript for several members, it was difficult to make progress at first. The arithmetic and algebra also proved to be rather cumbersome, and the process to find the right libraries (one of which is in Node.js, which opened another can of worms for some members ) to do the right tasks was a major problem for our team. &lt;talk about frontend here if you have something).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to develop software from scratch as a team, exercising leadership and communication qualities through the process of making our app. We also managed to parse from JSON, a new concept for all of the members on our team, and making a text-editor from scratch with auto recommendation pop-up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to turn our ideas into a working prototype, which was done by designing and developing a PWA. We learned front end development with Javascript, Node.js, HTML, and CSS, and background development with a JSON file parser.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Noteworking
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wish to improve the accessibility even further on all the aspects of Noteworking. Full solutions, image recognition, and real time note sharing are just a few of the ideas we have in mind on developing a more convenient app. We hope to extend this into an online platform that inspires its users to learn and connect with each other in their academics in the most convenient way possible.
