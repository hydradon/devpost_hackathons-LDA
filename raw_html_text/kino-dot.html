                    Lots of passengers lose their baggage every day as they travel across airports. This proposal provides a cost effective method to track your baggage real time. We utilized capabilities of photon-particle to utilize wifi switching capabilities to identify the location of the baggage, supported by accelerometer motion tracking.

                    How did we do it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized wifi switching capability and the accelerometer measurements to track motion and position of the luggage.
The accelerometer is utilized to switch the device to airplane mode once the flight takes off and lands...

                <p>
                    We have currently, come up with working concept that can track the luggage with minimal power bank mounted on the chip. The device we propose, switches on periodically, access its own location, upload it to the cloud and go back to sleep in order to conserve energy.

                    What's next for Kino-dot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Kino-dot is still in its concept stage. We are still working on a prototype that can fully showcase Kino-dot's potential.There are many existing products in the market which utilize GSM/GPRS modules to lead to tracking of luggage, but these ideas seems to involve a maintenance cost for the cellular device.Kino-dot is different in using wifi switching and identification to come-up with the location.
