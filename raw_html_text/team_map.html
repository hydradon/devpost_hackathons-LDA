                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is just hard to find people to play with sometimes
it's good to know whenever anybody else wants to do something
with someone else or is looking for people
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Posts events to a Google Maps and table object where they show up on a table and you can
join
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used Ruby on Rails and Javascript to load the Google Map objects
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning to work with the geocode gem and google maps
API to get a manageable project. Plus working on website 
by myself was very time consuming
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting a search function to work to look for opportunities around a certain area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A great deal about the Ruby on Rails framework as well as clever ways to get it to play
nice with javascript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for team_map
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working on smoother routes and making it look better. Plus a lot more personalization. I didn't
get the time to work on user profiles and making sure every user gets a different instance of the
application.
