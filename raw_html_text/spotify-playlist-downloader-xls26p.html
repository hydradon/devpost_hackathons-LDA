                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We saw that you needed spotify premium to download a playlist and though that there was a better way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It downloads mp3 files from a spotify playlist
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It scrapes the names of the songs from the playlist link and then uses a tool called youtube-dl to download each file from youtube.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the scraping to work and integrating youtube-dl with the java application were hard.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    Making it work
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to run terminal commands from java

                    What's next for Spotify-Playlist-Downloader
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making it more usable, because currently it only works when run from eclipse and when youtube-dl is installed in the exact right place.
