                    Inspiration - Citation was one of the things that I used the most during my college years. In school, I used MLA, APA, and Chicago style. So, every time I had to write an essay I had to go and search online for the correct citation format. So, I thought it would be awesome to have an Alexa skill to help me with citations.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does - This skill can help students refresh their MLA citation skills. The MLA Style skill can help with in-text citation for indirect sources, electronic sources and printed sources with known/unknown author. Also, Works Cited page for printed or electronic sources such as a website page. All information has been provided by Purdue OWL.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it - First, I created a script, then the Alexa skill interface, and then connected to the Lambda server.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into - trying to organize all this information in a way that would make sense.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of - Couple months ago I only knew how to tell Alexa to play music. Now, I've already created 2 skills.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned - I've learned so much in this past month while creating my skill. I didn't know it could be this easy to create an skill.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MLA Style Alexa Skill - I'll keep implementing the skill with more information.
