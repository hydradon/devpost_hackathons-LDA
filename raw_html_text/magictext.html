                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    OUr inspiration for this app came from our own experiences from school and every day life. At school, we are loaded with a bunch of handwritten homework assignments and essays, not to mention tons of notes. These papers are easily misplaced and are difficult to edit. Therefore we wanted a way to transform these papers into digital copies
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Converts handwritten and text-based hard copies into a digital format
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used android studio and balsamiq to design our app. OCR mobile vision text will be implemented to help with image recognition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally, we designed an ios app using Balsamiq. However, because we only had access to pc laptops, we decided to go with an android app. However, the process of downloading android studio took way too long and we weren't able to implement many of our ideas in time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of our idea and excited for the possibilities it will bring to both the workplace and schools. We are also proud of our team and our ability to work together as a unit through the hardships we faced.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From this hackathon, we learned a whole lot on android app development. We learned that it takes trial and error to build a project and the process isn't always as straightforward as we would like it to be.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MagicText
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MagicText will one day be found on both Android and IOS so that we can make everyone's life easier with this efficient tool.
