                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our members, Alex Marwaha, went to Johns Hopkins for a college visit one day. During his visit, he noticed that researchers spent a significant amount of time searching and compiling articles for research. The process of compiling these articles took place in "Journal clubs," where various other scientists convened to discuss important medical papers. After consulting with researchers at Johns Hopkins, Alex found out that this process was time consuming and tedious for the researchers. Alex thought to himself, "how could this process be streamlined?" The result of his thinking was #TrendingInMedicine, a modern webapp based off Twitter.

                    We ran into a lot of challenges, particularly because we needed to handle large amounts of data. As a group, we got absolutely zero sleep and fought hard through problems we encountered.
