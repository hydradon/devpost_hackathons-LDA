                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Terrible experiences of host-picked playlists at student parties. PyPly aims to democratise music selections at all parties, large and small.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Twilio SMS talks to a Flask endpoint, passing received text messages on to a Python server running on LayerShift's Jelastic platform. These control SMS messages manipulate playlists stored in MariaDB, and pass messages onto a client application via a Redis based queue. This client application is what sits on the party hosts laptop - responsible for organising and playing back the top rated tracks via Spotify. Trello-based playlist display and Twilio based song preview mechanisms also interact with the server side component.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Last minute changes to communications libraries (a switch from 0MQ to Redis with 6 hours to go!). Initial trouble with LayerShift platform, and the various APIs/technologies (most notably OAuth troubles, and an extremely basic Spotify desktop API) - many of which were completely new to the team. All this along with the usual sleep deprivation made for an 'interesting' 36 hours!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I feel very proud of the feature set we were able to put together in the time period, especially given the difficulties we faced. The breadth, and non-standard use of the APIs we chose presented an impressive challenge - and we are very pleased with our performance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Importance of focussing on core features, before branching out into 'stretch goals'. Coordination of individual work, to prevent overlap.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PyPly
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cleanup of code base prior to hopeful release as open source project. Hopefully has a bright future at student parties for many years to come!
                </p>
