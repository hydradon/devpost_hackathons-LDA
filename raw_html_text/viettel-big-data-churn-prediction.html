                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Viettel gave us a 1-million-row dataset from their own customer data, which is a great oppoturnity for students like us to practice machine learning with (pretty) big data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given a piece of Viettel (telco) customer data, our model can intelligently tell if he is going to cancel service in the near future (next few months) or not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The tool we use is RStudio, a nice and free tool tailored for data scientists. The science behind? It is deep learning, an emerging field in AI. We built a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with 5 layers in the keras framework (in R). The model was trained on the given dataset.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are new to R (started to use it in this contest).

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are able to learn R and deep learning fast. We are able to think of a way to transform the given data.

                    We're not stopping. It's our goal now to dive deeper into the already deep learning world ^^

                <h2>
                    How to use our model?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the submitted zip file, there is a R file called predict.R and a model file called pp_relu64_relu64_sig.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Change the input file path from E:/Study/Hackathon/bai1test/test2 to the path of the csv file used for testing.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Change the path to the model file from E:/Study/Hackathon/pp_relu64_relu64_sig to the correct path on the testing platform.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Run the file to see a truth table of the prediction result.
