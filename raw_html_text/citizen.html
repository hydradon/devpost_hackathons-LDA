                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jame's loves graphic design and Jacob has some experience making small games in Java. We combined our skill-sets to build this game on the theme of civic engagement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user is controlled with the arrow keys to move the player forward, backwards, up, and down. The user must avoid hitting the left side of the screen (out of time) and hitting any busses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    James designed all the graphics with Paint.net and Jacob wrote the code in Java
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Various challenges came in debugging. It has been a while since coding in Java so Jacob also had to remember certain syntax and methods to building each piece. Thinking of themes and what everything should look like.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game works well! We still have room for improvement, which we plan on working on after the Hackathon. The graphics also look really nice!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before deciding on the project, we both tried learning some python. We also learned how to work to our strengths in a team setting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Citizen
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will likely make better graphics and improve the enemies and other obstacles
                </p>
