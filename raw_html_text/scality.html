                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Studying the theme very well, we've seen that diversity and inclusion are important factors in organizations and workplaces to increase the productivity rate. Yet, we believe that technology cannot solve diversity and inclusion problems as simply, it requires the intervention of humans. It is clear that keeping a diverse and inclusive environment within companies is the job of human resource officer. And that when our idea came, finding a platform that can help HR officers with their decision making to maintain a diverse environment through diverse recruitment. And keep an inclusive environment through resolving conflicts and hatred problems.

                        Scality
                    </strong>
                    helps human resource managers to keep their workspace diverse and inclusive.  It helps them measure the diversity and inclusion through their employees data, showing them overall statistics of the ethnicity, genders, educational levels, ages and disabilities of the employees. Through these, it can recommend the best criteria for the future recruits to increase diversity in workplace. Not only that, Scality can know the employees satisfaction to measure the inclusion ratio through weekly or monthly reports collected from conducted online surveys. After that, any issue with a certain group can be unveiled through these surveys. And employees can get even closer to the HR manager through anonymous comments.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basically,
                    <strong>
                        Scality
                    </strong>
                    is a multi platform tool that should be running in many devices. But we opted for the desktop version first. We used
                    <strong>
                        WPF
                    </strong>
                    framework to make the application using many libraries like
                    <strong>
                        mathNET
                    </strong>
                    to calculate the measures and
                    <strong>
                        livecharts
                    </strong>
                    . to display the statistics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Calculating the diversity is based on the diversity of each factor. The factors being the ethnicity, gender, ...etc. For each factor we accumulated all populations for each quality (e.g: in ethnicity, there's 20 cocasian, 56 arabs, 26 black African) than we applied the inverse of the standard deviation  to find the ratio of the diversity. (the more the number of ethnic groups is equal, the higher the inverse of the standard deviation is, which can represent diversity).
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the inclusion measure, we opted to calculate the inclusion of each employee through the survey. Knowing if he has any problems with certain groups and coworkers. Then the average of all inclusions being the ratio of the global inclusion.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Many. The hardest being the implementation. we tried to implement only one feature, which is the calculation of the diversity ratio. And since we didn't have a designer with us, it was hard to make a clean and intuitive UI or prototype.
