                    So we really love potatoes. And then we saw this:

                <p>
                    It tells you how many potatoes it cost to buy a certain item on ebay.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, if you manage to find the developers in real life, you might be able to ask them how many potatoes some random object that you own costs!

                    With lots of passion and googling. And 9 hours at 4 supermarkets doing market research about what the average spud looks like.

                </p>
                <p>
                    We decided to use China's potato prices instead.
