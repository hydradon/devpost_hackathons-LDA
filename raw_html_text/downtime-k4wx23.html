                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the projects that we had previously seen at past events and hackathons that we had been to. We were also inspired by minigames from varius games and online websites.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program is an offline web browser game for the new avast search engine. The game consists of multiple smaller mini-games to aid in the enjoyment and addicting nature of the brief.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build this collection of games using java script and HTML 5 along with CSS. We split up the seporate games to each different member and someone made the page that connects them all.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a lot of challenges throught the competition however the main one was the number of designs that we went through. This took up a lot of our time and so we did not have as much time to spend on our actual project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of the design and look of the final product. I belive that it looks slick and proffesional.
                </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>

                    What's next for DownTime
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To imporve this project in the future we would like to add more games that you can play. At the moment there are only a couple of games and so the main improvement would be to add more.
