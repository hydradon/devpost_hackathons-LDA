                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for Responsole is years of inefficiently producing videos for our school robotics teams. Throughout middle and upper school we found it impossible to manage our resources. Attempting to coordinate a large scale production with a lot of people and equipment meant that our production timeline never stayed on track. In addition, many animators and producers managing their schedules and productions expressed similar issues. Separately, none of the tools we tried were specialized enough, so we decided to create Responsole to fill in the gaps.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Responsole is a tool for content creators to help manage their media creation.

                <h2>
                    How we built Responsole
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Responsole is a combination of the Google Cloud Platform and MongoDB. The databasing capabilities of MongoDB allow us to organize the video flow and suggest how to most efficiently film. GCP combines the media which is hosted in the google cloud with the prioritization data from MongoDB. This combined package is then sent through our webserver to the front-end user interface.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During the weekend, we ran into many problems, many of which absorbed much of our time. One recurring problem that we faced were issues with pointing our domain to link properly to our host.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team is proud to have created Responsole in such a constrained timeline. We made a complex production tool that will save countless hours of time and headaches. We are excited to continue with this project beyond PennApps to bring a more feature-rich version to the internet.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In addition to gaining valuable experience with the languages and frameworks we used, we also discovered the many strengths of the Google Cloud Platform. After looking through the catalog, many of the projects we dismissed during our planning phase for their complexity became viable with the tools available to us.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Responsole
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, Responsole is in a functional form however hopefully soon we will have a smoother user experience. Beyond UI we hope to add more features including further integration with GCP. The next integration will be with the Google voice assistant to create a simple system to check production priorities and add tasks.
