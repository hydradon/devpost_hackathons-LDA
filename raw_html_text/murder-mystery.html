                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make something that was fun but simple.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Murder Mystery is a simple, text based game revolving around you, the detective as you search for clues about the murder of Judge Rodgers in his estate. The game ends after 3 days when the police arrive. By then I hope you know who did it...

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Murder Mystery was made using C++ and Windows Visual Studio 2019
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the biggest project either of us have ever made and when we started only 1 of us spoke C++.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gavin learned a whole new language, I found out that the majority of my error messages were from me going to fast and forgetting things like quotation marks or semicolons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Murder Mystery
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were asked to make a sequel where you are the murderer and you're trying to hide from the detective. We're not totally sure how to get that done just yet, but if we go to another hackathon we'll be sure to figure it out.
