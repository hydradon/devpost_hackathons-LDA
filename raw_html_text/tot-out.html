                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by necessity. 
Procrastination doesn't necessarily mean you're lazy. There are many mental/psychological conditions that cause symptoms related to/contribute to procrastination. For example, depression. Some of the symptoms that people with depression may experience are, apathy, loss of interest or pleasure in activities, lack of concentration, anxiety and other mood related symptoms that are problematic and distracting. This tool can also be used to aid those who suffer from ADHD/ADD who need other methods of staying on task and resisting distractions, other than using medication.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Made a python script that accesses my computer's hosts file. The computer file hosts is an operating system file that maps hostnames to IP addresses.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Don't code at 5 a.m. Also, using building python scripts to use in conjunction with task scheduler is actually pretty cool, and useful.
