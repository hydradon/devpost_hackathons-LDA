                    My Inspiration for LionPATHFinder was my unparalleled desire to not fail
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        however in this case I did

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My goal for LionPATHFinder was to create an aggressively easy way for students to schedule at Penn State. After seeing many people struggle with scheduling, even prior to LionPATH, I thought that we are too far along in technology to not have this figured out by now. Especially Penn State.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, my ambitions were that I could have a main menu, looks kind of like Outlook or iCal, with the courses that a student has remaining left to graduate on the right hand side. Also including a profile view in the top right hand corner with various overarching stats, GPA, Major, Age, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JavaFXML, Maven, Selenium, 5-Hour Energy
                </p>

                    Challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I knew right away I would have trouble obtaining a majority of this data. It's not like Penn State gave me the credentials to their database filled with everyone's personal information including the judges. That would be
                    <code>
                        ruby require 'redcarpet' markdown = Redcarpet.new("crazy!") puts markdown.to_html
                    </code>
                    But I digress. I opted to use Selenium API to webscrape from LionPATH directly. That posed to be very challenging at first but soon to become rather routine by hour 10.

                <p>
                    My other main challenge was figuring out how to interact with the calendar that I had set up. I wanted to have the classes snap to the right day and time, only at the times that they were offered.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was very proud of myself for getting the Calendar working with the ability to add custom events
In my opinion it shows good promise for the future.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that LionPATH does a
                    <strong>
                        redacted
                    </strong>
                    job at naming variables.
I learned that there are some amazingly smart kids here.
I learned that
                    <strong>
                        THON
                    </strong>
                    is the only time of year people should stay awake longer than 24 hours
                </p>

                <p>
                    Next up is getting the courses to load graphically, they are finished..codingly?
Just realized that should be programmatically but it's too late to change it now.

                    It doesn't, but thank you for taking time out of your day to judge.
