                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for Bonfire Fitness came from personal experience. After experiencing the difficulty that many naive beginners in the fitness industry face when dieting, I wanted to provide those new to the industry with the correct resources to create both a healthy mind and body. That is exactly what Bonfire Fitness does.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes user data- height,weight, level of daily activity, and gives the user an idea of what he/she should expect to eat during a weekly basis. We even tailored the app to help people who want to gain weight, lose weight, or maintain weight using sample meals with nutritional values included; the end goal, of course, was to help people not experienced in nutrition to improve their bodies in a safe and healthy way.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Jave IDE

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We moved to different Java IDE's because we weren't sure which one would allow the user to experience a good user interface- and in doing so wasted valuable time and had trouble converting our files to different platforms of java,

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    I worked all night long and was able to think of a complicated algorithm to incorporate all parameters that were tailored specifically to the user.

                    We want to create a mobile app for university students that will be able to use dining hall food and the students schedule to create the perfect fitness diet.
