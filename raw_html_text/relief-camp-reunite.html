                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During a large gathering like refugee camps or relief camps, getting separated from your family is a common problem faced by many people. A few years ago, when a natural disaster struck in the northern part of India, many people got separated from their families and reunited years later. This was mainly because of the kids and people with certain disabilities were not able to provide enough information about themselves and their family. This application can be really helpful in these kinds of scenarios.

                <p>
                    Using this application, we can either detect a lost family member or family of a lost person using facial recognition and provide the last known location of that person.

                <p>
                    Currently, we built an application using only a few images. Testing in a real-time scenario is one of the future goals. Additionally, we can also include images uploaded on Social media and news channels specific to a particular event, to increase the scope of the search.
