                    Parking in Montreal can be excruciatingly difficult. A lot of times, you will wander around and find the perfect place, only to realize that a sneaky parking sign. There must be a better way to do this.

                    GeoNav is an application that helps you find free parking near you ! You simply choose a number of hours you want to park (default 1 hour) and it shows you the nearby parking locations that fit your parking duration

                    Another interesting feature for non-french speaking people is that the app supports signs translation. In fact, the app uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to read any text on the back camera of your smartphone and then uses the Google Translation Api (in Google Cloud Platform) to translate the text.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the OpenSource data from Ville de Montreal and parsed it to populate a Geospatial database (using PostGIS and PostgreSQL) which is hosted on the Google Cloud Platform. We then used a flutter front-end to communicate with Google Cloud Functions (and Google Cloud Storage) to perform the desired operations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the OCR, we used Google Cloud's machine learning powered OCR Api. We also used the Google Translation Api (on GCP) to translate the text that has been extracted by the OCR.
