                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We noticed that some of the items listed in the data file resulted in a loss of revenue and were curious if there was a way to determine a more effective AWP to minimize losses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Python program parses the data file and then fetches the values that we felt had a correlation with AWP. The values are then fed to a regression model. A small portion of these values were used for training and the rest were used for testing predictions. It then continuously takes in hypothetical acquisition costs and outputs a predicted AWP value.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The calculations were done in Python and a visual representation was shown in Excel.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We felt that some of the data was inaccurately pre-calculated and that it affected the performance of the predictor.

                <p>
                    We were able to implement a machine learning algorithm for the first time.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    We learned about training models.

                    We may try to find more data that could improve the prediction model.
