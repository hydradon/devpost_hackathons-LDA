                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the Meridian Health Plan challenge to create a way for people to take their medication regularly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This clock helps users time their medications, so as not to overdose or forget their pills
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Arduino Uno and an LCD screen to make the clock.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had moments where we didn't understand why our code was not working. However, through teamwork and deep thinking, we were able to solve our problem. We also had the issue of a smaller Arduino which didn't have the drivers to be recognized by the computer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of actually building a functioning clock that will help people everywhere.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that even the simplest devices of our time require a lot of hard work and intelligence to create. We came out of this hackathon with a greater appreciation for the common devices we take for granted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for AlarmClock
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are going to continue to modify our clock, to include more helpful functions.
