                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In this competitive e-commerce world, it has become hard for a simple shop owners to sell their products and services due to less visibility online. We wanted to bring back their businesses by introducing hyper local service and part time jobs platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Platform for hyper local services and part time jobs near you, on the go. You heard it right. If you want to get your kitchen tap fixed or you need a tutor for a day for your seminar or you need a entertainer for your kiddo's birthday party tonight, then search for the best service provider and your work would be done.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not just a service finder platform but also anyone can create their own virtual shop and start selling their products and services to the people or do part time jobs in their neighborhood.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ice Cream Siren[beta] - With this feature, traditional ice cream van or food truck don't have to use bell ring to attract the foodies. Now with Ice Cream Siren, trucks can use it to broadcast a notification to the people around them in range of 200 meters.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Designing the product to scale and to have same performance at the same time was a tricky job. Plotting a solid  architecture to build this platform was a bit of heavy lifting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Yup, we built  a platform which could change the lives of millions who are unemployed or who were the victims of e-commerce revolution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If you want to build something great, you have to find the greatest problems or challenges around in this human race. Outcome was ShopOnGo. Whistles please ;)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ShopOnGo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would try out for few backers, mentor and supporter. With their support and investments, we would be Uber for hyper local services. Hope we would get it. Fingers cross. ;)

                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Install the app in two Android devices.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Login with separate Facebook accounts in each of the devices.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You wont find any shops around if no one else has created a shop before. So from one device, go to Jobs Request, it will take you to create a shop if its the first time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Enter every details in the Shop Creation form and enter Store Setup button. Don't forget to mention proper Shop Category.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Now from another device, wait for 2 min (refresh rate for people nearby in the app) or restart the app.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Find the shop in the Category it was created before from another device.
