                    In this day and age, there are a multitude of bots involved in social media. Celebrities use them to boost their followers, others use them to make their lives easier, and some just use them for personal entertainment or gain. Bots are not accessible to the common person that doesn't know how to code. There may be a lot of tutorials online but for the average person, they may not be able to dedicate the time or effort towards bot creation. With

                    Users create a twitter account or use an existing one for the app. Users can then select what actions the bot can take and watch these actions unfold in the BotStream. Users can continuously update the bot or give it new actions through our app. Actions include searching for specific keywords, replying to keywords, creating a tweet, replying to direct messages, etc. This all occurs on the user's mobile phone.

                    We used Android studio and used a Twitter Kit, a KitGroup consisting of TwitterCore, TweetUi, TweetComposer, and Digits.

                <p>
                    Since we are inexperienced with Android Studio, preferences were a difficult obstacles that we sadly could not overcome in time. Additionally, we used the Twitter API for the first time which we had to figure out how to incorporate properly using Java since the API is better used with other languages. A buggy interface also made development difficult.

                    We have minimal experience with Android Studio. We wanted to learn more about Android mobile apps, front-end, and back-end development. We managed to successsfully implement some Twitter functions into our program as well as having a solid plan for how we wanted the program to look and feel to the user. Although the program does not currently provide all of the functions we intended, we know that once we surpass our challenges,

                    TweetyBot will be properly completed and function as intended. It's possible we could implement bot actions using other social media websites such as Facebook and Instagram.
