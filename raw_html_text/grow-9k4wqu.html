                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to make this app through our friendship. We like to aggressively compliment each other to help boost each other's self-esteem. We realized that not everybody has the same moral support that we do, so we decided to make this app to help users' self-esteem grow.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Grow is an app that uses a Sentiment Analysis API in order to track a user's mood and send reminders and compliments accordingly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Microsoft Azure, Sentiment Analysis API, and Twitter in order to get user data and determine the level of sentiment in the user's tweet in order to determine the frequency of compliments and reminders to boost the user's self-esteem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neither of us had ever worked with Twitter on the developer side of things. We ran into several delays due to Twitter's developing tools. Only one of us is experienced with coding, so that slowed us down.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Half of our team are beginners when it comes to coding. We are proud that we have a mostly functioning end product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that working on the developing side of Twitter is a challenge. We learned that we have different strengths.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Grow
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to time constraints, we were only able to add Twitter as our social media connection. For future updates, we would like to add other social media, like Facebook and Instagram. We would like to have this app available on as many app stores as possible.
