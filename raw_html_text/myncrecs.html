                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to train other lawyers to assist with the heavy demand of second chance clients, having clients who don't know their record and having to perform multiple confirmation interviews
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a website so it will be available on desktops, laptops, and other mobile devices
It is an attempt at a 1:1 replica of the new CCIS criminal records system, complete with actions and information displayed so that using it will 100% prepare someone to use the real system when the time comes
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Did recon by taking pictures of each step of the way when getting my own records, then just built up from the ground based on what I saw 
Google and Stack Overflow and JSBin are awesome!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the first substantive thing I've ever built!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the first substantive thing I've ever built!!!!!!!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of the jquery and bootstrap components - modals, accordians, collapse, glyphs, boxing, column layouts, etc...
How frustrating certain design choices are (both in building and in why AOC made specific choices)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for myNCrecs
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will continue to work on this until it absolutely is a 1:1 teaching tool for the real thing (minus the criminal records database but using a teaching database with gotchas, confusing records to interpret, activities for those to learn from)
If I win, I will put the funds towards web hosting and any other expenses of upkeep but will continue development in an open manner
