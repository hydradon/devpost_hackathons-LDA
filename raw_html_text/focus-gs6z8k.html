                    Do you ever find yourself intending to do work, only to get sidelined by the myriad of distractions online? You've tried time trackers to understand where you are spending your time, but they don't provide enough information and fail to motivate you. On the other hand, website blockers feel too restrictive and are too black and white to support your needs.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sapiences uses a chrome extension to track your browsing history, which is stored on firebase. Data is separated into three categories: work, media, and others and each user is identified by their IP address. By keeping track of your active tab history, we are able to analyze the data using pandas to generate a report on your browsing history. Active feedback is provided through a bluetooth speaker or home IOT device (Alexa), with IBM-Watson and Sox powering the speech to text. Yahoo weather API is utilized to suggest alternative activities for unproductive users.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our original direction involved creating a social robot companion to motivate your productivity. This approach involved a number of challenges involving limited resources and hardware integration, motivating us to pivot. In the current implementation, analyzing a user's continuous history with pandas was the most challenging.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite pivoting from our original social robot direction, we were able to successfully complete the project while maintaining the original technologies and intent of the hack.

                    What I learned

                    We learned how to work with limited resources, data analytics, and how to react to challenges.

                <p>
                    Addition of more ML techniques as well as better visualizations and reporting. Put on the chrome store to allow everyone to gain insights into their productivity. With more users we will be able to provide more targeted feedback.
