                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed this website as a natural disaster response resource for women entering labor during or after a naural disaster. This issue became aparent when Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico and pregant women across the country became stranded and had to go through the nightmare of giving birth alone without any aid. We are addressing this issue by assisting women through the birthing process in real time if they cannot reach a hospital.
