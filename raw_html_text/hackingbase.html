                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As this is our first hackathon, we wanted to build something that is very useful for the first time hackers. After a lot of brainstorming, we got inspired by MLH, which provides information about upcoming hackathons. So we came up with the idea of having a website which provides statistics of previous hackathons for the convenience of hackers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our site displays statistics of past hackathons for hackers in preparation for their events. It also shows upcoming hackathons from around the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wrote our own Python code to web-scrap past Devpost pages. Then with the help of some existing Javascript, we were able to have good transitioning and beautiful graphs on our website. We also made our own logo. Finally, we made a Google calendar to display upcoming events for hackers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many issues with the process of converting a csv file to arrays to display using Javascript. However, with the help of the awesome mentors, we were able to correctly process a csv file, and display the graphs on our site.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we are all first-time hackers, we are all very proud that we finished a project that is well-polished and functional with very limited time. More importantly, we are proud that we grew as programmers/designers. Having this first hackathon experience will greatly benefit us in future careers, projects, and events.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about web development. None of us were super familiar with HTML, CSS, or Javascript. Through this project, we are now more familiar with these languages. We are also excited to work on more web-based projects in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HackingBase
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keep the site updated for fellow hacker's convenience.
For hackers, by hackers.
