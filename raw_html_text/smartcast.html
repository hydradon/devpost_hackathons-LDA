                    The idea came from a personal surgery experience and not knowing whether the scar was at risk of infection or not. SmartCast solves this problem by notifying the user of hazardous conditions within the cast that could result in an infection. This is done with a wide variety of sensors, that trigger an LED response if they sense any unwanted conditions.
