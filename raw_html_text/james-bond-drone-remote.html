                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make an Android phone bot-net, but that turned out to be too hard.  We had a smart watch and a mini drone laying around, and decided to do something cool with them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It lets you fly the Rolling Spider quad-copter directly from an Android smart watch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hard work and dedication.  Many, many gradle debuggings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gradle debugging.  It was also really challenging to get the drone to be responsive to gesture control.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making a brand new remote control for a quad-copter on a new platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One should not pilot a drone from a smart watch.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We're looking for 3,000,000 USD in series A funding to begin full-scale production.
