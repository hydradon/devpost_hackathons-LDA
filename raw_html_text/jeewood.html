                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front-end is a mobile first iOS app built with Swift. The back-end is built with Node.js and a PostgreSQL database. We used Sequelize as our ORM and GraphQL. GraphQL is a new open source data query language and runtime designed and used at Facebook to request and deliver data to mobile and web apps.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud to have built a technically difficult back-end and to have brought a project from just an idea to a working reality in 24 hours.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that understanding the scope of the problem before tackling it in a short time period is very important. We learned that planning, organization, time management, and communication are key to success at a hackathon. Each of us either learned something new or honed skills we already had.
