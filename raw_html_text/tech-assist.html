                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes we can't just be at a computer to do Leetcode problems. We might have to cook, clean, or not want to get up off our bed to grab our labtop. So having a hand-free, quick and simple way to study coding question is a great way to use that google mini sitting at home.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows users to have mini study session where google home can help people study for programming questions (or really any other subject). It will test you on a bunch of questions you (and others) made and then record the score. This way you can see how well you know your stuff.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To better promote this collaboration we made a website that people can submit questions that then would get added to the list (or edit from google docs).

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main three components are: Google Console, Jovo, and React
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google Home mini only gives you a few seconds to answer back making more complex questions harder to frame. Recording audio so you can make self notes on each question to reflex on later.
