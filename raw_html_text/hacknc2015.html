                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are college students and we have a lot of technology we don't use but craigslist is too risky, ebay can be confusing, and nobody really wants to use Facebook due to the scammers. So we thought we would just create a way to reduce theses risk. We wanted a platform where you can sell, trade, and buy items to fellow students. We would do this by getting the location of each user and then finding a public meeting place for the transaction to take place. We also didn't want to send payments until we were in close proximity to the end user so that we can both confirm we were fine with the price and it reduces the risk of being "jacked" (no cash transactions).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a web app that allows user to do everything we envisioned above. The only thing we really didn't get to was the confirmation page for the transaction and getting the user location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is built using HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery, AngularJS, NodeJS, and PHP
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into the challenge of using a database and AWS as a whole. Neither one of us had the experience to really handle the components so we spent a lot of time trying to read. We also ran out of time to use APIs due to all the reading.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One team member was proud they finally got to use things they learned in school in a practical environment. The other team member was proud to finally understand web dev tools enough to do a web app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it's never to late to pivot on the stack your using for your project. We also learned that if we spend an hour on something then it is probably time to move on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HackNC2015
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would fix the database connections in the background as well as using the intended APIs for payment options and maps. Most importantly we would also port our web app to a mobile platform.
