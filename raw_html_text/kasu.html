                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Two of our members were on the way to Blueprint MIT. At a cafe, they were thinking about the sheer volume of people in the cafe and walking by on the street. Contemplating this, they wondered whether or not there were people who would have forgotten items that they needed on the go. Therefore, they believed that a service that provided affordable and convenient access to these things wherever they went would be useful. Although this idea was scrapped at Blueprint MIT, this idea was saved for this hackathon, as a way to improve society by lowering the economic floor for people to get access to certain goods and products.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Kasu provides a services that allows greater access to goods that other people own by allowing users to temporarily borrow items and return it for a small fee. It provides location to coordinate meetups, Dashcoin processing to process payment, and a rating system to create a network of trusted lenders and borrowers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the frontend using the bootstrap libraries and HTML+CSS. Backend was created with Firebase and Flask. We also incorporated Google Maps and Dashcoin for location features and transactions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inexperience was the biggest challenge we ran into. Two of us have little to no experience of familiarity with HTML and frontend development, therefore a lot of time was invested into learning about the bootstrap libraries. Dashcoin implementation and authorization was a new technology that none of us had ever thought about conquering, therefore jumping straight into the deep end to create an implementation of transactions was a challenge in itself. Database management to manage the different pieces of information we needed to store was also a formidable challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overall, we were proud of creating for what some of us was our first webapp. We were also proud of being able to weave so many technologies and ideas together into this one project. For all of us, this was our first adventure into technologies like Dashcoin, the Google Maps API, and Bootstrap, so being able to create something functional on the first attempt was something we believe to be commendable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of us gained valuable experience with technologies we have never learned before. We gained hands-on experience with both frontend and backend development of websites, and encountered new technologies that we would be more comfortable using the next time we would want to develop a webapp. As we spent the first quarter of the hackathon just learning HTML, CSS, and how to use Bootstrap, we hope that at another hackathon this time can be used to create something even more impressive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for kasu
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first item on the agenda would be to finish and make sure that all core features of the WebApp work fully and are implemented, such as notifications and Dashcoin/financial transactions, and completely flushing out the functionality of the app. After that, a native mobile app implementation would be lend itself really well to this style of app, where many of our users will be traveling and on-the-go.
