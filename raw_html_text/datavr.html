                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    VR provides an opportunity to get a unique perspective on a number of things. We wondered what new perspective we it could bring to data. When we searched online, we didn't find an existing solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a standard browser on desktop or mobile, a user uploads a csv containing their data. With the click of a button, the data is plotted in a virtual reality scene. Then the data can viewed and interacted with using a Google Cardboard or Oculus rift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with the three.js library for interfacing with webGL and the webVR library for helping with splitting the screen and head tracking. From there we wrote JS code to construct scenes and charts based off data and HTML/CSS to allow the user to upload csv data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges and Accomplishments
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming with very little graphics and VR experience on the team, it was challenging to get everything done. However, we were able to learn new technologies and make functioning piece of software.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for dataVR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We now have solid framework for plotting in VR. Next work can be done to further improve DataVR with even more interactivity, animations, and multi layered visualizations.
