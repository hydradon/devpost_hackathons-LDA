                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the website
                    <a href="https://thispersondoesnotexist.com" rel="nofollow">

                    , deepfakes, and how realistic images produced by GANs (Generative adversarial networks) can be.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a website where people play a game where they are given one image that is real and one image that is produced from a GAN. Can the user detect what's the GAN or not?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using React front-end that pulls images from a real image dataset and a GAN-generated dataset.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were originally going to customize our own GAN, but complications arose so we decided to have a fun and easy application using pre-existing GAN architecture.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of my team members of understanding the concepts of a GAN and putting it into use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An application of GANs! Also, some of us had never used React or done front-end before.

                <p>
                    Who knows where GANs can take us next?
