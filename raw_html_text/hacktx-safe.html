                    Our application implementation is duplicated between the android and web application. The features present within both platforms are the same and are implemented in the following way:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The user sends their data via GPS/location services on the Android app, or are asked for permissions within the Chrome Browser.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The data is sent to the server, where it is processed and data is returned to the client.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The client recieves a customized news feed of crimes, disasters, and weather data.
                    </li>

                <p>
                    We had big, big problems with Flask and Python. It was a humongous challenge attempting to create a webpage that implemented our python script. It was also a challenge, because we spent a lot of time attempting to VM through Amazon cloud services. We ended up solving it by directly running it out of our own machines. Furthermore, it was hard to find an API that provided a live crime feed.
