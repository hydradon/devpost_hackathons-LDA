                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fashion industry is one that uses up tons of resources unnecessarily, and we wanted to create something that would allow people to buy clothing that leaves a smaller footprint on the environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's website that searches through multiple secondhand/thrift websites so that people can have an easier time finding sustainable and affordable clothing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using HTML and CSS for the website and built a web crawler using Python to gather the information for listings from different websites. We also had a machine learning process to identify items of clothing that people can buy more sustainably.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We weren't that familiar with HTML, CSS, or Python, so developing and building everything took a long time to figure out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we were able to pull all the necessary information from the websites we needed to, and that we trained the AI to be able to identify different types of clothing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about web scraping, web development, and machine learning and got experience using HTML, CSS, and Python.
                </p>

                    What's next for Sustainably Dressed
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add more websites/companies and improve the design of the website.
