                <p>
                    Helps you stealthily bypass the universities attempt to scam you by allowing you to see exactly how many meal swipes and how much munch money you have at the touch of a button.

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    I programmatically log into the buff card site and spoof your user agent so the website provides you with a session key to get into your account. It then scrapes the page for the info.
