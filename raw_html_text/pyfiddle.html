                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When I was trying to help a friend out on some Python code challenges I came to understand that sharing small pieces of code and solutions is not very easy. The solution back then was to use GitHub, using GitHub for code snippets made no sense. I wanted a way where people could share small pieces of code, code snippets, Proof of Concepts easily.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pyfiddle, allows users to easily run, share, bookmark and collaborate on Python code using just a browser.
It also has some nifty features like installing third party packages (using PIP), passing arguments to programs, passing user inputs to programs and also to set environment variables.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When I thought of building something like this there were many options but AWS Lambda felt like the perfect fit because I could entire GIVE AWAY an entire container to the user for his program executions. This gives the user a lot of flexibility which other online editors do not. The core of Pyfiddle's infrastructure is AWS Lambda.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Security: Because user's programs were being run as my code inside my Lambda Functions, certain things had to be taken.
Usability: Since the entire editor is in the browser, giving the user a feel of a desktop editor was a little challenging.
Motivation: Being the single developer of an app is always challenging, I kept pushing myself to launch it and now I am very happy about it.
