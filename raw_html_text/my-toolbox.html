                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've collected a large amount of tools - and I'm never sure if I should by one that a friend might have. I also would like to share mine with friends - use it or lose it I say. So I built this Alexa skill for you to add almost any common tool to a virtual toolbox. You can then have a secret code to link to friends and ask Alexa if they have a particular tool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It stores your tools (ladders, drills, saws etc) in your virtual toolbox.
It allows you to search for a tool (for those of us who are forgetful)
It allows you to add friends and search for a tool a friend might have
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Alexa interface, a VPS to host a RESTful interface, running an Apache and PHP and MySQL database.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I entered the last competition Amazon ran, and learn't alot from design and certification so there were definitely lessons learnt - given I failed certification a few times. I found the development much easier, but as always, learning to use SSML proved to be interesting and a challenge for a few hours in the beginning.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It's my first US and Australia skill :)
It's also my first time creating an animation for the skill (

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    SSML - speaking slowly as a simple example :)

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'll put in a few more useful features - locations of tools. Don't you hate it when you forgot where a tool might be? I'll put in something that will remind you of all the places you store your tools!
