                </h2>
                <p>
                    "Black mothers in the U.S. die at three to four times the rate of white mothers, one of the widest of all racial disparities in women's health," according to the CDC. A harrowing New York Times article recently detailed how a black mother had symptoms of pre-eclampsia but didn't recognize the signs, and was repeatedly brushed off by her doctor&mdash;she lost her unborn child and nearly her life. We wanted to help create a world where
                    <em>
                        all mothers
                    </em>
                    could better understand signs of complications, bring them up with their caregivers, and be more in control of their pregnancy and health.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Has a calendar where mothers can make note of symptoms during or after pregnancy, and show symptom history to physicians. Based on symptoms presented, will encourage users to ask their doctors about potential causes at next check up (eg. "Ask your doctor about pre-eclampsia).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Built back-end database on MongoDB with possible symptoms 
-Front end calendar built with html, css on express server
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mapped symptoms to diagnoses on back-end, but didn't have time to work in outputs through the front-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Crunching it all out in one day!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building suggestive logic to connect tracked symptoms to potential complications (being able to show the diagnosis takes longer than we thought!)
                </p>

                    What's next for nurture
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on symptoms presented, will encourage users to ask their doctors about potential causes at next check up (eg. "Ask your doctor about pre-eclampsia). Send push notifications or emails before future scheduled check-ups to remind women of all the tests their doctor should run (based on trimester, symptoms etc). Use smart scheduling to suggest future check-up dates.
