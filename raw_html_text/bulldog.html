                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With past experience with bullying we feel that there should be a community for people who do not have an outlet to share and find help for the problems they are facing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Android Appllication works by having users anonymously write posts, share, message, and comment with each other. Their message will show up for a brief specified time on other people's screens who also use the app. To prevent online bullying, we plan to implement code that will identify offensively charged words.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to build our application. We also have a website that has a mock up of our finished product and explains how it should run.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenges that we ran into was that it was our first time working with Android Studio and our first hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are happy that we could create an application that can fight bullying and that we got a relatively finished product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being at hackathon was a very good experience because we now understand the effort required to create an app or website is not as easy as creating a school project.

                    Setting up the server for user's data to be sent, displaying posts on other user's phones, implementing a framework, and making the app look professional.
