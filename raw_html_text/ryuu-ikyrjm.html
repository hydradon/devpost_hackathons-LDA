                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People are playing Overwatch, either competitively or just for fun. We wanted to make it better. Players will often go into game using their keyboard and mouse, but why do that when you have RYUU. We provide a hands-on opportunity to slay enemies and have fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We provide a completely accessible way to play overwatch with a real bow and arrow. Our entire project is fully compatible with the Hanzo player in overwatch. We can shoot arrows, move around, move the camera, and use our skills with RYUU.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The entire project has 2 parts: the hardware that allows us to send signals through the computer and the program that allows us to handle those signals in a seamless manner so that we can make the game feel smooth and personal through our bow.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was horrible to map all of the key bindings to our hardware. We really had trouble with using math to set movement by ourselves and write to a specific position. It's hard to use Robot.js
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Robot.js effectively....
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Don't use robot.js
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ryuu
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're taking this to Twitch and hopefully impact the gaming company to think outside the box and have a good hands-on experience in gameplay.
