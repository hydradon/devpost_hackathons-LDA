                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the hackathon theme for cyber security we tried to build on an existing idea for encrypting pdfs.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML and python to create a website were any individual can copy and paste text, which is transferred into a file that is shuffled to be encrypted and unshuffled when a password is entered.
                </p>
                <h2>
