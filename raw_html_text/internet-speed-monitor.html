                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Always felt my home internet speed was slow at times however I didn't have the empirical data to back it up. While randomly browsing the web I came across a post where someone had developed an application to monitor broadband and it gave me the idea to develop something similar and put my underutilized pi to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The client script deployed on raspberry-pi is triggered by a cron job which is scheduled to run four times a day. When triggered the client script runs a speedtest using the speedtest-net npm package and uploads the test results to MongoDB Atlas cluster using a stitch function.  I have also integrated MongoDB charts with the collection to visualize the upload and download speeds over time to get a sense of how my broadband speed varies at various times of the day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project is divided into three different parts:
                </p>

                    <li>
                        The client script deployed on raspberry-pi: 
I used node.js to develop the client script and used 'speedtest-net' and 'mongodb-stitch-server-sdk' NPM packages to run the speed test and upload results to MongoDB databases respectively. The script is triggered by a cron job which is scheduled to run four times a day.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        MongoDB Stitch function: I developed a simple stitch function to receive data from raspberry-pi and insert it into a collection.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        MongoDB charts: I integrated charts with the speed test collection to visualize the broadband speeds over time
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There weren't many challenges being familiar with the MongoDB ecosystem made it quite easier also the amount of code required was minimal due to integrations with Stitch and Charts
                </p>

                    Developing something that was actually useful and also learning something at the same time.

                    What's next for Internet speed monitor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Try to extend it by adding hooks with various services possibly twilio to send a text message to me if the speed drops below a certain threshold so I can log a ticket with my ISP
