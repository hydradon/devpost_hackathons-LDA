                    How I built it

                    I have used graph database, golang, c++, bash, google material design web components and other library to built the app.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    Helping user to share their problem confidently without being worried about their identity and get the help based on "chat", "audio-video" calling is awesome. 
Personal help is rare nowadays in many part of the world and with anonymity, it's cherry on top.
Asking user to share problem online is tough as they don't feel comfortable sharing their personal issues, but convincing them, no one would know about them and giving them signal to share online for all good reason was big achievement.
We are finally receiving traction and people are finding comfortable to share some of their deep problem and getting help all anonymously. 
Since, it's just a start, our aim is more bigger to break the stereotype of keeping the problem inside or limited and living with it.
