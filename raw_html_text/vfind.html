                    We are beginners for web page design, and we have no idea how the javascript works, thus we spent a bunch of time learning the language. And the backend is even much harder than frontend.

                    We are proud that we have accomplished most of the project even if we are beginners. Most of us have zero experience about front-end or back-end.
