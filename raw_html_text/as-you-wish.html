                    As You Wish is a Virtual Reality application that empowers you to interact with your surroundings by creating new objects out of thin air.

                    We built it by integrating Unity for Google Cardboard with the Houndify API utilizing objective-C and delivering it to your mobile-step through iOS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used a custom build of the Houndify API and discovered that there were some bugs that still had to be worked out.  It was also the first time we put our knowledge of Unity to practical use and our first time developing it for iOS.  None of the mentors had used this integration before so we attempted to build that bridge ourselves.  Ultimately, the bridge needed more time to be built to iron out the memory errors.

                    We all essentially learned new software and effectively created a hack that is both functional and entertaining.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create 3D models in various programs and how to integrate Unity and Houndify and deliver it via iOS.

                    For the future, voice recognition will be fully functional.  There will be more environments with more objects and the opportunity to interact your world with those that others' have created.
