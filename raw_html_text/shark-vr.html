                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game was inspired by another game,
                    <a href="https://globalgamejam.org/2019/games/whale-come-home" rel="nofollow">
                        Whale-Come Home, we created at Global Game Jam 2019
                    </a>
                    couple weeks ago. Although the team members are not original members, the two original members along with a new member decided to make this game next level, VR ready.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this game in VR. We start everything from scratch in Unity. We built the models in Autodesk Maya and colored with Microsoft Paint 3D.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With only three members, we thought we won't be able to make anything. We were going to develop this game for Oculus Rift. However, the device doesn't work on the laptops we have. It wouldn't connect to the computer. We didn't start the project until the next day. It took us so long to figure out why the device isn't working, so we decided to just develop it on Oculus Go and changed the game idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to make a VR game. It wasn't perfect, but there's still room for improvement.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got people to spread the word about our game. Some people came to our table saying "I heard this one is really cool"
