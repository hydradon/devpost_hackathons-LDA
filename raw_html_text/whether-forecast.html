                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tired of always having wet socks, forgetting gloves and overdressing in the heat, we came together to form a convenient web application that prepares you for the day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Whether Forecast gathers the most up to date weather information and informs you whether or not you should bring an umbrella. Based on the weather conditions, it suggests appropriate clothing choices and provides fun recipes that match the mood.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We combined classic HTML and CSS elements with Javascript, Bootstrap and JQuery components to bring a modern web application complete with charming little anecdotes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a difficult time deciding which platform to build our application on however we chose webdev in the end for its accessibility. Overall, the languages we used were knew to us all and the most time consuming part was learning how to use it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're thrilled that we were able to produce a final product that we're happy with. We learned a lot from the mentors and sponsors about different technologies and we were excited to be able to successfully integrate the API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned Javascript, we were introduced to Bootstrap, integrating API's and how to complete a project in only 36 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Whether Forecast
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to continue integrate more API's in the future to improve the functionality of the Web App and to learn more about the different tools available to us.
