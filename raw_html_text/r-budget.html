                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started off with thinking about everyday problems which led to us thinking about college students and how they budget. We wanted to create something to help them budget depending on how they want to live.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you launch the iOS app, you are able to input a "Monthly Salary" of which you can then choose from one of the three options: Conservative (which is a more safe way of budgeting), Normal (which is balanced), and Extravagant (which emphasizes FUN!).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Swift programming language integrated in xCode as well as paint.net for visual designs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially started with four teammates, but due to unforeseen circumstances, two of them had to leave early in the project's career.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of finishing a project that is presentable and functional despite our team member disadvantage and how none of us knew how to use xCode / Swift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to experience the basics of developing an app as well as team coordination and how we had to set deadlines throughout the day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for R'Budget
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next for R'Budget would be to remove "Extravagant" as a free option and have it listed as a $2.99 in-app purchase cause they like to live extravagant.
But in reality, we wish to improve upon the UI as well as improve the computational process to better pinpoint exactly how much money should go into each category.
