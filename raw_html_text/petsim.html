                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Discussing different simulators we could do and thought of the tamagachi from the 90s
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A pet walks around on the screen and you have to replenish its hunger and thirst before it dies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used SFML library
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using github to sync our projects made us lose about 9 hrs of work time trying to figure how to prevent it from making the project unrunnable on our laptops
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PetSim
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's several different features we could add. Including a yard that the pet would slowly destroy. A trashcan if it gets too hungry, etc.
