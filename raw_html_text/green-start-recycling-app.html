                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to tackle a common problem which is being uneducated on why recycling is important and how one can even start to recycle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Upon opening the app, users will be met with a tip of the day to encourage healthy recycling habits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The users will be able to navigate through the home feed and read articles that strive to educate its visitors on recycling importance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The education tab, located on the bottom-right corner will be supplemental material for education on recycling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users will go to a recycling center and scan a GreenStart QR code placed on a recycling bin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, users will receive points depending on the material and weight of what is being recycled.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The points received will accumulate under the Rewards tab until the user meets the minimum amount for redemption towards a gift card.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our whole demo using Adobe's prototyping tool: XD
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately we're all first and second year computer science students with very minimal knowledge in using app development frameworks so we went ahead and created a visual high fidelity prototype that showcases what we want to accomplish.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were proud that even though we are handicapped by our programming skills, we were still able to produce a functioning prototype that looks good and works well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to turn a kernel into a broader idea and then simplify the solution with a big emphasis on user experience.
                </p>

                    What's next for Green Start Recycling App
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will explore ways to actually get this built using an actual codebase and try to make it reality.
