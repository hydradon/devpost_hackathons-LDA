                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being lost in NYC and not knowing what was around us. We wanted an app that would allow us to see what points of interest surrounded us seamlessly in real time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Placemark leverages the Metaio SDK by displaying points of interest and their distance to the user using the iPhone's camera. The user can search for specific locations to display using the TripAdvisor API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Determining which SDK to use for the augmented reality support and learning Objective-C as a team with no prior experience with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having a working app that includes our basic functionality goals, while still getting some sleep! It is exciting to see the potential of the app and how much we were able to accomplish in such a short amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gained a better understanding of Objective-C and the Metaio SDK. We learned how to integrate the TripAdvisor API to enhance our app's functionality and how to make 3D models in Blender.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Placemark
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrate ability to share points of interest with your friends. We eventually want beacons to appear to the user as relative to their to physical objects (e.g., beacon displayed as behind a building in front of user), potentially using the Google Maps API.
