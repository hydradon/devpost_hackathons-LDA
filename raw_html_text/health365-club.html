                    Preventable medical errors are the No. 3 killer in the U.S. 
It is third only to heart disease and cancer, claiming the lives of more than 750,000 people each year.
                    <br>
                    1,000+ deaths per day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There's also the 10,000+ serious complications cases resulting from medical errors that occur daily. 
One of the more significant issues relating to medical errors involves missed and delayed diagnoses.
Statistics show the shocking extent of post-operative side-effects, drug-induced illness, illness or injury caused by medical intervention as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When medical intervention cripples personal responses to pain, disability, impairment, anguish, then the patients go numb and let themselves go even to fatal death.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These medical errors cost the nation a colossal about $2 trillion each year through the direct and indirect cost of pain annually.

                    The IT systems need to be designed to better manage and have better results, but it isn&rsquo;t at this time.

                <p>
                    Health365.club is a wearable monitoring textile system and mobile app that sends data to the doctor to see the progress of the out-patient by having the patient submit their data, photos and notes directly. The patient&rsquo;s loved ones and supporters are on the platform to give support via messages by offering kind words of encouragements, offering assistance, etc. This engages and encourages the out-patient to submit their data to get better faster.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Data, metrics and patient involvement are key. 
If you don't have data and metrics, you don't know how a patient is doing.
