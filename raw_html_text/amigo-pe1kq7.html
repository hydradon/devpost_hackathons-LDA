                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    2017 is the Year of Voice. Alexa is super cool. There is no skill which does this. So, I mean I kinda had to build one...
//TODO- add more here

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    gives food and travel recommendations
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Alexa Skills Kit and AWS Lambda functions, with NodeJS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1.AWS Lambda functions, turns out, are much harder to use than I imagined. Learning how they work and how to deploy a lambda function package with external dependencies was challenging, but pretty cool.

                        Also, Promises- each time I use them I run into a challenge, but eventually figure things out. I think my understanding of promises has definitely got better the more I've used them..

                <p>
                    Being able to make something that works, all by myself in around 20 hours..

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Amazon docs can be made better..
Promises are cool..

                <p>
                    1) Code Cleanup
2) Get a better, more in-depth understanding of the Alexa Skills Kit and all the functions, and then add more features: using the TripAdvisor API, and more advanced stuff with the Yelp API..
