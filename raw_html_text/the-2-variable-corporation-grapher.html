                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm in my regular high-school economics class, and I recently realized how much we don't act rationally when it comes to our money. Rather than punish the person for acting like a normal human being, I wanted to bring the corporations encouraging these purchases to the attention of banks and insurance companies.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It graphs a set of loan info, currently Interest rate and Installments (but easily changed in the code), and arranges the data by those two variables.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I programmed a bit in java, taking info from an .csv file
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My biggest challenge was deciding on a project. I've felt strapped for time, and working from 12 until 6:30 yesterday on quantum computing was super fun, but didn't contribute to my project at all. For my actual project, Finding a good csv file was sort of hard, and debugging it in the last couple minutes of the competition is proving to be a little stressful.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have had several good ideas over the past 24 hours, and I'm extremely proud at both my ability to talk to the people around me, even though I consider myself an introvert, and my ability to think of an idea and work towards it. I hope to continue that trend in the presentations.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a good amount of quantum computing, how to use GitHub, how to import data into java from a .csv file, and how to thrive at a Hackathon.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I mean right now it graphs the data without a scale, without axes, and while you might be able to grasp trends from the data, it certainly doesn't make it easy. Next steps would be to create a new excel document, with the data collected, and organize into something legible, and useful, so that people could actually tell what companies were tempting customers into loans they wouldn't pay back.
