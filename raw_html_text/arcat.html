                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students who live far away from home, we need to accompany. Having a pet is one of the best ways to do it. However, taking care of a cat or dog takes a lot of time from us from our busy studying. Why not having an AR cat on your phone, that when you look at your room through your phone, you can see your dear cat jumping on your bed, your table, and your floor? You don&rsquo;t need to deal with changing cat food or worry about them when you are in a hackathon that is far away from your apartment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This AR Cat can show up whenever you want through your phone, walking toward you and interact with you.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The pet cat is great company for students who are struggling with midterms and finals. The only thing they need to do is to open our program and look at their pet to help relieve their stress. Then, they might feel better and perform better in their studying. It might reduce the change that depression happens.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For students who fear about interacting with other students, the cat can help them get better. They can talk to their cat about things they don&rsquo;t want to share with other people, which is good for their mental health.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For students who have an allergy or fear to a cat, they can still have cat accompany them through our program.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built out AR Cat with Unity and ARKit. We used 3D cat model and animations through online Unity store.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything. We are all absolute beginners to Unity and ARKit. We need to solve several issues like how to code in C# to create the effects we want on our cat and how to make the animations works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of display an ARCat on an iPhone. It is a great accomplishment for all of us. When the cat finally displays on the phone, we are amazed at how it could be displayed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about how to use Unity, 3D modeling and animations, ARKit, and how to build Unity applications for iOS devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ARCat
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we will add more functionality to let our cat interact with users.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Our users can feed their cats and see how healthy their cats are.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        One user&rsquo;s cat can play with others&rsquo; cat and let these two users interact
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Our user can set up their cat&rsquo;s name, and characters like fur color and eye color
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Our program can serve for medical purpose to help patients get over fears about certain animals or fear about interacting with people.
