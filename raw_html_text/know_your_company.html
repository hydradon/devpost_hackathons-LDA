                <p>
                    Know Your Company is a chrome extension that displays information about the company whose website you are on. Specifically, the pop-up window will return two pie charts for gender and ethnic diversity, as well as recent controversial news related to the employer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project was built by Raphaelle Tseng (@raphaelletseng), Miya Keilin (@miyakeilin), Su Goh (@gohsu), and Cheng Lin (@cclin130) at TechTogether Boston 2019.

                    Many companies today remain extremely lacking in a diverse workforce. Despite
                    <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-10-05/women-help-startups-succeed-dot-when-will-vcs-notice" rel="nofollow">

                    </a>
                    indicating that 'Successful startups have more women in senior positions than unsuccessful ones', there is still much to be done to bridge gaps and reduce inequality in these areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We chose to build a tool that makes this data more transparent and accessible, both to inform job-seekers and to encourage companies to be more self-aware. We believe that organizations can be held accountable for their diversity efforts simply by publicizing the results (or lack thereof) of said efforts. Furthermore, an organization's employee makeup is an important consideration for job-seekers, especially those belonging to minority groups. We hope this will be a resource for underrepresented individuals to make more informed career decisions.

                    The extension was written in JavaScript and HTML. We used d3pie.js to make the pie charts and Microsoft Azure's Bing News search API to collect the top news articles related to companies.

                    Challenges

                <p>
                    Accessibility to data was an issue we struggled with as many companies do not to release numbers related to their workforce's diversity. In fact,
                    <strong>
                        only 3% of the 2017 Fortune 500 companies were fully transparent with their demographics.
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also faced issues trying to figure out how to do web development in JavaScript without using node.js. We initially used node.js modules such as plotly, dataframe-js, require (for calling APIs), but quickly learnt we had to solve all our problems in pure JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Future work
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we would like to improve our extension by increasing the size of the data available, as well as switching from a local to an online database to store it all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, the extension works on sites like
                    <a href="http://www.google.com" rel="nofollow">
                        www.google.com
                    </a>
                    but struggles with careers.google.com. We would like to solve this issue and make the extension better at identifying companies from URLs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, we would like to improve our key search words to ensure we get more specific news articles related to company news and information.
