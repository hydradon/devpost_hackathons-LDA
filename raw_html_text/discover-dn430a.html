                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our platform offers a simple yet effective interaction between lawyers and clients. One of our focal points is transparency. Clients often have no insights whatsoever into the lawyers' work; projects are hard to track manually, and the financials tend to surprise the client at the end of the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a responsive webpage using Angular, which communicates with the AWS backend server with REST APIs. We also implemented elastic search, which runs the search engine across the whole platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being all developers, we don't know much about the law, so placing ourselves in the shoe of lawyers was far not so obvious. We disputed long hours about the implementation of certain processes, but with the help of the Track lawyers, we could always develop our ideas productively.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of creating a sleek and professional looking user interface where simplicity trumps all. Our solution is unique in the way it connects lawyers and clients in an intuitive and forward-thinking interface.
