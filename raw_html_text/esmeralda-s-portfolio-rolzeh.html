                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I got my inspiration from drake and my friends.

                    I built it using Jsbin and the languages: javascript, html, css, and jQuery.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into many problems when I wanted to animated the basketballs in one of my websites. Also, on the the main website, it was very difficult to organizing the pictures in the way I wanted.

                <p>
                    I am very proud that I was able to finish four websites in less than 24 hours. I never thought I was going to learn so much in such a little about of time.
