                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the past few years, most new smartphones have been released with a feature often called "Portrait Mode." This feature, often seen with multi-camera setups, lets these devices simulate high-quality depth-of-field effects without needing the lenses found in dedicated cameras. However, with the advances in object detection today, it is possible to get the same effect with only one camera lens.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This has been shown before. The iPhone XR, the Google Pixel series, and many more simulate blur effects with just a single camera setup. However, the iPhone XR's software only works with faces and the Pixel's portrait mode is exclusive to that device only. This leaves a demand for portrait mode for consumers who may not have upgraded their phones.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app uses the phone's built-in camera to simulate a depth-of-field effect comparable to other dual camera setups. The portrait effect is compatible with just faces on Android. On iOS, the app recognizes humans and over fifty other objects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It utilizes the Polarr Vision Engine to detect objects and relative depth. It then separates the subject and the background and adds blur through image filtering.
