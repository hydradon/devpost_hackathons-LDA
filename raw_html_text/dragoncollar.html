                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trent University inspired us by the beautiful scenery, and outdoorsy vibe. we all talked and decided that we wanted a device where you could enjoy that kind of lifestyle, but with your best friend; your dog.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The device is a wireless dog leash that will allow you to take your dog on off leash walks and to help train your dog without a leash without having to worry about them going out of your sight. Similar to the Invisible Fences the collar has the ability to make a buzzing sound or a citronella spray or a small electric buzz.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the the project using Android studio using Android SDK so that your pet stays within range of you while you are on your walk.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were a number of challenges that we ran into while building the project. We really wanted to use the Dragonboard 410c, hence the name of the project, but we ran into some issues using the on board bluetooth LE interface to connect to the phone. Instead we chose to use the Arduino 101 board since it had a built in BLE library. 
But the Arduino does not currently have the ability to retrieve the RSSI (Receiver Signal Strength Indicator) but with more time and different bluetooth cards this could be fixed.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    We are proud to have completed this project in 37 hours!

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the beginning of this project had done little to no work with hardware before, and a couple people on the team have never worked on a development project before, so we all have learned a lot about working on a tight time line and quickly having to change languages to adapt to problems that came up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DragonCollar
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next for DragonCollar is to create the mobile application cross platform compatible so it will work on iOS as well as Android. We also have to move the hardware onto a platform that will give us access to the RSSI value so that events happen when you leave the allowable range.
