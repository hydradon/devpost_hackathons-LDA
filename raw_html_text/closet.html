                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I always thought to myself what I could do in the morning if I did not have to procure an outfit for that day. This lead me thinking to how I could go about doing this. And thus came the vision, Closet.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Closet takes your existing clothing and catalogues and implements an algorithm that will then determine your style based on what clothing you own. It will then take this data and match articles of clothing to create an outfit. This can also be extended to suggest clothing at retailers and stores that best suit your aesthetic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used android-studio and java in order to build the main app and used Google Vision APIs for the image detection.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming into this hackathon all 3 of us had little to no experience working with the Android tech stack. Leaving this we will have created an application that uses multiple APIs and makes use of multiple Views. While the code may not be clean and all features have not been implemented, we have come a far way from where we started.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It compiles!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A whole lot about the whole android eco-system and how to code for it. A lot of Google APIs, which can prove very useful for other projects as well, and a whole bunch about teamwork and pulling your weight.

                <p>
                    Implementing all guaranteed features.
