                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by previous applications that used emotions to do various tasks, and wanted to do our own take upon it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application retrieves a picture from the user and analyzes the emotion using the Microsoft's Emotion API. Based on the obtained emotion, it uses the Google Custom Search API to fetch a wallpaper that reflects it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is implemented with Java through Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Emotions API was deprecated and integrating with other up-to-date APIs proved difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the first hackathon for most of us, and as beginner Android developers, successfully completing an app where we were able to utilize multiple APIs for the first time is something we're very proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gained a better understanding of using and linking multiple APIs together, especially under the given time constraints.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for E2I
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We might plan to implement more features in the future, such as customizing other aspects of the phone and using not only photos, but also text and voice inputs.
