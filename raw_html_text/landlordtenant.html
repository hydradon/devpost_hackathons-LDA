                    We are trying to develop a tenant-landlord platform that helps foster trust between landlords and potential tenants. Using blockchain, we are able to create a transparent platform where landlords can vet tenant applicants based solely on their payment histories. We extend the platform to be able to log incidents such as broken appliances or power outages in the blockchain, which increases both tenant and landlord accountability.

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration comes from being discriminated based on skin color when applying for a lease for condos or apartments. Our project aims to increase transparency and break down barriers that lead to preconceived notions based on race or skin color.
