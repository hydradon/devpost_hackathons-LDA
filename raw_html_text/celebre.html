                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've always wanted to share notes with others in the class, and generally wanted to feel safer about missing a class session. The idea came to me by wondering what it would be like to share notes with the entire class, and be notified of important upcomming alerts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Celebre, spanish for "noted", this application serves as a private forum for students attending the same class to share notes and upcomming important deadlines. It is also meant to summarize and provide a history for the notes of an entire class.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with Android-Studio as the front end, using java and native android resources to build and compile the entire client-side. The backend was built with node.js and mysql, storing all the data on the server including encryptions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the server and the android application to run correctly together was very tough because we spent the first couple of hours in very different echosystems and with different design schemes involved.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The encryption and security of the app, and the scalibility of features possible for it. Just the potential of the app is inspiring and motivating.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned not to code the two ecosystems of a team project seperately for multiple hours without a solid architectural blueprint of the application before hand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Celebre
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Google Play store definitely soon, after some of the code is cleaned up it could be maintained more and possibly grow to be something used by every student.
