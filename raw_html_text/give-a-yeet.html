                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HackDuke is all about coding for good, and their prizes are donations to a charity of the winners' choice. This got us thinking about how a lot of people want to donate to charities or find a way to help others, but they just feel like it's more work than it is worth. That is when we thought of Give A Yeet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How great would it be if, every time you purchase an item, a little bit of that purchase gets donated to a charity of your choice. With such little effort, people now have the opportunity to contribute to the causes that they care about.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this website mainly using AWS, express.js, and html. We started by setting up express on AWS, and then divided the work into front-end and back-end tasks based on our team's previous experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some teammates were not as familiar with the technologies we were using, so catching them up to speed while building the app was a little stressful at times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned something new and designed an app that can help both charities and people achieve their goals of generosity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about middleware and how much of a struggle it can be. We also learned how to make the most out of bootstrap without looking like just another bootstrap site.
                </p>
