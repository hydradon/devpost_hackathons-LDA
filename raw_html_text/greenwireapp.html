                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The day before this hackathon, I sold 3 football tickets to a person. I was worried he may not have the cash with him and that I would have lost $40 from buying other people's tickets to sell. If this app were to be widespread, I would be more confident that I would get my money, and I would be able to receive that money as easily as handing over cash.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app prompts the user for their CapitalOne login information. After, it displays a list of their account with which they can transfer money with. The screen then changes to a numpad, a number display, and a switch. The switch is to select whether the person is sending or receiving money, and the numpad is to input the amount to be transferred. The user then pulls down on the number display, and the number slides down the screen. The two people touch phones, the person sending the money beams to the other phone, and the transfer occurs.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For our web backend, we used Node.js and MongoDB to keep track of the user data and display the changes occurring. The app runs using Java on two Amazon Fire phones and takes advantage of NFC.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges included finding and agreeing on an idea, getting started on the Android app, getting started with NFC, attempting to install (and giving up on) React Native on Windows, integrating each team members' parts, and putting the UI together.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to get the NFC to transfer strings, which is what we needed for our purposes.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned some of the newer JS syntax, the structure of an Android app, how to delegate, and how to create UIs for apps.
