                    link to the web app is
                    <a href="https://food-swiper.herokuapp.com/" rel="nofollow">
                        link

                </p>
                <p>
                    The website is a concept to show the app we want to build. The idea is simple, tinder for food.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Functionalities:
The current website displays a bunch of food texts to you and asks you to 'yes' or 'no' them. Upon logging in, the server stores the items you chose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea here for the app is that you would be given a bunch of food pictures and asked to swipe left or right on them to indicate favor or disgust. The server then stores it on your account.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Use Cases:
The app has many potential use cases:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The app shows you pictures of food from a large database of restaurant. Upon swiping left or right, the server saves your preference and tells you where you can find the food you indicated favor. This app would offer a platform between restaurants and people. People wouldn't have to judge which restaurant to go to based on just the name of the restaurant. Instead, people pick their food before they pick their restaurant. Additionally, when touring another city, the user will get a new flood of images from the local region. This functionality helps tourists discover new food in tourist spots.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This app also helps new restaurants or restaurants with changing menus like school cafeterias to decide what should be on their menu. This app offers a fun alternative to a boring check-the-box survey. The new restaurant can put potential food options on the app, and as users swipe through them, get a better idea of what should be on their menu.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Future Development
Eventually, we hope to incorporate machine learning so that this app can better judge what type of food you like based on existing preferences. This app should be able to show pictures of food users are most likely to prefer first. We hope the app will also be able to notify people if a food they liked will be served at a restaurant today either as a daily special or on the cafeteria menu.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Business Aspect:
This app will financially function much like tinder but open up to a much broader target audience than just hot and single individuals. The basic revenue system will be set up similar to tinder, allowing a limited amount of likes per day and having to purchase more, allowing you to only see restaurants in your own region while paying allows you to see food from around the world. Most importantly, this app can receive sponsorship from restaurants who wish to appear first and more frequently on people's apps, allowing great room for advertisement in terms of priority.
