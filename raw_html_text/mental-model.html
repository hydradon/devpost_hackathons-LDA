I try to promote accessibility to mental health care with technology, through projects such as this, and my experience at Medimo Labs.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was built with React, Bootstrap, D3.js, and Neataptic.

                <p>
                    The most difficult challenging was finding a way to integrate React and D3 in a way that allowed me to create an interactive model without completely hijacking the DOM. The solution was

                <p>
                    I think the way I managed model data using Neataptic was intuitive and strong, and I look forward to getting a chance to integrate practical data after setting up a server for my project.
