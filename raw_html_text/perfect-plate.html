                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Do you believe in love at first bite? Our team loves food as much as we love trying new things. This was the inspiration for our project, Perfect Plate.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web application integrates Capital-One&rsquo;s Nessie API with Yelp&rsquo;s API to create a personalized list of suggested restaurants to pick from, in the user&rsquo;s vicinity, based on your past transactions. User&rsquo;s can easily glance at ratings or choose to open a link to read reviews at the touch of a button.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python and Flask to create the back-end of our web app. The front-end of our web app was built with HTML and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into the challenge of finishing our project by 12am because we scrapped our original project at 8pm so we had to work with a tight time frame.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to implement two API's and build a full front and back end for our project within 20 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to link front-end and back-end processes.

                    More refined searches filtered by price, distance, and other filters.

                    Our domain is love-at-first-byte.net but due to the security issue, our account details were not validated in time for the expo.
