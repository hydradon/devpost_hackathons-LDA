                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A few weeks back I saw an article on HackerNews about how a person was able to classify neighbourhoods of London as up and coming by using non traditional parameters - the density of coffee shops and fried chicken stalls - in addition to the more traditional factors such as property prices and ease of access. We were inspired to do something similar to determine what factors we could find to help a fledgling business decide where to setup it's workspace.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Launchpad is designed to help 2 types of entrepreneurs: those setting up a restaurant and those who are establishing a tech start-up. The entrepreneur uses the web-app to select what type of business he/she is starting and picks which of the available parameters that we selected he/she would like to use. We then generate heat maps illustrating the data sets and a combined result. The user can then visually identify which area looks promising.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using the Django framework with a python back-end. Used YELP, and Google API . BrainTree's API also
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main difficulty we had was locating appropriate data sets. While some were readily available and easy to use such as the Yelp API they had limitations such as a cap on query results meaning it was difficult to get city wide data. Others were more tricky to find and it was difficult to determine the accuracy of the data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of the fact that the end product more or less matched my initial vision of the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Plan ahead, so that you are not rushing into things and panicking. On a technical level we got to learn about how API calls work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Launchpad
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Let's see. It all depends on what sort of data sets we can find.
