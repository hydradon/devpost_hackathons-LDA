                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all love money hacks. When it comes to renting a room during a visit to a place is a waste of money. We usually use a hotel room for refreshment and rest purpose which is fulfilled in at max 3-4 hours of stay. This waste our money as we have to pay for the whole day but there is solution for it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Backpack will maintain a dynamic record of hotel rooms. People here will be able to book rooms on basis of hour and they have to pay accordingly(not the whole price). Then can have there flexible schedule.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How does it help out customer and hotel
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Suppose the rent of the hotel for $200 for a day. But if the person books through BACKPACK he has to pay as low as $40 as for 2 hours. The hotel will also gain profit because rooms are empty to book again. In this way on hotel end they can make more than $200 per day and at the customers end one has to pay a small sum.

                    Revenue Generation For The Company
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As per the scalability and different timings of year we would impose revenue from 3% to 12% of the total amount taken from our customers . A major share of revenue generation will be this and soon some pro features would be available which only people with our prime membership could access.

                <h2>
                    How we will build it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It will be available on android ,web and iOS platforms .Team will consist 4 departments :-
1 ) Collecting resources - arrangement of incubation center 
2) Coding - skill developers working at both back end and front end
3 ) Advertising - making contacts with the people and the hotel (very first will be bani park)
4 ) Sales management - this team will keep an eye on market and accordingly changes the rent of rooms

                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are some loop holes like justifying the price of the hotel. Maintaining of hotel standards becomes difficult when there is checkout every 2 to 3 hours. It can create a whole lot of trouble to those hotels which have a large number of rooms. And at the same time dynamic data analysing is the soul of the backend of Backpack.

                    Accomplishments that We are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think this idea can break the pre-existing idea of 12-12 and also can be a good competitor of OYO like companies in coming days.

                <p>
                    Overall it is good experience of finally seeing the idea come into reality. And through this project we are able to enhance our skills and knowledge
