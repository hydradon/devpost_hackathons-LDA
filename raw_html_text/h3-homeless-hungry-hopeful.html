                    Primary User: Homeless People in Urban cities

                        200 thousand is a sum total of all the recorded homeless people across the U.S. from the 10 cities that are affected by this issue the most. Restaurants waste about 85 percent of the food that is not used to serve to their customers daily.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We have a design a new digital product that will allow approx. 75 thousand people to locate food in a large-cities such as New York fast before it is wasted.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        With the increasing services of providers including Medicaid, LinkNYC, and others, homeless people are now equipped with cellular technology for the first time. Using their new access, this app will record their location and generate a list of restaurant options in their area who have reported leftover food rations.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Users will simply select an establishment from the mapped area and be provided with information about the restaurant. Diving deeper, users will be able to select from the leftover meals listed shown available rations in real-time.
On the restaurant side:
We believe that we can incentivize restaurants by allowing a tax write off for their business as well as work with them to distribute food if a third-party organization is required.
## Inspiration
We were inspired by the streets of NYC, and all of the homeless people we passed on our way to the hackathon today.
## What it does
Help homeless people find food in their area and select meals
## How we built it
Using React and adobe tools to code and design the product leveraging location and branding.
## Challenges we ran into
Narrowing our focus just the core functions of the product and deciding the target to focus on for this demo.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are happy that we can demo a digital product with the capabilities of helping a forgotten group of people.
## What we learned
We learned that some food establishments cannot give out food unless it is through a third party. Also, homeless people have more access to digital services than ever before.
## What's next for H3 - "Homeless, Hungry &amp; Hopeful"
Funding and partnerships potentially
