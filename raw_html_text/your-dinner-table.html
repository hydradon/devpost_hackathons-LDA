                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided that we would build a website/app that would make sure that no one in New York that is in need of food would go to bed hungry
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would find people in our neighborhoods and log them into our website. Then you would log them down on your Soup from Above account. This would allow us at Soup from Above to find said person's location on our CardoDB map. So anyone who wants to help said person in need would be sent information on where the person is and while utilizing Foursquare, we can find them places to take them to eat. If you aren't able to take them to the location, you can send the information to another Soup from Above user to find and help them instead.
