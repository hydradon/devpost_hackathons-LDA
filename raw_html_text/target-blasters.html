                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a fun game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simulates a shooting range, where targets move around and challenge the player to hit them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Target Blasters with C# scripts for in-depth mechanics, Blender for the 3D assets that appear in the game, and Unity to tie all the resources together within its engine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into several problems involving the shooting of the gun, removal of target objects, and the crashing of several of our computers due to a scripting error.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Completed a finished game for this hack-a-thon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of our originally envisioned ideas for the game had to have been implemented in ways different than we expected, or had to be completely removed in favor of other mechanics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Target Blasters
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Online leaderboards, better level design, more target types, more refined models, more weapon types, animations.
                </p>
