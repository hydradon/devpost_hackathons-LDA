                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Myo looked cool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It tracks your conducting skills as you conduct a short piece of music, then gives you a score based on how well you hit the beat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We downloaded Unity, then added the Myo plugin, which already had a baton-like example. Then, we used a bunch of other libraries to add audio and visual effects and beat detection.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the internet (it was slow), coming up with an idea, using Unity (we had 0 experience).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works! (For the most part).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use Unity, Blender, Myo. Also, if something's really hard, there's probably an easier way to do it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Myozart
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Aesthetic appeal, more songs, more complex scoring algorithm.
                </p>
