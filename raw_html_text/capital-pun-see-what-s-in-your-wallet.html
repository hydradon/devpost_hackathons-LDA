                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this website was to explore what we could do with the data provided by Capital One, and explore scalable cloud computing technologies
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We provide visualizations of a few sets of data. This includes diagrams and tables to display purchases, transfers, and withdrawals for individuals, as well as a map of locations that individual has made transactions at. We also provide maps of the most popular merchants in an area and can find other capital one users who have similar spending habits..

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Ruby on Rails with a MySQL database as the backend for our website. We host our project on a kubernetes cluster whose nodes are all google computer engine VMs. Each node holds several containers of our Ruby on Rails server
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Kubernetes is a very new system, less than a year old, so there is very little information out there for assistance. This means that the official documentation is the only help we have in setting up the system
Capital One's API went down this weekend, so we had to make do with the information we had available. This included knowing the syntax of all queries we could make, and possible data entries we could use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To compensate for the out of commission API, we created two random data generators, to allow us to generate merchants for specific geolocations, and fake people who purchase from them.
Domain name linked to our load balanced cluster of containers
Configuring Kubernetes to use the containers of our server means that we can scale this up to a massive size with no decrease in performance. We can add new containers until we run out of space on our nodes, and then we can add more nodes relatively easily.
