                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>   Since coming to Drexel, most of our team members have known someone or have personally fallen victim to bicycle theft.  Especially in a city like Philadelphia, the chances of retrieving or tracking down a stolen bike are slim. 
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>   Our application, device, and server assists with finding stolen bicycles. An accelerometer on the device, activates the gps and forwards gps coordinates via LoRaWAN to a MQTT server. A backend server pulls these data points from the MQTT server where they are then stored in a times series database. The application requests these data points via a RESTful API and displays the bikes location using Google Maps. 
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>   We used a microcontroller called Marvin which is based off the Arduino. The Marvin is equipped with multiple grove connectors which can be used with sensors in order to extract different kinds of environmental data. It is also equipped with a LoRaWAN chip which it can use in order to send sensor data to nearby LoRa servers. We used Marvin to get information from a GPS sensor and send it to a LoRa server hosted by Comcast. We then retrieved this in formation using a MQTT server and stored it in a time series database which an API developed in Go. Our front end is built using Ionic and queries out Go API to find new gps locations and plot it on google maps.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>   We had some problems integrating the MQTT server and Marvin as well as time restraints. 
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>   We were able to retrieve integrate the backend, frontend, and hardware in order to create a system that can retrieve GPS coordinates, store them, and display them on a mobile application. 
</code></pre>

                    What we learned

                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>  We learned about new protocols about MQTT and LoRa, utilize different types of hardware and sensors, and languages like Go and Ionic.
