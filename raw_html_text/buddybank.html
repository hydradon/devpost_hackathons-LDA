                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever forgotten about a recurring payment, only to find your account maxed out the next day? If your balance isn't ready, it can leave your account maxed out, the payee might not receive the full amount they're expecting, it can affect your credit score, and it's all-round pretty annoying!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BuddyBank allows users to enter their recurring payments, so it can keep a watchful eye and notify them when there's an impending payment they're balance isn't ready for. But that's just the basics - BuddyBank ties in with the Capital One Hackathon API to access a whole host of account data, allowing you to find your friends and join together as groups, when anyone in the group receives one of these notifications, the rest of the group will too, so you can all have eachother's back!

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BuddyBank is a web service built using Java Spring, hooking in with an H2 database, and using Thymeleaf for frontend.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Staffing issues! Due to certain, very, really quite bad people, we were left as a team of two - leaving a pretty high workload for such a small team in just 24 hours.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Loads and loads, mainly, design your database before implementing!!! It took about 5 hours of refactoring the entire codebase to get our entities to make any sense and actually work with a dabase.

                <p>
                    Integrate with twilio to send texts to accounts in each group!
