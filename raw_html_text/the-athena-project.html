                <p>
                    Access to education for girls in developing countries is an issue that we are deeply passionate about. We think this carries a lot of meaning and we hope to inspire and come up with solutions to address these issues.

                <p>
                    Narrowing our scope and building a framework. This is a big problem and figuring out what was doable and what wasn't was a challenge.

                    We're still new to hackathons! This was a learning experience for us and we also had a lot of fun. This issue is close to our hearts and we're glad to have had this opportunity.

                    Web development! None of us knew anything about web dev before this, and we took away a lot.
