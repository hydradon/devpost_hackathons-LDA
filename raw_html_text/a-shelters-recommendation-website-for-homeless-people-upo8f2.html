                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are a team of four UIUC sophomore students who were inspired to apply technology to make an impact in our community. We have noticed that homelessness is a huge problem in the Urbana-Champaign area. Participating in PYGHACK 2019, we had the opportunity to analyze Champaign County homeless datasets offered by CU at Home, a local organization that supports homeless people, and develop a website that direct people in need of living spaces to the most recommended shelters as a solution.

                        We included interesting statistical observations and interpretations generated from Point-in-Time Survey conducted by Champaign County in 2018. Here are the links to the three Tableau Dashboards we created:

                    <li>
                        Rashi Dembi and Ana Park worked on front-end, website development. We used Flask as a microframework and used it with Python to load in static HTML, CSS and Javascript files. We also created the UI for the entire project.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Yingan Wang worked on the dataset analysis, prototyping, and backend development using Python and R.

                    <li>
                        Medha Patil worked on the GoogleMaps API, data visualization, and backend development using JavaScripts.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    One challenge was integrating pieces in charged by different teammates together and fit into the Flask framework. This requires high teamwork spirit and time management skills especially consider being in a hackathon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The other one be that interpreting the stories the data tells out of the dataset, and utilizing human-centered thinking to categorize various groups of homeless people.
