                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by our own struggles during driving a car. All of us use mobile phones when stoped in the traffic jam (we know it's not good). And sometimes we miss that the traffic in front of us has started moving, so we are missing traffic lights and slowing the traffic even more making other drivers honk. All of this makes traffic jams even more stressful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So we wanted to create a tool that makes any car into a smart car, helping you to fit in traffic. But our idea went even further during the hackaton.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Mittify is a tool that provides safer and less stressful transportation
                    </strong>
                    Mittify is a gadget that is connected to your phone through the Bluetooth. It is following the cars in front of you and gives a push notification to your phone when they have started the movement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Through tears and blood
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    But on more serious note..
In hardware we used dopler sensor for movement speed detection, bt4 for low energy comunication.
Web back-end was created in php language on laravel framework. 
Frontend built using html5, using bootstrap framework.
Native android mobile application that runs in bacground and monitors sensors input. Notifies user when movement is detected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working demo was created.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that you shouldn't use mobile phone even if standing still in traffic jam.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mittify
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wish to continue work on the project. By adding other features as eCall and drivers health check in case of crash it could become a great safety tool. 
This tool would help individuals to be more aware of the driving making the experience less stressful and safer.
All new models of cars in the European market will be mandatorily equipped with eCall technology from 31 March 2018 onwards (Regulation (EU) 2015/758). We wish to make Mitiffy to allow you to connect any car to this system.
