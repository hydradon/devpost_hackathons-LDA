                    The realization of the recent explosion in computer vision accuracy paired with an intense drive to build something that could actually solve a real-life problem led us to the decision to build an app that would help the visually impaired see. Inspired by

                    , a free app that connects blind people with sighted volunteers, we quickly decided that this was the most meaningful project we could work on. The ability to see is a central part of all of our everyday lives. When we arrived at MHacks, we decided we wanted to work on a project that would help those who suffer from blindness find their way around.

                    Conceptually, White Cane is as simple as a white cane. Technically, however, it is not so trivial. Using image recognition, object detection, and multi-label classification, we created an app that informs blind people of their surroundings. By tapping the screen, a user is informed via audio output from their device of the general situation they're in, as well as specific objects and their relative positions.
