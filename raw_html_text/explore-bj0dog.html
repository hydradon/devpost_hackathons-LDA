                    All people like to travel and our team is no exception. That is why our attention was so attracted by the challenge from Finnair. Usually people spend a lot of time to find a trip interesting for them. Firstly, they are trying to find a desirable country, city or place, secondly, which places and events they would like to visit, then check weather and tickets. They need to find a lot of information and sort it to make a decision. A lot of work that just discourages the desire to go somewhere. Every traveler faces with that problem. And we tried to figure out how to change the situation. 
Our mobile application Explore can simplify the task and reduce the amount of spending time looking for a suitable trip. It will connect with user&rsquo;s social media accounts such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, iTunes, Spotify and so on and analyze user&rsquo;s preferences and tastes to suggest the best options for the trip. Furthermore, Explore will consider user&rsquo;s previous experience, weather and the events taking place there.
We concentrated on the design of application, because it is always important and this has a big impact on whether customers will use the application. We had many ideas that we considered successful and promising, but we needed to define our main direction. But in the end we came to an agreement, chose the main idea and began to develop it.
In the future we would like to program this application and make the life of travelers a little easier :)
