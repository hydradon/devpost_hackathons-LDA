                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought of this idea when we were all singing along on a road trip to Yosemite. A few of us couldn't remember the lyrics to "Gangsta Party" by 2Pac, and we thought it would be great to have a lyric sing along application in our car.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It leverages connected car technologies (in car infotainment systems) to allow fans to connect with artists in multiple ways: first to enable karaoke sing alongs and second to allow for fans to discover artist happenings based on their geolocation data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Modern web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and the TiVo &amp; Lyricfind APIs. Future plan is to extend to Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, and also to enable handsfree voice control using Microsoft Cognitive Services​.
                </p>
