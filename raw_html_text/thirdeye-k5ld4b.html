                    Inpiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were interested in face detection and wanted to find a real-life application for it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses a webcam and every time a person passes through it, it would detect the faces and put a green box around those faces. Then it will take a screenshot after this process occurs and goes through saved pictures that detect similar features. If detection is successful, it prints the name of the person in the image. Otherwise, it will print "Unsuspected". In order to accomplish this, we had to upload our own database of images and allow our program to detect all the features of someone's face. After getting these characteristics, it will save them and while the camera is running, it will detect a face, see if the features are similar to the uploaded pictures in order to display the appropriate text on the screen.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using python and the packages such as OpenCV, cmake, face_recognition, and more.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the major challenges we ran into was installing the correct versions of the packages required for the program.
Figuring out what every method is used for and how to use it properly in order to get the result we wanted. In order to overcome these problems, we used our resourcefulness by reaching out to mentors to understand and fix any bugs errors that we've encountered. We also used a lot of online resources to learn about python libraries and how to implement them properly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Considering the fact that this was our first hackathon, we used a lot of determination to think of a problem, find a solution, create a program and pitch it within 24 hours. We have experience with many languages but never got the change to use them to solve a real-life problem. This gave us the opportunity to learn how to use our knowledge and integrate it in many ways. This also proved that we are able to work under time constraints while still creating a project of high quality.
