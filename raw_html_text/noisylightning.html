                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were considering applications for social good and after much consideration decided to go with a simple application that would benefit everyone. That was to take the weather forecast and convert it into music. With the recent Hurricanes in Florida and South Carolina also made us wonder if there was another way we could represent the danger of the oncoming storm and if more would take the warnings seriously as a result.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Noisy Lightning takes the zip-code of your area, and after pulling the local weather forecast, uses that information to create procedurally generated music. We then take the audio file and host it online along with a changing representation of the forecast during that period to increase the visibility of our application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Google-cloud and Spring to host our application
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the biggest challenges we ran into were getting the front-end of the web page set up and getting the weather data file to play nice and be usable across many different calls and zip codes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our ability to match weather to both music and changing image on the website. The other thing we are proud of is that we were able to blend the weather forecast into an almost seamless transition from one 3 hour period to the next. We are also proud that the webpage re-sizes to fit any device from computer to mobile phone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Over the course of this project we learned a lot about not only React but just how little sleep we actually need when fueled by caffeine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for NoisyLightning
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on decreasing the amount of time between weather forecasts and to get a domain up and running to allow even greater diffusion of NoisyLightning throughout the common populace.
