                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So the whole inspiration behind our project was Hurricane Florence and the disaster relief in response the hurricane. We wanted to be able to provide an interface that is user friendly and can be accessible to both civilians and first responders. We wanted to provide the most effective way of clearing people out faster without lunch.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application has a map with different colors for different zones. Each color corresponds to a degree of evacuation. Red would correspond to already evacuated, green for slightly and blue for completely. There is also a part where you can click to send a distress signal and you can also indicate how many people are with you. Hopefully, using the IBM cloud, we can collect data and people can access it from wherever they are and respond.

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    We built the project on Android Studio and incorporated IBM cloud into our concept.Using the Android Studio, we built different UIs to show different parts of the app. We are also beginning programmers, so we used Google often to build the app/

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My partner and I are beginning hackers so we were really unsure about making an app. The app has only worked halfway because we encountered some problems with it.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My partner and I didn't know how to write a line of code before coming to HackMIT. We were very ambitious and inspired so we didn't stop till the very last minute.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learnt the importance of time management for a project like this and to keep taking risks cause it's better to do it now than 15 years down the road.

                <p>
                    We want our app to be implemented by first responders and FEMA so that we can effectively distribute relief. We're hoping to test it a lot before we decide to do anything with it. I
