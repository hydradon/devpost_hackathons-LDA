                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for this app came from our everyday life interaction from work to school. College is a stressful time and we often long for different ways to take care of ourselves. Part of growing up is taking on everyday challenges and there will be times where those days can have you feeling high in the sky to low in the dumps. Regardless, we always need something to essentially vent out or frustrations or remind us of our successes. Enter our app, OpenMind.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    OpenMind is an IOS app that allows the user to essentially blog their everyday lives through text journals or voice memos. By recording your everyday iteration with the app, you remind yourself that you're only growing as a human. The goal of this app is to blog yourself, whether it be a good or bad day, the goal is to see how you're doing overtime and eventually provide various methods of self-care to help with mental health.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    OpenMind was built using the language Swift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Like any brand new project, we ran into several problems. The first and foremost being our lack of experience which caused most of our time to be spent in research. Secondly came the troublesome importation of packages that would support and define our code. Third was our struggle to properly launch our calendar function as the viewing options often caused a display failure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main accomplishment is the fact that we were able to create and this first iteration of an app with our limited knowledge of swift. Going from there, being able to troubleshoot and create various aspects of this app such as voice recording really helped to solidify our groundwork that we're proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) We learned how to utilize XCode and research key components in a timely manner. 
2) How to effectively divide up tasks among group members and not overlap work.
                    <br>
                    3) Sleep is still needed even if you're given caffeine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Open_Mind
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next few steps for Open_Mind is to continue to develop our calendar function and allow backtracking to previous blogs. From where the app currently stands, the save function and color code rating of blogs has several bugs to be fixed later. After the main foundation of this app is completed, we plan on creating a cleaner second iteration of this application with a more user friendly interaction.
