                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our CEO CJ Mitchell has over 10 years experience in brokering the license of originally produced hip hop beats for use in creative projects such as youtube videos, rap songs, commercials and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was from his experiences working with these artists that CJ realized that they all face the same problem; being a recording artist is expensive: You need money to buy beats, recording equipment, studio time and to promote your music. In addition, without a major label backing you, every independent artist must solve this problem on their own. CJ discovered that even after an artist has found a way to get their music recorded, they still face the obstacle of how to promote it.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Instrumental.ly is a mobile app that allows you to shoot short videos to original music created by you and your friends. We make it easy for everyone with creative drive, even with a limited budget, to be the star of their own music. We give you the beats, the recording studio and the platform to showcase your talent to millions of people worldwide all from the palm of your hand.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app was built using Xamarin
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges such as development costs, solving for audio and video quality, and overall UX. We had to figure out how to house a beat database, recording studio, and social platform in one app without it feeling bulky or confusing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Without funding, we have created a growing app that has become a top 300 music app in iOS. Users organically search for our app without any marketing dollars put forth. Our interviews with consumers are off to a promising start as they understand and like the flow and utility offered.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Constant consumer feedback in our iteration loops is key. We validate and build in a way that keeps us on our toes and thinking creatively and strategically.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Instrumental.ly
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our next goals are to integrate audio and video filters as well as our AR technology which would immerse users into  their favorite music video set. We are also launching the android app this summer.
