                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a display that will be placed on important roads of the city by important i mean which connect multiple different places and on statistics basis are very crowded.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using WPF C# framework and due do the lack of google api we couldn't load live data so we gathered few information and saved it and will be using it in the demo
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our time was wasted while deciding which api to be used and due to the topic being very vast there were many questions and problems raised in between.
                </p>
                <h2>

                    What I learned
                </h2>

                    What's next for Live Traffic Display
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently we are using just google api and so in further development we are planning to make a way to make the connection secure and also ensure that the data received is correct.
