                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted more people to become Eco-friendly and pursue planting as a way to relax instead of always going on their mobile devices or playing games. This app tells you when to water your plants, what plants to recommend if you have a certain type that you like to build. What type of soil, weather, and other conditions you should have to ensure that your plant is as healthy as possible. Lastly you can take photos and save them locally so you don't use your phones storage and a Machine Learning algorithm looks at the photo and tells you how healthy your plant is.
                </p>

                    What it does

                <p>
                    Helps the user learn how to successfully plant any plant learn about how to keep them alive for as long as possible!

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used flutter to build this into a mobile app and used various API to complete it and used ML to give the user the best results possible. We were able to use ML to look at photos of the plant that a user would take and tell the user just how healthy their plant is doing. Then give suggestions about what could change by giving optimal weather conditions, soil types, humidity space it might need and much more!

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had not used flutter before so learning it was a really hard struggle
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to build multi profiles for this app in just its development phases so we could showcase exactly how it would work. We used typical plants that an everyday person can use so if anyone wanted to use it now we would be able to help them with it and show them just how far our app can take someone. We all also learned how to use flutter very well and machine learning.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about the struggles of finding sites that teach you how to accurately plant, some sites told you some things instead of saying how often to water the plant while other sites would give you a basic overview of the plant and not say any details. Using this app all that information and more is available right at the user's fingertips.

                <p>
                    Add more profiles of agriculture including vegetables, plants, and other types so anyone who wants to get into gardening can have an easy way to do it instead of having to search through hundreds of articles on google.
