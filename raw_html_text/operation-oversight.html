                    The world needs more interactive surfaces!

                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've built an unlabeled Sensel device that does special operations depending on how the user interacts with it. We've added ways to play/pause/skip songs, change the volume, and turn on/off wall sockets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One other cool thing - there's a feature where the Sensel bugs you to give it a high five. If you associate this with doing push ups, then you'll have to do them each day before the day ends.
