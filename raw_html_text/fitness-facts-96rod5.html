                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In this age of technology, one does not have enough time to maintain their health and remain fit. Fitness is a necessity and everyone must perform some activities to remain physically/mentally/socially fit. So I have made an Alexa skill which provides some fitness tips to its users, so just invoke this skill and Alexa will provide with a hack which can be really helpful to its users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is really helpful for people who don't get enough time to spend on fitness.
                </p>

                    I built it using the with the ASK NodeJS SDK (using the

                    The major challenge was to find out facts/tips/hacks that are really useful, easy to perform and consumes less time.

                    I will try to make it better and add much more facts about fitness for the users. I will also try to integrate it with some API so that users can enjoy a lot more facts/hacks.
