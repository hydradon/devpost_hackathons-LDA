                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Previously, I had a team and we were planning on creating an interactive live desktop but we were unable to implement it. My team grew tired and so they left. I really wanted to continue to create something for this Hackathon as it was my first. I started the idea to build a portfolio because many upperclassmen have built their own portfolio, revealing their employers what they are capable of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My portfolio does not really do much but display a website about me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, I created a UI for my website. I used Figma to create the UI and when I was completed with the first page of my site, I went on over to Atom, an open source text and source code editor. I used the computer language HTML5 to build the site.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a freshman and this being my first solo project, I had no knowledge about Figma or HTML5 so I self taught myself the functionalities. HTML5 really challenged me because there was all this meta data you had to set up before you could actually get a website up. Unfortunately, I was unable to complete the UI or Website due to time constraints from my previous group and the difficulty of learning a brand new computer language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that I was able to build up a website by myself. I also feel accomplished on the new knowledge I have gained from learning HTML5 and Figma.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During the making of this website, I have learned how to use Figma and how to code in HTML5. I also feel more capable of becoming independent when it comes to projects, although collaborating with other great minds is helpful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Portfolio UI
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As stated, I was unable to complete the UI or website due to time constraints and the learning curve. In the future I will definitely continue to work on this project. Thank you
                </p>
