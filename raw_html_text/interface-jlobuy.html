                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, taking attendance and submitting it to administration is a
                    <strong>
                        time consuming
                    </strong>
                    task for teachers. We wanted to eliminate this distraction and let the teacher get right to presenting material, and not have a middle man between the student and the attendance office.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are going to create an application which operates using a webcam and a laptop, as well as the Microsoft Face Recognition API to streamline attendance and maximize security.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the
                    <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/face-api" rel="nofollow">
                        Microsoft Face API
                    </a>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, we enabled an HTML browser webcam to capture the student's image. Currently, we have the browser triggered by a click, but ideally this is either motion censored or further integrated with an API to recognize when a face is found so that a picture is taken.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the other end, we integrated the Microsoft API into a C# application, which can open a picture and detect and identify faces in it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Of course, our two ends, the webcam and the API software, should connect and form a seamless application; unfortunately, while ours does not do that, we do have the building blocks prepared.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The webcam taking and storing a picture took quite a while, so we're really proud to get that functioning. Also, the API and its documentation was something we were not used to seeing before, so being able to get it working, even if just a little, is a pretty huge accomplishment for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Take things in stride!! Split the project into parts and do manageable things, and don't let it scare you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for interFACE
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We envisioned this project to be used to mainly function for streamlining the attendance process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This application also makes security a lot better at schools. By having a database of recognized names directly linked to their names and school roles, need for identification at exams would be eliminated. Adding parents or other acceptable faces into the system would make the campus more secure, by immediately alerting in case of an intruder or otherwise unknown face.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are many applications of this project, so we hope to be able to complete it and bridge the things together so that it can be functioning in many different environments and applications.
