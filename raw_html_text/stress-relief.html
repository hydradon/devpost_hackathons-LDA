                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted an app to help us de-stress
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It can show a cat GIF, with a button to get new random GIF.
It also has a chat feature, which assigns a random name to each new user. All users can see each chat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used React-Native to build an app which can run on Android and iOS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a relatively slow start, as we were working with an unfamiliar language. In particular, getting the environment running was a challenge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, the time constraint kept us from fully fleshing out the design we originally envisioned.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the first React-Native project for all of our members, and we are proud of learning a new language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In terms of design, we learned to design an app around the user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For programming, we got hands-on experience programming with React-Native. Its components include CSS and Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Stress Relief
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next big goal is to integrate the existing functions with timers, alarms, and events. We think it would be a significant improvement if users could target times when they need to use the app.
