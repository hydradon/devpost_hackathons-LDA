                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was inspired by the current state of the 2016 presidential election. By far, this has been one of the most stressful election periods we've had in a while.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are four main pages to the website:
Video therapy, which serves to sooth the soul through healing music
Game therapy, which serves to entertain the masses though a sort of political satire game
Gif therapy, which is a random gif generator and
Quote therapy, which is a list of the top 10 quotes from this election cycle
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To create this project, we used a combination of programs and resources. AdobeDreamweaver CS3 was used for building the website, Adobe Photoshop CC was used for all graphics in the game, and the game itself was created by using javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main challenge was that none of us really knew the programs that we decided to use. The team that focused on the game, Shantel and Kalina, had to rely entirely on youtube tutorials in order to make the game come to life. Although Ha and Qiqi(Maggie) had some background on how to build a website, they also struggled. Our lack of experience led to some other minor issues, but that was definitely the major player. The biggest challenge was completing the game. Although it isn't completely finished, we put many of the 24 hours we had towards it.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overall we were proud of everything that we accomplished, from getting a picture to appear on the screen to completing what we could of our actual project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overall we learned two new languages, JavaScript and html. We also learned how to deal with not being able to have the program come out exactly as we would like, and figuring out ways to get around those problems in order to continue making progress towards our goal of completion.
