                    The original inspiration came from wanting to mix the real world with a virtual one. A way in which you could interact with a virtually generated world and feel like you where there. As a result we decided to scan real world environments and then generating virtual reality worlds based on them. We used the Kinect for Windows to scan the environment and the Gear-VR for the 3D world generated. The main challenges we ran into were lack of documentation along with confusing instructions on how to approach this project. We started without any experience on any of these tools, so any minute step was a huge landmark. We are very proud that now we can scan and generate 3D environments. We learned that we should have talked to Sponsors about their technologies from earlier on, that Virtual 3D rendering it's a huge skill set on it's own, and that this is not just an overnight hack. The next step will be to begin automating the entire set up, from scanning all the environment up until rendering of the world.
