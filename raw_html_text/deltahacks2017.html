                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As cheap university students, we are always interested in indulging in luxury items in the moment. You feel as though you are on top of the world with the purchase of this item. Like with any party though, the party has to end, and soon after the rush, you end up with buyer's "hangover", the regret of purchase and a huge dent in your wallet. We wanted to create this app to ensure that we, as students, are not in buyer's hangover forever, and have the ability to return things if we need to.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the barcode of the item of purchase, we then can set a specific time period on which the return policy has to be satisfied between. From there, you have the ability to set reminders to when the return policy will expire, and keep you updated to when the date is through notifications.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to try something new, so we decided to use facebook's react-native framework to create the application. from there, multiple jsx files were used to enable the different functions and capabilities of the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up the developing environment was definitely one of the most difficult things that we had to do in a long period of time. Since we were using react-native, there were special settings and configurations that needed to be enabled for android studio, but they involved installing many different packages, which took a long period of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the app to work was a great achievement for us. There was difficult bumps at the beginning, but in the end, we are happy with our proof of concept.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about how to work better as a team, and we were able to learn more about using react-native!
                </p>

                <p>
                    We will definitely look for ways that we can expand on this idea. Hopefully it can be more fleshed out!
