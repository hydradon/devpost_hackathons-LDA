                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all aspire to live healthy lifestyles, and on a college schedule this is often a difficult process. We were inspired by Platinum Performance's story and challenge and set out to create an app that would remove the opacity between us and our health and allow us to take control of our nutritional habits.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes into account information provided by the user, such as age, height, weight, dietary restrictions, and physical activity level to produce a plan of action in order to meet a certain weight loss or gain goal over a given period of time. Provides user with examples of ingredients that can be used to meet their specific dietary goals.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially we cleaned our dataset using python and Jupyter notebooks. We then created our main application using React.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into issues with the react router and passing data from component to component.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As aspiring front end developers who are relatively inexperienced with the intricacies of routing and state management in React, we were able to wrinkle out all of our bugs for a single page web application and come out with a fully functional product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to properly route a fully functional React app, and build a React application from beginning to end.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We plan to add more plans for specialized dietary needs.
