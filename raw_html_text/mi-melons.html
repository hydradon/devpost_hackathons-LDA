                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Did you know that you are suppose to perform a breast self exam every month to detect for possible lumps? All genders can be diagnosed with breast cancer and these exams can help catch it early on. Now, when was the last time you performed a breast exam on yourself? For many of us on the team, we didn't even know that we were supposed to every month, nevertheless how! We hope our app can advocate for awareness of breast cancer as well as empower our users to be confident when they perform these exams.
