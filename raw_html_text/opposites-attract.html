                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create something that's Valentine's Day inspired but with a bit of a humorous twist.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It creates romantic matches for you based on someone who's the exact opposite of everything you really want in your potential partner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built out the html and css for a website and than created an algorithm in python. We than connected the two using Flask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting our python and HTML and getting the information from our form to actually interact with the HTML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The CSS turned out very nicely and finally getting Flask to work was the best thing ever.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned

                    What's next for Opposites Attract
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a log in system as well as creating functions where you get to pick the type of opposites you meet. Someone who will only hate you, someone you'll hate and your absolute worst enemy.
