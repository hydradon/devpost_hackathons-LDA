                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are so many apps that let you record the amount of ounces you drink, but sometimes you're not able to finish a drink. So we made this app to allow us to measure the amount finished by just touching the screen to record the amount drank!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can measure any container of water you're about to drink (or already drank!) to log how amount of liquids there is. The container can be half filled and it can still detect the amount that is already gone!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wrote Drink Up in Swift with ARKit and Xcode.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially were using AR Foundation with Unity, but we kept running into issues with Unity, so we had to quickly convert our project into Swift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we managed a quick pivot from Unity to Swift after Unity didn't work out. We're also proud of producing a project in such a short amount of time in a language none of us are familiar with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Swift and Xcode, since none of us have ever developed an app before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Drink Up
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Definitely a user login in so each person can track their previous amounts of daily fluid intake and a sort of database that can let the user pick the kind of drink they had to drank. Being able to detect the amount of caffeine is in that drink (given a database) and be able to detect the additional amount of water needed to drink to make up for that dehydration from caffeine would also be super cool!
