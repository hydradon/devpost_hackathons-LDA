                    Our team was inspired to find an innovative way to visualize data. With the world becoming more interconnected, we envisioned a platform that facilitates information sharing around the globe. This was the seed of our idea to visualize data on a 3-D model of our world. After looking through the Bloomberg API, we quickly found data that spanned different countries and continents. We also noticed that while Bloomberg functions have implemented sophisticated visualizations, there was an opportunity to introduce another dimension. 
    We looked through search engines to find data displayed in a similar manner and the closest web page we found was Google Earth. We think there is an undiscovered niche for combining geographic information with other forms of data.
    In order to implement a 3-D model of Earth on a webpage, we used webgl, a JavaScript API for rendering 3-D computer graphics. Once we implemented the globe, we had the task of mapping data onto it. We found it natural to split data by country since many of the Bloomberg cusips had Country abbreviations. Our largest challenge involved connected the back end data to the front end. We were required to learn node.js, amazon web services, dynamodb, three.js, and integrate those technologies with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
    We believe there is a lot of potential for this web app. We would like to create a platform for Internet users across the globe, to obtain objective information about the globe. Looking forward, we plan to integrate more data, including data from Bloomberg. Our data visualization can also support historical data to show how the world has changed over time. We would also like to import data from Wikipedia, to make a visual encyclopedia. The directions of the projects are vast, and we believe we could change the way people obtain news and information.
