                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought of times that a person is alone not by choice. Times that make a person lonely and sad, and we decided we need to come up with a solution for the lonely people, a solution for good.

                <p>
                    The app lets you create an event, which describes what you want to do (for example, going for coffee), and notifies about it to all the people in 200 meters distance from you. You can also browse the feed and check out the events that are happening right now in a distance of 1.5 km or less, and not more than 30 minutes ago.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a cloud platform heroku as a service, which allows the application to handle a large amount of users at once. Other than that we used node.js for building the server side. We used HTML5, CSS3 and jquery to create the client side, and then we connected that to Android.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulty downloading and running the Android Studio program on the computers, which cost us a lot of time. also, a problem in the internet that caused the heroku services to quit working.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We managed to create an app that includes all of the platforms and services and makes them all work as a unit.

                <p>
                    We learned how to use a cloud platform as a service, we learned how to write a server side with node.js. Moreover, we learned how to use HTML5, CSS3 and jquery in order to create the client side. We learned how to use Android Studio and how to merge web apps with Android.

                    First, chats system that lets the participants of the events talk to each other easily and immediately. also, they will be able to chat with a specific participant from within the entire group.
In addition to that, we will make it possible for users to select their interests and filter the notification they will get.
Finally, users will have an option of choosing the age range that they would like to meet with.
