                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To develop a novel solution of demand side management for non-household sites
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firstly, collect all sites information, then generate the site energy and water performance scorecard. Divid all sites into four domains (for energy), then find out which site has bad energy performance, related priority is set up and with different solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Demand side management technologies, like distribution energy generation, shift energy usage, energy efficiency improvement
                </p>

                <p>
                    Find out which site should the manager focus on, short-term and long-term plan is identified.
