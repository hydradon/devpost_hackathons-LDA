                    After finding out that irritable bowel syndrome affects up to 15% of the global population, and that there are known dietary changes that can help people with IBS, we decided to build a tool to help people with IBS manage their diet and symptoms. Better Belly uses Google Cloud Platform computer vision optical character recognition to read food labels so that a user can take a quick picture of a product and decide whether consuming the food is a healthy choice given its FODMAP levels. FODMAP is an acronym referring to Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides and Polyols which identifies foods with molecules that are often poorly absorbed by those with IBS.
