                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the user friendliness of both Uber and Lyft, we tried to incorporate elements of both into the RISD Rides mobile application. Despite having access to RISD Rides&rsquo; drop-off service, majority of students surveyed had reported that the system is rather problematic: wait times are long, and students are uninformed when their ride arrives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app will improve the accessibility of the RISD Rides system. It will not only make it easier to select their pick up and drop off destinations, but also notify the user once their ride has arrived.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a visual prototype of the app using Photoshop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we ran into were planning out how to design the app in the most user-friendly and simple way, such as figuring out how to simplify the steps and the design. We also faced challenges trying to adapt the design to both Android and iOS platforms.

                <p>
                    Learning how to use illustrator and photoshop to convey our design.

                <p>
                    We learned how to cater to the different app designs for IOS and Android.
