                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started our Hackathon searching for ideas while looking through the challenges set by the sponsors. After a while, we realized that we were interested in changing banking for good. We planned to design a bank system which could organize your time throughout a weekly margin and calculate how much time your spending on various activities in different categories. This led us to the development of Budget-Time which does that seamlessly.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Budget Timer is a bank web application used to organize your time throughout a weekly margin and calculate how much time your spending on various activities in different categories. This app will keep you up to date with your weekly schedule as well as suggest any improvements and adjustments you can make to your routine to improve your well-being or achieve any goals you've set for yourself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Bootstrap to construct the front end of our web application including the login and create account pages as well as the interactive input and output pages of our program. We used Javascript as client-side scripting and Java as the server-side. The details of these pages were all stored into an SQL database which was linked to Servlets which interacted with the front-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulty with implementing the API's and hit several dead ends throughout the Hackathon. Most of us were relatively new to Git-Hub and struggled with pushing and pulling each others repositories and tending to overwrite one or two files along the way. We also had a tough experience implementing our server sided Java as we endeavored one or two challenged when inputting various user details.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our ideas came out to be a reality and works better than expected. We were initially planning on creating a time management applications however transformed this idea into a web app which would be easily compatible across various platforms instead of limiting our possibilities. We are proud of applying databases to our project and proud that our client-sided Java served well as a compensation for using PHP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Java as a server sided language along with SQL databases to store our input from the user. We explored unique planning techniques using a flow-chart to depict the various stages of our project and limiting each step to a specific duration of the 24-hour event. This was also one of the first times we worked in groups of four in such an extensive and draining, yet also enjoyable experience of being in a talented batch of developers, learning from each other throughout the event.

                    Machine learning algorithms can increase quality of budget suggestions.
