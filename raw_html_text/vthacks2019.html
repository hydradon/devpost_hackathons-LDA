                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team, we brainstormed problems that were relevant and interesting to us. We all watch anime, and found that we could all use a recommendations engine based on the anime we enjoyed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Our personalized anime recommendations engine provides a list of ten anime shows based on one that the user provides.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The user can also constrain results by setting a minimum score threshold, whether the anime is a TV show or not, and whether it has finished airing or not.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The front-end was built with Angular 7 using Material-UI.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Back-end was built with Flask using CORS, so that our Python script that performed the data analysis could be ran.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Data was fetched from an existing dataset pulled from MyAnimeList, and is up to date as of 02/04/2019. The analysis script uses tf-idf, count vectorization and cosine similarity on synopsis' and genres to determine similarity between different anime.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Anime is sorted based on cosine similarity, and is then filtered based on above filters and then returned.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        CORS kept preventing us from making requests with parameters.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Dealing with over 15,000 datapoints on relatively low-end machines took a long time for every analysis performed.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        One team member learned and applied front-end development using Angular 7 for the first time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        NLTK, tf-idf and cosine similarity were all new concepts. Implementation was effective in determining recommendations.
                    </li>
