                <p>
                    Ever feel stressed, sad, or generally bad? We wanted to make an app that would help lift up your spirits when you felt down.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using Android Studio and drew in Medibang.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first Hackathon, and we both had to learn how to use Android Studio. Our coding experience was also very limited, from no experience to half a semester of COS 126, so learning to code our app required a lot of research.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Android Studio and created an app using it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use Android Studio (also coding takes a long time there are many rules for your code to turn out the way you want it to).

                    What's next for Tapp

                <p>
                    Adding more fidgets like sliding Kevin back and forth, some animation, a working meme generator.
