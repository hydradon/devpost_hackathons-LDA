                    It is estimated that we need an additional 2 million scientists and engineers. We would like at least 1 million to be women. At Science Rocks, we know that if you don&rsquo;t get girls doing triple science, you will not get enough female STEM graduates.
The Society of Science Educators states that pupils studying double science are much less likely to study science at A Level.

                    Without triple science and A level science, how many career doors are you closing before you&rsquo;ve even finished being a teenager?

                    It is an award winning multi media project that encourages more girls to do triple science at GCSE. We do this through our science revision films. We&rsquo;ve made over 80 in the last two years and they&rsquo;ve been seen around the world. we also do presentations to Junior schools in our area to

                    Our videos are home made and through that we have encountered a few minor problems. we cannot do the type of experiments that we do at school, weather it be because of money or the inability to gain access to the chemicals. we need.

                    Our proudest moments are:
Becoming South East young scientist of the year 2014.
Winning a prize for our film at the NPL Academy. 
Having Our video's seen worldwide.

                    I have learned about video editing, communication skills and how too explain science to people of varying ages  (sometimes from year 3 to year 6).

                    We plan to keep macking revision videoes throuought our school carear. we also plan to make a longer video that we could air as a tv show. We also want to revamp our websight and bring it up to date with our image. In the future we hope to be able to sell specialised content to websights and beep growing our brand until it is the most prominent  revision sight for GCSE science.
