                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create an application to help enhance some portion of our college experience. We realized that many of us were interested in research on campus and sometimes had trouble finding the exact professor or grad student that had projects that fit our specific interests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With Render: a student or professor can log in, fill out a form of their information and then be match with multiple others who share similar interests. In a way, it is a matchmaking app similar to Tinder and Bumble.
                </p>
