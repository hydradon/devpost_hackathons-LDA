                    Course taken at the UW
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am a freshman and I am taking CS 367: Intro to Data Structures this semester.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Knowledge about Arduinos, sensors, SparkCores, IoT, etc before I began the Workshop Series
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I knew nothing at all back then.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The software on the phone gets the current location and sends request via http to spark core. The code in the spark core will update the position of the pointer of the clock.

                <h2>
                    The learning process
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learnt about connecting the servo through grove examples. I learnt the C# and android developing in order to complete the code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Reference material/links on things you learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I turned to a friend of my partner for the help of coding. He wrote the code in java and explained everything to me. Then I tried to code in C#. I used Xamarin docs a lot during coding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What was the hardest thing you learned, and why?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It must be C#. Learning a new language and applied it immediately to a program of a not-so-small scale was definitely the greatest challenge I've ever met.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What did you learn from working with a partner (if applicable) in 1-3 sentences:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Communication is the first thing. Human resources available from the partner can be of immense help. Good things will happen if you keep calm working on the project and never give up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What would you like to do, hack, create, make, etc if I were provided a full set of kits to use
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will upgrade my current project to a high level and the final project will be like this. The clock will be paired with a LED screen and a sound sensor and they can be fixed on the door of an office or some kind. The clock will point to the current position of the person behind the door. The software on the person's phone will have two modes. One is auto-updating of the current position. The other is the check-in mode, in which the user can send his location information as he wishes. The screen will show the name of the position and some words which can be edited through the software. When someone knocks on the door, the sound sensor will receive that and push information on the cell phone indicating the knock. The user can reply to the knock through the LED screen, like "I will be back in 10 minutes please wait" or "sorry I won't be back in an hour".
