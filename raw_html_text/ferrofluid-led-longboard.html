                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Build a cool project and a second if the first goes smoothl - which we did!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ferrofluid reacts to the lower frequencies because of a magnet. The longboard lights up and moves lights because of a hall effect sensor reading the magnets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ferrofluid project uses processing to read in the music and then do a Fast Fourier Transformation over the music to output frequencies. The lower frequencies are then outputted into an averaged value which is passed onto the Arduino. Once the Arduino receives the value, it outputs a scaled inverse logarithmic voltage to the Mosfet control circuit which outputs to the magnet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The longboard is built using neodymium magnets that are evenly spaced around a wheel on the long board with their poles alternating between north and south poles. A hall effect sensor circuit is mounted to the truck of the longboard ans is positioned to read the magnetic field of the magnets. We then calculated the km/h of the longboard and were able to make it do different things based off of the speed.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The magnet was higher powered and could not be ran off the Arduino pin. This meant we had to use something else to supply the current and voltage yet still control it with the Arduino. This is how we came up with how to use the mosfets in parallel.

                    We got both of them done!

                    Doing projects takes alot of time and it is hard.

                    Make the Ferrofluid project 'done' so it can sit on our desks.
