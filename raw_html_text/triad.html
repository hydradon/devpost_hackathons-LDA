                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project is part of a challenge given by the company Tailwind. The goal was to create an application that caters to small business owners including entrepreneurs. And we did exactly that to help the retailers get to their potential customers even before the customer knows what he wants through targeted ads!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application predicts the customers' needs(product or service they would want to go for) based on the information they have provided when they sign up for our application. And this prediction is given to the small business owners. Triad also posts the recommendation of the best services available nearby to these customers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The soul of the project is collecting and understanding the data set. We got the black-Friday dataset from Kaggle (

                    ). The classification model was built using this dataset with python. The server was also set up with python using the Flask framework and the front end web application was written using HTML and javascript on Axios to communicate with the server.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The API side of the application was new to us and ran into a lot of hurdles when we wanted to make the three parts of our application talk to each other.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                    Learning and implementing the front end, back-end and machine learning model and server hosting in less than 12 hours!

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Including features such as group predictions and a retail perspective to the application for the small business owner to access and maintain. Our main aim is to help small business owners not only in well-developed cities/countries but also encourage people in developing and underdeveloped countries.
