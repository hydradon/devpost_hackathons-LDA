                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game was originally inspired by the somewhat broad topic of trees. While we were brainstorming ideas which would be focused on HackSC's Sustainability Vertical, we first thought about trees and oceans. They might not be where we live in, but they are an important part of this world, or Earth. Eventually
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game teaches the players how their actions can affect the environments, and how however small our actions are, they can have a significant impact on our planet over time. We originally intended to structure the game as a resource management/strategy game which was affected by decisions the user made in their day-to-day life. However, due to time constraints, the end product looks more like an exhibition of the inherent beauty present within nature. Our hope is that players will reflect upon the power they have to maintain our world's natural beauty after being immersed in an engaging (albeit short) audiovisual experience.

                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this game using Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us aren't familiar with Unity, so we had to learn as we built the game. The asset files were quite large, so we had to deal with long processing times whenever we updated assets. With the time constraint, we had to sacrifice some of our game ideas.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that We're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's been a very good experience for us to make something we love. Each person brought something unique to the team, and it was very fun seeing how much each team member was able to contribute.
