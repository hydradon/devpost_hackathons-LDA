                    The Stimulation Project is a webapp that is designed to assist people with brain diseases or disorders who have memory disabilities, such as speech aphasia and Alzheimer's. The app is set up in a quiz-like fashion where a doctor, caregiver, loved one, or the patient sets up questions that relate to their disease and what would help them regain memory control. Alzheimer's patients would answer questions based on their histories, and speech aphasia patients would answer questions based on the speech and processing skills they may have lost (like picture-based questions, math questions, etc.)
