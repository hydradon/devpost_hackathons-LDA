                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People worry about the vitamins and supplements they put in their body.
People worry about the types and quality of food they put in their body.
But how often does a person stop to think of products entering the body through their skin?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here at Skinsurance, we want to inspire others to treat their skin with kindness and to be more aware of what they're putting on their skin.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Skinsurance helps you compare the ingredients between your two chosen skincare products, and lets you know whether or not they could be harmful to your skin.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Visual Studio and skills we learned in CIS 300, we were able to create this application in C#. We also found out how to create a domain and website for Skinsurance through Github.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges we faces was recognizing and learning that many different chemical names one ingredient may have, and that interactions between particular ingredients are not necessarily harmful, but may simply result in degraded effectiveness.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a labor of love! This is our first hackathon! It has been exciting and deeply rewarding to have had the chance to take an idea from birth to fruition - using the skills we've been learning in our courses at KSU.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Skinsurance
                </h2>
                <p>
