                    The problem of Gesundheitscloud was (until now), that the current workflow of exchanging patient data currently includes massive amounts of non-digital data. This is in part because the networks mustn't be connected to the internet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We tried to solve the problem by creating a solution, which could work in a comfortable and unobtrusive way for both - the patient and the doctor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How did we solve it?
The doctor has access to an application, which is hosted at his office and allows him to share data with his patients easily. The device that allows the patient to receive the data can be seen as a kind of post office with mandatory authentication before takeout.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The doctors system needs the public encryption key of the patient, before he can share encrypted data with his patient. So that only the patient has access to the data through his knowledge of the private key.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The patient can retrieve the data by either using a QR-code or an nfc tag in order to establish a private peer to peer connection through a device on the "post office desk".
If the patient scans the QR-code, there are 2 possibilities:
the patient is already in the system and has a public key assigned, then he can get the data by just having our app and scanning the QR-code / using the nfc connection
                </p>
                <p>
                    OR
                </p>
                <p>
                    the patient is not in the system or doesn't have a public key assigned. Then there needs to be manual workflow, where the patient will be verified and the public key will be saved.
                </p>
