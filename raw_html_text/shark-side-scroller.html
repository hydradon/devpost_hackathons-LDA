                <p>
                    This is a project done in P5 and and javascript. We were given 24 hours to build whatever we wanted with in some categories. We decided to build a side-scroller that incorporated the hackathon mascot, Sharks! We used P5 for the physics of the water and air and they respond accordingly by slowing down the shark in water and allowing him to fly thru the air. What we learned is a lot about JS and Github. We had a ton of problems getting JS to run as we had never really touched this technology.We covered many topics such as collision detection algorithms, physics in P5, and how to manage many different sprites that needed to interact. By the end we were happy with what we produced. If you want to leave any suggestions for improvements please do!
