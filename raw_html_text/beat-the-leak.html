                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started by researching common water issues, and one of the biggest we found were leaks in the household. This led to the idea of a game where the objective is to prevent leaks as quick as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Players need to patch up the cracks in a water barrel by pressing the corresponding keys before all the water leaks out. This familiarizes children with the keyboard in a fun way. It also raises awareness about the water crisis as it is a metaphor for the water shortage our world is facing and displays water related facts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used processing to code the game and created the graphics with photoshop. A built-in library to load music and sound effects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were not all familiar with the same languages, so we had to spend some time learning a new language in order to effieciently work together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of us did not have too much experience in programming, so it was an accomplishment that we were able to turn our idea into a real product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work with people we just met. Some of us also just recently learned processing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Beat the Leak
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will add on levels and additional minigames.
