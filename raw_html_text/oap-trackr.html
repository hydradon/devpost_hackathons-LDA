                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were listening to the pitches at the opening ceremony, trying to jot down keywords that would maybe spark an idea. One of the phrases that I wrote was "Uber but for a more focused group".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Later when I pitched the idea to the team, everyone seemed to like it, so we ran with it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is another story that we have no inspiration left to actually implement the idea. 
We just cannot be bothered.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's an app that lets OAP create one-off tasks that they want to be done for them.
The two actors for our user story are a tasker and a taskee.
The tasker sets the tasks, accepts requests and reviews the task.
The taskee views and picks the tasks, does the task and gets redeemable points.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not.
We spent way too long struggling with MongoDB. 
Then set up Google Cloud Platform and Google Actions.
Did something with Raspberry Pi, and created a really ugly looking single page pretotype of our idea 
(it is sort of better than a ppt presentation but not really)

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lack of dedication.
MongoDB.
Trying to learn react.
Trying to learn google actions.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Oooooo we finished a couple of levels of overcooked, that was a pretty amazing accomplishment.
Won a few matches in super smash bros (Kirby is the best), which was a first. 
Super proud about my gaming adventures, might mess around and became a gamer twitch streamer.

                    The full form of OAP.
Not to misspell OAP Taskr as OAP Trackr.

                    Maybe actually implement the idea at some point, but not really?
