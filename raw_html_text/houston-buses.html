                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to encourage people to use public transportation by making it even more convenient.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Waiting outside in the Houston Heat is awful. Alexa can now track the real time location of Houston Buses; this means bus riders can spend a few extra minutes indoors. They can quickly and easily ask Alexa how many minutes away is the bus from a bus stop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This skill was built with Python 3, AWS SAM Local and DynamoDB Local before deploying to AWS Lambda and DynamoDB.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first version of this skill worked and was certified, but users said the workflow was awkward and overly verbose.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm excited to introduce state persistence with DynamoDB.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Writing a script ahead of time is just as important (if not more so) than researching they technologies to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Houston Buses
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'd like to add a feature to look up bus stops by address.
                </p>
