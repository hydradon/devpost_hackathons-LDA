                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We just loved the idea of how it was an app meant to bring people together by doing good deeds for each other. Sometimes it can be hard and helping each other is the best thing we have
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides a map of the area around you with notifications and markers of emergencies/people in need. Anyone with an account can log on and choose which marker to go to to help. The markers are global and anyone can choose them to help out. They come with a description before you accept them. We have a rating system as well to keep volunteers reasonably cordial and make sure they are upstanding as well as have rewards program for those that are excellent at helping others!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We mainly used flutter SDK and Dart to build this app so we could have one codebase for both IOS and Android reaching more of the market. We also used firebase to populate the map with markers and keeping track of requests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first 3 out of the 4 of us did not know how use flutter and installing it. It took some time to get used to it but once we got rolling it was a great experience! We also had issues with Firebase trying to learn that but we never gave up on the challenge and found these learning experiences extremely useful
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app in general! It has so much in it for a project made in 24hrs at a hackathon. We were slow at first but quickly got in a rhythm and gelled well despite not knowing each other before this event. The app works well and does what we want it to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot technically with Flutter, Dart, and Firebase. However for some of us it was our first hackathon which comes with the added challenge of working with people you don't know and that was an experience truly valuable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Flare
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully we continue developing it and soon being able to launch it in the app stores for use. It could really take off as a staple app for communities.
