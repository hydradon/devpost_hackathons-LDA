                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even with social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat, it remains difficult for college students to find study partners. With Course Connect, we aim to change that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Course Connect is a web app for college students that facilitates academic discussion and encourages students within the same course to learn collaboratively.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, css, javascript, and jquery.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were problems with the functionality of our website; when we tried to merge the front-end and back-end, there was unexpected conflict.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mimi and Rui-Jie have never built such an extensive layout for a website, and Zhuowei is proud of database he was able to manage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mimi and Rui-Jie learned how to integrate css and HTML and Zhuowei improved his database skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Course Connect
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to offer some sort of login system and implement in the near future and possibly offer an ethical way to socialize for college students, in the sense that we encourage students to meet face-to-face as soon as possible.
