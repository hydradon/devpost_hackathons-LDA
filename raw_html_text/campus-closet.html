                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What inspired us was how students on many campuses use services like Poshmark, Mercari, and ThreadUp to sell clothing they don't wear anymore. The problem with this is that the students have to pay fees to the services for selling through their platform and deal with shipping their clothes to their buyers. As an easier solution, some students turn to creating Instagram accounts to sell locally on their campus, have other students try on the clothes in their dorm, and then just use Venmo for payment. We want to centralize this to an app that shows the user all the sellers on campus and the sellers can upload their postings on the app instead and connect with buyers from their campus. his way, we avoid the irritability that comes through scrolling through post after post after post of clothing sale posts on Instagram, and instead provide a separate platform so that users see sales posts only when they want to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sellers can easily post sale-posts for clothing, set a try-on/pick-up location, set prices, and indicate whether they want to donate to a sustainable clothing organization (i.e. Clean Clothes Campaign).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Buyers can search for clothes for sale by category (Women's, Men's, Unisex, Tops, Bottoms, Shoes, Jewelry, and other accessories) to aid in searches for a specific piece of clothing for an outing, and they can easily connect with sellers to make the try-on and purchase process quick and easy since the app will be customized to only show sellers on their campus. The app also provides a map of sustainable clothing stores near the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first drew an outline of the components we wanted in the app. These components included a buy tab, a sell tab, and a map to display nearby sustainable clothing stores. We first tackled creating a table view for the buy tab that displays the different categories (W. omen's, Men's, Unisex, Tops, Bottoms, Shoes, Jewelry, and other accessories). We then moved to creating the sell tab where sellers can fill out a form asking for name of item, price, pickup location, size, and type of clothing. We were able to retrieve the information inputted in the sell tab. We then started to work on transferring the information from the sell tab to the buy tab. Unfortunately, we weren't able to complete all the components planned for the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Both team members had no experience in iOS app development so it was a challenge for us to get familiar with the components (table view, view controllers, IBOoutlets) and the syntax. We took advantage of workshops and sponsor-hosted presentations, taking away time from hacking. We also struggled with team formation as members came and left and the final team ended up consisting of two members.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to set up a table view with three sections (Women's, Men's, and unisex). We are also proud that we were able to retrieve the data from the sell tab as well as implement a variety of UI components like pickers, segment control, and table viewers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics of swift as well as the iOS UI components. We learned how to navigate Xcode and the interface builder. We learned how to storyboard the pages in an app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CampusCloset
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to finish the map tab which would locate other sources of sustainable shopping nearby as well as provide a list of organizations and companies that support sustainable shopping. We would like to be able to display seller posts on a table viewer segued from the buy tab. We also plan to add a profile tab where the seller can track all their potential buyers and message them.
