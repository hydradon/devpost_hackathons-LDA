                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our original idea was to create a live Kahoot like game that simultaneously scans a students face in relation to a correct answer on a projected set of questions. The point in doing this was to visually produce data that allows teachers to see what percent of students were getting answers correct based on confusion or distraction. However, due to lack of experience and time constraints, we shifted our idea to another CV project that instead scans test scores and provides various data regarding a students emotion based on the test score they received. The main goal of displaying the relation to interest of a subject in education, to a students performance on said question was reached.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scans test score and displays relation of human emotion to the instructor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python and OpenCV.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not knowing how to do anything related to our project prior to this hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with computer vision.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Computer Vision, VIM (lol), Express, more Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ed Edd and Edu
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully we can take what we learned in our original idea and develop it into our intentional project on the side.
