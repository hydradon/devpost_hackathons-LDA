                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being in college and dealing with the challenge of writing a paper.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A side-scrolling game where you avoid obstacles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity in conjunction with C# in order to get all of the functionality and we used Photoshop for all of the designing except for the main character.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to change game engines more than 12 hours in. Originally we were using Java and libgdx, but we figured out that using Java was not the best or fastest way to accomplish our game and decided to switch to Unity in hopes of having a better game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got it to work in less than 12 hours.
Our graphics are of pretty good quality.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity
C#
A little bit about how to use github
A small amount of libgdx and how Java can be used for game development
                </p>

                    What's next for College Pains
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More levels--our original plan involved levels for every year of college but due to time constraints we were only able to do Freshman year.
Better animation/different main character
