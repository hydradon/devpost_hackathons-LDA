                    I have been playing quiz bowl for a few years now, and I really wanted to create an app on which I could practice quiz bowl questions. There are already some out there, but I wanted to tailor it to my needs, and add features that I felt would be useful as a quizbowl player.
I created this app without any initial knowledge of AngularJS. I got a lot of help from Benjamin on the Angular stuff, and I worked a lot on the front end to make the User Interface clean and intuitive to use. I added keyboard shortcuts for the buttons, and I added a keyboard shortcut for submitting answers. I also added a toggle switch that All of the questions are stored on firebase, and I got the question set from a set of questions used to train the QANTA quizbowl AI. I used Angularfire to connect to the database and get the questions.
In the future, I would like to add on more features. One such feature I hope to add is the ability for the application to look up the answer to a question you got wrong and display an embedded wikipedia page about what the question was about. I would also like to add multiplayer functionality and a time limit for answering questions. I would also like let users set the category of questions that they want, and I would also like to add different types of question modes that the user can choose from, such as science bowl questions, and quiz bowl bonus questions. I would also like to create a mode in the app called "Vedrun Bowl" that makes users answer attempt to answer the question after every sentence. I created the toggle switch for the user to switch to "Vedrun Bowl", however I have not yet actually created that feature yet.
