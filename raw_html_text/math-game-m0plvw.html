                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I (and my twin brother) got Amazon Alexa for my birthday. I discovered that I could create "skills" for Alexa. I started working on the Math Game hoping that this will help to teach other kids multiplication
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you say Alexa "play Math Game," Alexa will prompt you with a single multiplication question. Kids can play it as many times as they want to practice multiplication.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used a micro-framework for python called Flask-Ask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I encountered a problem when I tried to put the problems in a for loop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am very proud that I was able to put together a skill in such a short amount of time. I only learned about the hackathon a few days ago. I feel that I learned a lot and it is very cool to put together an Alexa skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use a micro-framework called flask-ask to create Alexa skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Math Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will continue to work on it untill I am able to run it on the real Alexa Echo Plus on my birthday.
I would also love to share it with my teachers &amp; my classmates
