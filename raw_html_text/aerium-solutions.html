                    Currently the whole Dallas metroplex has only two, stationary CO2 sensors. With this data, only comparisons between other cities can occur. We strove to fix this issue by making a quadcopter that could pin point exact locations of CO2 levels. This will allow us to hone in on what is emitting that CO2, and give us an edge up on cutting down emissions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This quadcopter is flyable by app. You simply draw on the map and watch as the drone flies. While flying, the drone uses sensors to accurately measure gas readings in the area. When the quadcopter touches "home", or where it started, simply eject the SD card and upload the data to the website. Our website uses Google maps API in order to plot each data point the drone captured. The color coding system we implemented on the map display allows you to easily identify parts of the city/state/country that have higher levels of CO2 or other gasses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently the drone measures methane, temperature, and humidity, as well as the time, date, and exact location of each reading. The reason we used a methane sensor in our prototype was because our CO2 sensor failed to ship in time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, what is next you may ask? Because of how we designed the drone, it is easy to replace the sensor with ANY sensor available. So, we plan on expanding to detect more hazardous gasses in order to keep the planet, and people who inhabit it safe!
