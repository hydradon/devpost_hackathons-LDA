                    Inspiration We wanted to create a site where getting information on web privacy, online harassment, and even the transparency of local politicians. The whole team felt strongly about these topics and wanted to find a way to improve on these topics!

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This site gives tips and information to people who want to know more about keeping their online identity safe, avoiding harassment, and how to decode the truth behind what people online tell you. This site also has a feature dedicated to local politicians and determining how trustworthy they are. This feature is somwhat expirimental, but we believe has great potential for growth.

                    Using PHP, CSS, MySQL, and HTML5!. Mostly our amazing programmer, Spencer Colton, knew exactly how to combine and code all of these languages to make our site come together.
