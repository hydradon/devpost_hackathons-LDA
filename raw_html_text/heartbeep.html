                </h1>
                <p>
                    Android Application targeted towards benefiting the elderly amongst other potential demographics. Inspired by the real life experience of one of our contributors, whose grandmother was found paralyzed on the floor of her single bedroom apartment 3 days after she had an unfortunate fall. The thought of a loved one being alone and terrified for such a long time not knowing if help would be on its way is a horrifying thought. HeartBeep looks to abolish any such possibilities and make sure no one ever has to experience such an ordeal in their lifetime. HeartBeep has a timer that resets every time the user opens their mobile device. If the device has not been interacted with after a user set interval of time, our servers will push out an SMS Emergency Alert to emergency contacts provided by the user so that his friends and family will know he needs assistance. HeartBeep is by NO MEANS an emergency system, but rather is meant to give users a fighting chance in an otherwise unfavorable situation. We truly hope our service helps reduce tragic occurrences and brings comfort and reassurance to all our users.
