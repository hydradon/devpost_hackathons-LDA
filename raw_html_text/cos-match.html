                    Our inspiration to build this project came about from our own struggles. Online shopping is convenient, however there is a lot more that can be added to it to make it better. A few days ago my teammates and I had an event to attend and while we were doing our makeup we noticed one of the foundations we bought was about 2 shades darker than our skin tone. We could not return it after we had already bought it, hence our money was wasted. Cos-match was our solution to enhance online shopping, for cosmetics, and especially to save money.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our vision was that the app could operate like any other shopping app, except it would have the ability to scan ones' facial features using complex algorithms and AR technology, as well as match a shade which fits just right for the individual.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We went ahead to include other aspects of makeup such as lipstick, concealer etc, to allow the user  to purchase an entire makeup set. The user would be able to try different sets of makeup as well as see what the makeup would look like on them, contrary to the traditional way of only seeing it on the models. The user would also be able to customize their search, compare prices across different products, as well as individualize their search for makeup using a quiz format find the idea product for each person.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our app was meant to simplify women's lives especially, but also it is a great way to help men as well; for example a user might want to buy a present for someone especially with the holidays seasons coming in, they would be able to upload a picture of the person and manipulate it with the various makeup sets so they know exactly what to buy, without the fear of the other person not being able to wear it because of buying a wrong shade.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All in all Cos-Match, is a wonderful app that would solve a huge problem for multiple women worldwide.
