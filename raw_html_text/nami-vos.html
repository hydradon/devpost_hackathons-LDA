                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mental Illness is a very serious problem, that affects many people around us. Building an efficient data management system for the National Alliance of Mental Illness will allow them to focus on helping more people in need, instead of tracking down tedious paperwork and excel sheets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    NAMI-VOS is a data management portal for National Alliance of Mental Health to manage their volunteers, donations, program participants, and community members. It provides a centralized, secure, and convenient system for submitting, tracking, and analyzing data that is critical to NAMI's efficiency as an organization.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used NodesJS with a PostgreSQL database, Redis for sessions, Bootstrap for style, and jQuery for UI functionality. 
The application is also secured with Bcrypt password hashing, encrypted session cookies, input sanitation/validation and AES 256 sensitive data encryption. The live demo is hosted on Heroku.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting started with a new project is always fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    Hopefully it will make an impact on the National Alliance of Mental Illness and help them help more people in need.
