                    I was looking forward to Dub Hacks but recently fell very sick, and decided I was probably too sick to stay up all night &amp; didn't want to spread my nasty cold to others, however I still wanted to do something. As a pretty inexperienced programmer, I decided just to do one of the random projects by myself that my professor recommended doing after I finished 143; a calculator. But since halloween is coming up, I decided to give mine a bit of a spooky twist. I built it using Swing in Java. I have only ever made one other GUI so I definitely improved my GUI skills with this one. Some challenges were that I had trouble figuring out how to make the gif play, but eventually got it to work by a having it be a pop up window. I also spent 2 hours trying to get the pop up window to play the ghostbusters theme song, but I could not for the life of me get it to work. Overall, I definitely improved my java and GUI skills. If I were to continue working on Haunted Calculator, I'd definitely want to make it more visually appealing,  get the music working, and make it an actual functional calculator.
