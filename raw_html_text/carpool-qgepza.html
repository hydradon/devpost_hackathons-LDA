                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to the heavy traffic we see in big cities, with most cars being occupied by one person, we decided to create a simple ridesharing service. Our service is decentralized, so users don't pay us directly, and anyone can be a driver.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows users to either be drivers or be driven by other people, similar to Uber or Lyft, but more decentralized. The idea was to earn credit by driving others, which can be used for free rides from other drivers later on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Node.js for the server backend, Firebase for the database, Google Maps API to handle viewing location, and Handlebars.js, CSS, and vanilla JS for the front end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with Firebase and the Google Maps API was very difficult. The team was also mostly beginners, so we all made sure everyone was up to speed on what was happening.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite the inexperience of the front end team, we were able to create a decent user interface, with a navigation bar and animations. Since databases were very challenging, getting those to work with the rest of the application was a big milestone in our development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work with basic HTML, CSS, and client-side Javascript components, along with server-side JS, how to work with Firebase and Google Maps API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Carpool
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were not able to implement all of our planned features, such as a credit system for drivers and riders, querying drivers based on location and destination, Google sign-in, and a better user interface. After those implementations, the next step would be to properly deploy the app and also port it over to mobile to allow users to use our application anywhere.
