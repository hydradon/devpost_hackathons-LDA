                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to bridge communities, bring them together on one discussion table to talk and debate, regardless of their language or distance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows people to talk to each other and discuss any topic in their own language inside Facebook, utilizing its massive user base.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a combination of advanced technology, like machine-driven conversations, natural language processing and automatic language detection to build a smart bot on top of Facebook's messenger platform, where Facebook messenger is accessible on any device wether it was a mobile or a desktop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We needed to come up with an idea that literally defines the word "bridging communities", and we had to come up with multiple idea iterations to reach the final product we now have.
One of the most challenging issues was the very limited time we were given.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Reaching a stable release in a very short time, with a team that never met before, and overcame all the obstacles and worked hard toward one goal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot, we learned that ideas are cheap, but the implementation is most expensive.

                <h2>
                    What's next for SharqBot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We see SharqBot as a big community of people from different backgrounds/languages, however, the bot is planned to be your go-to "facilitator" when you want to discuss what matters to you with people from around the world, not only on Facebook, but also on any instant messaging platforms like WeChat, Line, Telegram, or WhatsApp (when they allow it).
