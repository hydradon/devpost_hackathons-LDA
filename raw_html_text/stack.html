                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Seeing beginner programmers struggling to understand and visualize the relationship between the stack and heap in memory.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Stack++ gives you an IDE-like environment to allow you to see how the stack and heap interact while debugging your code line-by-line.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We separated the front-end UI and the backend business logic by splitting the work between our group of four. In teams of two, we worked on both ends while always ensuring that we had the same interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although we tried keeping the same interface as best as we could, working in separate teams on both ends made it a little more difficult for us to maintain the same interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to successfully create an Object Oriented back end logic that was fully functional and tested. This allowed us to take in many lines of code and represent them in a dynamic and user friendly environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working in a team and staying coordinated with 4 people at once it difficult and can cause some issues when we aren't all on the same page. This hackathon gave us a lot of experience working without a plan and having to fix errors and problems on the spot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Stack++
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For now our program only works with primatives and basic objects like strings. Our next steps with this project is to allow it to work with objects, in order to show how an objects interact with the stack, and add methods, allowing the program to demonstrate recursive problems in the stack.
