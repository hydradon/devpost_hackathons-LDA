                    Problem
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Food insecurity and soil loss are gnarly global problems. Putting a price on soil carbon and incentivizing farmers to build soil are clear solutions, but existing carbon markets are inefficient/costly/opaque, and building soil takes time to pay off for farmers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Solution
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our product is a decentralized exchange for soil organic matter/soil carbon. 
Soil is tokenized through an Ethereum blockchain protocol so that one token or &ldquo;SOM&rdquo; represents one ton of soil carbon. Landowners who have verified carbon credits for avoided grasslands conversion projects or other future compliance mechanisms, can put their credits into our exchange as a bond-like sustainable investment rather than selling their credits for fiat currency, in which case they would be retired, or more likely, &ldquo;burned&rdquo; by a company needing to comply on offsets for atmospheric CO2 releases.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An investor in our SOM reserve must hold their tokens for a minimum of three years, after which their investment begins to appreciate in value until it matures in 10 years at a set range.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the other side of the SOM coin are farmers who need to build soil organic matter to produce food, or comply with a "green" mandate imposed by a government entity. They may be forwarded a &ldquo;loan&rdquo; from the reserve to pay for approved soil-building inputs and time lag to productivity. As their soil carbon accumulates they must re-tokenize it in SOM. Adding this new tokenized soil carbon into the reserve raises the market cap of SOMcoin.
                </p>
