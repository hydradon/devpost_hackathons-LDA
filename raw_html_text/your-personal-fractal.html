                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by seeing the artistic beauty of complex algebra.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project takes information about a person and generates for them a unique personal fractal with varying colours and shapes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using basic html, css, and javascript using canvas with p5.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into lots of mathematical problems. For example, we had problems with manipulation of the Mandelbrot set and also varying the designs using the sha256 hashes. As well as that, we programmed on a Mac, which we had never done before. It was also extremely hard to finish the work itself due to us being sleep deprived from writing the Google Code Jam the day before
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to create really cool unique images. We solved lots of math problems and also had lots of fun with being able to manipulate equations to produce cool results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about fractals during this project and in particular a lot about the Mandelbrot set. We came up with many ways to vary the formulas we wrote in order to manipulate the sets in certain ways. We also learned a lot about structuring our javascript and writing organized code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Your Personal Fractal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to come up with ways to use it in terms of security, such as passwords etc. We also want to come up with different rules for the fractals to vary the images produced.
