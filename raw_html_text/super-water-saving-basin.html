                    "Every other policy had to bend at the knees for our water survival." This quote by the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew at the inaugural Singapore International Water Week dialogue in 2008 serves to emphasize the importance of clean drinking water to Singapore's economic and physical survival. With the 30% increase in water tariffs, it further reinforces the point.

                    This emphasis also forms the foundation of our project, the Super Water Saving Basin+, which aims to revolutionize water conservation in the kitchens of our people. The amalgamation of automation via Arduino technology and the simplicity of good design, our adjustable basin will effectively help to cut water consumption in kitchens everywhere.
