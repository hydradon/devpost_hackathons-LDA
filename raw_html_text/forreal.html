                    ** In an ever partisan society, misinformed opinions and information is a product of fake news spread through social media and other breaking news platform. We were inspired to create this tool as we understand the importance and the difference that can be made when societies are well informed; there's less conflict, less frustration and overall, people make better constructed decisions. Forreal is a Chrome extension that combats fake news by suggesting more relevant and trusted sources for news.

                <p>
                    This project was our introduction to web development and producing a Chrome extension. Throughout, we had to familiarize ourselves with the News API and techniques for styling the app to be intuitive and simple. This project was a great learning opportunity as we struggled with many obstacles including finicky CSS styling, formatting JSON files from an external API fetch request and designing an algorithm to detect keywords in a user's phrase.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Obviously we could not implement all the features we had intended but hope to design them in weeks to come. Specifically we'd like to simplify the user experience by allowing the user to highlight phrases directly and search for news articles without having to copy and paste. In addition, we mainly relied on NewsAPI's relevancy sorting method but wanted to incorporate an ML model that judges the trustworthiness of the source.

                    Overall, DeltaHacks was an amazing learning experience and inspired us to create change through programming. #Forreal **
