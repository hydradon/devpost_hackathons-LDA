                    As we enter into industry, our professional network is a large predictor of our future success. We attend many events, such as Career Fairs, Conferences and the like, but are often unaware of just who else is in the room around us. Ntwrk is an app that uses LinkedIn to help you continually grow our professional network by displaying the profiles of those around you at events and places. Although Ntwrk started as a networking tool, it has humongous future growth potential. It can be utilized to meet people with similiar interests at airports/ on your plane, and can even be used by first responders in catastrophic situations to see who all were in the area of impact and to assure their safety.
