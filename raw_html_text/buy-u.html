                    We're two young '19s who don't know what a back-end is.
                    <em>
                        This is our story
                    </em>

                    <strong>
                        We wanted to build an online marketplace -- free, open, and easy to use -- for Dartmouth students
                    </strong>
                    They could buy and sell anything they wanted. Zero overhead. Zero transportation costs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since Venmo has closed down its developer API, we cannot currently implement it. However, we provide the necessary  information for both people to Venmo each other for the purpose.

                    We used Firebase as a back-end, and it kind of works. You can kind of add items, you can definitely add users (exciting!), and you can absolutely navigate to a single longboard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With user functionality, the ability to create item postings, there are just a few more things we need to reach full functionality.
