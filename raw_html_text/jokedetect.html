                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted something entertaining that is also impressive

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The neural network is trained on the transcription and the intonation, and based on those, it tries to figure out if something is a joke or not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use Microsoft Cognitive Services for speech to text and Tensorflow + Keras for the neural network.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up Cognitive Services API.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recognizing a joke is very hard for a computer, and we're surprised and impressed that we got close to that.
                </p>

                    What we learned

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could have a crowd analysis that detects whether or not a joke was good, based on the reaction of the audience,
