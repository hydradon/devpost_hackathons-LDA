                    GCU IxT is an information and technologies club and team that seeks to assist with all and any IT, Computer Science, Programming and Engineering problems. GCU recognizes our love of animals. From the cows outside of 33rd Ave garage to the cats of GCU, we love our animals and strive to make their lives better as they make us feel at home without being at home. They are apart of our home at GCU and our lives.
