                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was inspired by Leon's father's first-hand experience with a lack of electronic medical records and realizing the need for more accessible patient experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The system stores patients' medical records. it also allows patients to fill out medical forms using their voice, as well as electronically sign using their voice as well. Our theme while building it was accessibility, hence the voice control integration, simple and easy to understand UI, and big, bold colours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front end is built on react-native, while the background is built in node.js using MongoDB Atlas as our database. For our speed to text processing, we used the Google Cloud Platform. We also used Twilio for our SMS reminder component.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are three distinct challenges that we ran into. The first was trying to get Twilio to function correctly within the app. We were trying to use it on the frontend but due to the nature of react native, and some node.js libraries that were being used, it was not working. We solved the problem by deploying to a Heroku serving and making REST calls.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A second challenge was trying to get the database queries to work from our backend. Although everything seems right it still did not work but to do attention to detail, and going over code multiple times, the mistake was spotted and corrected.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The third and likely biggest challenge we faced was getting the speech to text streaming input to co-operate. In the beginning, it did not stop recording at the correct times and would capture a lot of noise from the background. This problem was eventually solved by redoing it by following a tutorial online.

                    </strong>
                    We honestly did not expect to finish if you asked us at 10 pm on Saturday night. However, things came through well which we were really proud of. We are also really proud of our UI/UX and think it is a very sleek and clean design. Two other things include accurate speech to text processing and dynamically filled values through our database at runtime.

                <p>
                    If we were to continue to work on this project, we would first start by dynamically filling all values through our database. We would then focus a lot of attention on security as medical records are sensitive info. Thirdly, we would upgrade the UI/UX to be even better than before.
