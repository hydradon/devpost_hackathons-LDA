                    Purpose: Virtual PC Assistant - Kiddo is developed to help any individual do the common chores as well as entertain in much easier and modern way. Your personal PC assistant comes in two mode - Speech and Text. You can interact in either way - through your melodious voice or through your mobile when you run a sore throat.
Imagine waking up one lazy Saturday morning. How do you want to start your day? Perhaps sleep again?
Well, our specially designed assistant can play you a right music from your music library (depending on your mood) on one go. Kiddo can update you with the temperature outside so that you have the right clothes for your brisk walk. What more?Your personalized PC assistant can update you with current twitter hashtag trends or simply keep you in conversation if you are feeling too low. Clocks not working? Well, Kiddo has got you covered. Just ask for time and your assistant will update you right away. Busy person? Kiddo can synchronize with your Google Calendar and help you plan out your entire year.. or perhaps a week if you are a student like me. Can you ask for more? Totally yea! Kiddo comes with built in games (text mode) to keep you going when your best friend went for a week vacation. Did I mention that Kiddo can read out your horoscope to you?
