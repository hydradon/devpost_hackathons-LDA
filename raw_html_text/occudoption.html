                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As humans, it is within our nature to want to be cared for, to be loved. What we do not sometimes realize is that several other living beings share this desire; animals that have been neglected and do not have a home. As a team, we wanted to create a revolutionary way for users to find and interact with their perfect future companion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users get access to a database of different animals and their characteristics. Clicking on the interface allows them to interact with a simulator of a specific animal via Oculus Rift, from the comfort of one's own home. Then, based on this unique user interaction and the characteristics of the animal, users decide if they want to "swipe right" (i.e. choose said animal for adoption) or "swipe left" (i.e. see the next available selection).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the back-end, we used mostly C# to create code that would run on Unity, along with setting up one database using SQL.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mostly trying to set up a VR aspect using the Oculus Rift, so as to allow the user to directly interact with the simulation.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to program in C# and using Unity pretty much from scratch! Furthermore, setting up a database on SQL was not as difficult as it seemed to be.
                </p>

                    What we learned

                    Anything is possible when you put your mind to it!
