                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While preparing and organizing our trip to Bremen we had a lot of problems with finding the most convenient path, we used lots of flights search engines and there was always some missing features that we needed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It helps travelers to find the best and optimal route, in both budget and time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Firebase for the authentication, Django Framework for the backend, SkyScanner API, ML algorithms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting familiar with the SkyScanner API.
We are only two persons in the team. 
Time is too short to discover and use the API and for implementing our frontend mockup.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding new features that don't currently exist such as: finding the cheapest or shortest route using smart layovers, choosing the optimal itinerary by first specifying the destination and then the application will list all possible departure points.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To Use SkyScanner AP.

                    Finishing the implementation of all the features.
