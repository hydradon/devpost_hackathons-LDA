                <p>
                    We were inspired to do this project because we always feel that the custom retail experience can always be smoothed in any way shape or form.  More than half the time, people see clothes that they like not in stores but on other people wearing them.

                    SnapShop allows you to upload a picture you have taken of some article of clothing and analyzes it, returning links to where you can buy clothes similar in style or of the same brand

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the front-end using bootstrap while the back-end was mostly node.js and PHP.  The way it works is by analyzing logo and label characteristics of a photo uploaded using Google Vision API, which is then written in a JSON file and read by Google's Custom Search Engine API which we have tailored to parse through different clothing brand sites

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into were heavily based around writing and reading to a JSON file using PHP.  We also encountered issues communicating between our JS files and our PHP files.

                <p>
                    The front end is super user friendly it looks great.  All the functionalities of the app work perfectly and the UI looks good.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to program in PHP as well as incorporate Google's Custom Search Engine API.  We also learned how to parse through JSON files after written and read.  We also ways in order to avoid merge conflicts when possible.

                <p>
                    We hope to get this visual shopping expanded into other markets and industries, other than the clothing one.  Our next main focus is groceries and returning closest locations of stores and cheapest prices when pictures of food or ingredients are uploaded.
