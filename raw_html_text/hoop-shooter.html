                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First we wanted to do a website, then we considered doing a virtual classroom. But we ultimately chose to do a basketball shooter simulator. What inspired us to do this particular project was the technology called leap motion and the Oculus Rift. When we saw that they were provided by the hackathon we were fascinate with the potential of VR and leap motion technology since none of us had ever used them before.In the end we saw a challenge and were ready to take it on.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's basically a very simple basketball shooter.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it by using a free 3D model for the hoop from the link at the end and the rest we built by using the asset store in unity. We also create invisible colliers so that when the ball hits the hoop it reacts properly. Also we used the built in technologies of the Oculus Rift and Leap Motion.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the challenges we ran into were having the ball re-spawn after it had been shot. Another one was creating  a score tracker that showed up in the VR headset view. Another one was creating a hole for the ball to go through so it looked like you made a basket. Out of these we were only able to overcome one challenge which was the create a hole for the basket.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the accomplishments that we are proud of is the fact that we were able to get the leap motion and oculus rift technologies to work together as well as being able to pick up a ball and throw it into the hoop.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the oculus rift as well as the leap motion technologies to track and pick up items as well as knowledge about how to create and build a VR game in unity
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hoop Shooter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are many possible roads for Hoop Shooter to take but the most promising one is probably implementing a score board with sounds to make it feel like you are in a real shoot out at an NBA event.
