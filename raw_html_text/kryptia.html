                        KRYPTIA
                    </strong>
                    is a multiplayer competitive educational game for Android or IOS in which participants challenge each other to prove who is the one able to decipher hidden words quicker. The game allows the player to compete in Challenging Duels (1 vs 1) or participate in Grand Challenges (All vs All). This last one has an &ldquo;Educational Challenge&rdquo;, which allows a teacher to take control of a Grand Challenge mode, making children from the same class or school compete with each other under their teacher&rsquo;s supervision.
                    <strong>
                        This works as a tool that empowers teachers  that want to introduce cybersecurity and cyphration to children in a fun and proactive way.

                <p>
                    The objective of the game is to get the higher\st amount of points. When in a game, KRYPTIA will show the same 10 different questions to the users that are competing. Depending on the time needed to correctly answer each question, the times that you answered them wrong, and the position respect other users to answer each question, users will get more points. After everybody has answered all questions, points are displayed and winner (a podium of 3) is declared.

                    You are a interstellar traveller in a world where something called Earth is the last turistic call. But there is a problem: as people from all over the galaxy gather there, nobody understands anybody. So, in order to understand what they are saying from this extremely interesting place called &ldquo;Earth&rdquo;, you need to decipher what they are saying! Gather some friends to join you in this planet, and try to find out who is the quicker decypher.
