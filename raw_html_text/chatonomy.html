                    Our inspiration is the lack of wanting to give numbers to people we may never see again, but have to communicate with to get things like school projects done.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our application allows groups to send anonymous messages together without requiring the need of exchanging phone numbers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built it by integrating Node.js, Twilio, Javascript, and Google Cloud together into our project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Integrating the APIs into our project and getting the networking set up to gain the ability to distribute messages across our test number were two of our toughest challenges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We accomplished a flexible structure for our project that we will easily improve upon later.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We went _ very _ far out of our comfort zone and learned a new language, programming style, platform, and environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are going to improve upon our code and continuously add more functionality to the project in the future.
