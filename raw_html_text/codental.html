                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to enrich low-income individuals by providing knowledge to help take care of their oral hygiene, understand their dental symptoms, and provide options for low-cost dental treatment.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application will take the users input of personal information(Name, Age, Gender) and will answer a series of questions about their oral health. Based on the answers the user provided, the application will provide links that will educate them on the symptoms they provided and suggest to seek dental professional treatment. This will also give options to low-cost treatments to patients who do not have dental insurance.
                </p>

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    Program the routes in python using Visual Studio that will first take the data and call the functions to the services(also in python). The services then return the data to the routes created, which will then return to the front-end that was built with javascript and react-native.
