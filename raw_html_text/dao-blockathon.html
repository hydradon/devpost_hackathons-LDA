The disconnect between the funding organization and their beneficiaries leads to charity scenario thus the youth are not encouraged to view the bigger picture and partake a proactive and creative process in the global digital space.

                    Cryptopreneurship is an art form, it's a very weird way to combine the tech and social situations. The gap between us privileged Ethereans to youth in challenging conditions is really big.
