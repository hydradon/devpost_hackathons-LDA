                    Inspiration: Information gone viral resonated with me as I remember following a trend in high school. My friends and I would look up compilations of childhood songs and compete to figure out what it does.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: Understanding the process between front end and back end servers. We learned a lot more about various website apis. We have all developed a better sense of how to learn about coding overall.

                    What we learned: How to better manage our time and overall coding. None of us knew much about coding the stuff we wanted to do till today. Shoutout to Kevin for being such a great help
