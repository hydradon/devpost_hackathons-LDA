                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    US_Foodborne_Disease_Cost_2018 = 4.8 billion dollars.
FDA has an open source data for food recall and contamination.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We trained a camera to identify food to a category and pull out food recall data and nutrition facts from FDA open source API.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python and Swift as our main coding language. We built an API running to store the whole database that we got and takes GET request from our terminal (App users) requesting information regarding to the food picture; we also incorporated a rating system to rate the recall risk and the nutrition of the certain food type.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to get familiar with Swift and design the GUI interface with the users. We also found out that the food nutrition often requires authentication to be accessed, thus another idea is to gather crowd-sourced data to provide free and openly accessible food nutrition data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created an API server that we can put in a request for food type and return to us in Json dictionaries food nutrition information and recent recall histories related.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create API server and use Xcode to create simple iPhone Applications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Food Alert
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can design specific apps targetting some diseases and advise on them what to consume or not.
