                    Generating music using Electromyography (EMG) data. Basically making your muscles do the heavy lifting for you ;).

                    Created during HackIllinois 2017, Musicles was designed to allow the creators to understand JavaScript and use a webapp to play music from a Myo band. The Myo band is an EMG based arm- band

                    Rehabilitation, especially upper arm rehab takes quite a lot of monitoring, in particular for caregivers and doctors. It's also quite frustrating for the individuals themselves. While there are tons of game based rehab systems out there, we wanted to explore options for the musically inclined. :musical_note:

                    The current implementation of the library uses the strength applied by the user to control the tone of the music being produced :musical_keyboard:. The position of the hand to control the volume. 
Flex your forearms and hear the sweet sounds of your arms.
