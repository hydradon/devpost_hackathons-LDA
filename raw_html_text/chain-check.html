                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think that global supply chain tracking is one of the most interesting applications for NB-IoT technology. Low-cost connectivity and the native functionality offered by the components of the NB-IoT dev kits offer the opportunity to report data on the condition of goods in transit. This information can be used to launch immediate responses when refrigeration systems fail, or other difficulties are encountered in the global supply chain.

                    We built a device which collects and reports GPS, temperature, humidity, and tilt information to our database. We also built a dashboard with a mapping interface to display the last reported location of all of our deployed devices, as well as time series data from historical measurements. The goal is to offer intuitive tracking information, and more importantly to automatically notify those who can intervene to resolve situations where environmental conditions put shipments at risk.
