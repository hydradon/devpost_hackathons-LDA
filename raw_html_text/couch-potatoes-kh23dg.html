                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's a specific factor of compatibility that is often overlooked when meeting and dating people. This factor may very well have a significant impact on the dynamics of any relationship. Often times, we don't give much thought to the type of media content that we consume on a daily basis and how it says a lot about us and our personalities. Whether we like it or not, the movies and shows that we consume on a regular basis have an impact on our outlook and attitude on life. This is why it is crucial to consider this when in the market for a new relationship. Imagine investing time and energy into a person who, pop culturally speaking, is on a completely different wavelength as you. Have no fear, because Couch Potatoes is here! Couch Potatoes is an innovative dating website that will "mash" you up with people around you who share the same interests when it comes to shows, movies, and media content. Our website's complex algorithm will help build better relationships because there won't be any conflict when picking what to watch when staying in at the house.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, a dating website that matches users based on what&rsquo;s really important in life. You know, that Sunday evening season premiere you&rsquo;ve waited for approximately 18 months, 47 days, 16 hours, and 22 minutes to see. We match users based on the content they watch from various platforms. Unlike other dating apps and websites, we decided to display a list of potential matches based on our complex algorithm. Users may toggle through the list which will descend from high to low based off compatibility. 
Using Wix Code&rsquo;s powerful website building platform we have assembled a simplistic product for users. Implementing various API&rsquo;s within the Wix Code library we were able to extract user locations and image retrieval based on keywords.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our team faced many challenges. Although being our first project, we decided to dive into this idea with zero knowledge of Wix Code, Javascript, or NodeJS. The first hurdle was extracting the user&rsquo;s location with a built-in API and transcribing the data into our records, which we used later to acquire the range of potential matches. Then came the algorithm we would implement to match our users. Creating multiple Boolean functions to weave out unwanted users.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The destination may be an achievement for most. But for our team, the journey and hurdles we overcame drastically outweigh the finished product. Team building and communication was huge for us, as we had to discuss aloud, share ideas, and collaborate our minds to reach outstanding solutions such as the matching algorithm

                    Team building, communication, and problem-solving are atop of the list of things we improved in working on this project. As a team, we were able to locate a compatibility problem and come up with a promising solution. Also, the rough introduction into Javascript and Wix Code. Troubleshooting and decoding was another huge new insight for us and we definitely see the importance in these areas.

                    After perfecting the website on the front and back ends, we plan on extending the usability to the app market. Also, work on obtaining more API's and different scope of data to improve the compatibility match algorithm. i.e. accounting for minutes spent watching a specific piece of content and comparing that with other users.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inspiration for Couch Potatoes emerged from the idea of creating a platform for connecting people with those around them, according to their common interests. Our team consists of a diverse set of individuals from different walks of life. Although we all come from different places, we all share a common interest in creating and we have ultimately combined our various skills to create something from scratch that we are all proud of. We look forward to continuing on enhancing Couch Potatoes after ShellHacks. After perfecting the website on the front and back ends, we plan on extending the usability to the app market.
