                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Last Christmas we decided to make a donation instead of giving presents to each other. So we started the research. Since we didn't intend to donate a fortune, we wanted to be sure that we reach the beneficiary - a person, a village, an animal in need - not a western organization which might wastes most of the money for adverts or administration. So we ran into the question: How can we really know? We failed to find a reliable and trustworthy solution. Always when we mentioned this issue to our friends and collegues we got the same answers. When we find something like this, they would definitely donate too, but so far the distrust is just too big.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So a huge problem of charity-organizations is that people are pessimistic about where their money goes and what it's used for. The organizations are trying to give transparency with blog-posts, photos and a webpage and descriptions... but still, you never really know...
                </p>
                <p>
                    We connect the charity-world to the blockchain-concept. The closer the donation gets to the beneficiary, the clearer the benefector knows the real value of his/ her donation. With an up-to-date IT-Process we want to disrupt the common/ current charity-system and bring clarity to charity ,

                    Chario provides a solution-system to manage your donation-tracking along the Charity-Chain. Charity-Agents who receive your donation and send it further use
With this we Via this they can easily provide information to a central program. There the benefactor can see where the money, deed or good is and goes.

                    During the last 24 hours we developed an Android App for the Agents, a Webservice for the benefactors and a Database where both applications work with.
