                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all enjoy using discord and think it's a cool platform.  We wanted a way to expand on its functionality in a way that hasn't been done by any other bot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our bot can join a voice channel in discord and individually run speech recognition on each user in the channel.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a dev fork of a popular discord api library and modified it to allow the functionality we needed.  The PCM data packets are then strreamed to google cloud services speech to text api for analysis.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to explore both voice command functionality, as well as the possibility to transcribe audio for deaf users.  Given that each person in the voice channel is analyzed separately, it's very feasible to make a person-by-person live transcription of any conversation that takes place in a voice channel,
