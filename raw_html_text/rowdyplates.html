                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If the government can do it how hard can it be
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It has the ability to read and save information from license plates in real time and can pull meaningful correlations from the data
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through hosting on a rapspberry pi and extensive python and nodejs libraries
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    finding a good machine learning platform that accurately and reliably pulls data from images but thanks to my man Matt Hill who apparently single handedly developed and maintained openalpr; the best license plate recognition software in the game
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    reaching the goals that we set out to accomplish
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    never use nodejs, if an api is over 3 years old just don't do it even if it looks so good, dont subprocess what you can thread, also don't sub process never ending loops
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RowdyPlates
                </h2>
                <p>
                    hopefully getting eyed by some three letter agencies
                </p>
