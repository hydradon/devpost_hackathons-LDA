                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Whenever I sign up for accounts to play video games, my friends and I try to come up with creative usernames.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We each tried to come up with 3 creative domain names
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We went to domain.com through the link provided on the domain.com business card. We then each came up with creative domain names. The next step was to confirm the domain name and enter the discount code. Afterwards we filled personal information and credit card information. We then verified email and had to get past tough security checks. Afterwards, we were able to claim the domain names.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into security checks that would have required 24 hours to resolve due to that being the amount of time needed before an employee could manually verify the domain to be legit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were glad that we didn't have to wait the full 24 hours to have an employee perform verification check. We were able to figure out that calling their billing department would speed up for the process. We were able to get the domain names registered instantly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that not all problems require the amount of time stated to solve them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for I like raspberry pies
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step would clearly be to finish hosting those domains and convert them into function and awesome websites that people will try to go to due to their amazing names.
