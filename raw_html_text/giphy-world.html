                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this project came from one of our teammates, when they got embarrassed at work over the summer when their seemingly innocent searches for gifs on slack resulted in a few too many NSFW results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project acts as a filter between the user and the giphy search engine. Users provide our website with the query they are looking for, and we issue the query and assess its 'safe for workness' using Azure's adult and racy content detection system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was built using Python to access the REST API's of both Giphy and Azure. The project is hosted on a CentOS system running on an Azure virtual machine. The project is accessible via html or rest api.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During the hackathon, our team pivoted a
                    <strong>
                        lot
                    </strong>
                    . We came to the hackathon with a few great ideas, but noticed that we did not have the skill set to properly execute them, mainly front end development skills. After pivoting, we looked into many of the API's offered throughout the competition, testing out many and encountering many unexpected pitfalls.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team is proud of our final project. It was the first time the three of us had come together and built something like this together, and in such a short time period.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team learned the importance of thorough documentation. Throughout the competition, we fell victim to poor documentation many times. We also learned the importance of a diverse team, with each member specializing in a different aspect of development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Giphy World
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The future of Giphy could go in many directions. The filter incorporate other systems such as Detectron by Facebook, to more intelligently filter out NSFW content. In addition, a plugin for apps will be made, allowing developers access to our SFW filter. Lastly, integration with Slack is critical to prevent our team member from having any more embarrassing moments looking for gifs at work.
