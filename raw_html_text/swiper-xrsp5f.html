                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What started as a hackathon revolving around the bassoon, pivoted into one focused around removing the redundancy of signing into repeatable events
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right now, it doesn't do much of anything besides allow a student to build up their profile. There is a lot more in the works
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right now, using MeteorJS and associated plugins. Eventually will throw in the Google and Facebook Events API as well as using an Arduino with a card scanner.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>

                    Check us out some time
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Perhaps this idea in the near future, the project was short for a hackathon but begs to be executed later down the line.
