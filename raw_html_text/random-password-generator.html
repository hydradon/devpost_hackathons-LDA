                    The new Ransomware that had been released into the world got us thinking on how hard can we make it for hackers to get our password.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    It uses Loreum Ipsum words to created a 4 word variation with limitless possibilities, and it is highly unlikely to get the same password again. the amount of words makes it nearly impossible to breach.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    we had used HTML to create the site, CSS to design the site, and JAVASCRIPT to code the generator.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    we had ran into being able to send the password to a persons email, and we had still not been able to solve that problem.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    we had accomplished being able to get such a high variety of combinations using the Lorem Ipsum words and a 4 word combo.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    we had learned how to create small combinations using a large libraries of variables.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    we plan on using API's from different ever changing sites to create a even larger library of words to add to the combinations and make it even more impossible to breach.
