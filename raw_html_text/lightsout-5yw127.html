                <p>
                    I was talking to a friend and asked him for an idea for a useless program. He suggested a program that could tell if the lights in your house were on but would not have the ability to turn them off. That seemed a bit complicated, so I settled for mediocrity in a small FORTRAN program.

                <p>
                    It turns a light on and off.
