                    GetGrub is a mobile and web application which aims at providing busy college students with a simple means of acquiring food from various locations.  The app consists of users posting adds explaining their needs or cravings for food and other students responding to the ads and delivering food to the students.  We built this project utilizing the power of the framework Parse, which made bridging the gap between mobile and web platforms very easy.  The mobile app portion of the project was entirely written in apple's new programming language swift and the web portion was written in the classic html, css, and javascript.  One challenge our team faced was learning javascript in the first place.  Overall, we all learned a lot from this project and we are very proud of our work.  We hope you enjoy it as much as we do.
