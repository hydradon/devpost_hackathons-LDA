                    Inspiration To investigate novel applications of 5G infrastructures
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does A device containing only a display and transceiver offloads a computationally intensive task to a decentralized network of fully rigged computers
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it Tasks were parallelized using the MPI standard. Micropayments between parties involved were facilitated using the Ethereum network. Wireless modules were used to transmit various function parameters and solutions
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into Serial communication between various microcontrollers and the PC(s) itself, and establishing a reliable connection between wireless modules.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of Integration of the Ethereum network so as to showcase how IoT devices can take advantage of decentralized technologies when over-the-air data transfer rates are high enough.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned The MPI standard was new to us. We had also never before established a connection between two wireless modules.
