                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think raising public concern for climate change is extremely important and neural style transfer on images is a highly relatable way to achieve this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes a user's image and repaints it in the style of a climatic natural disaster, using style transfer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We set up a Google cloud server and a React.js app. We set up an API for the app to communicate with the server. For the style transfer part, we modified an existing approach based on feature extraction from the VGG network.
                </p>

                    <li>
                        Setting up the Google cloud server and enabling GPU support.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Compatibility issues with our style transfer optimisation script.

                    <li>
                        Setting up the flask server and the scripts for communicating with it.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up VMs servers etc can be surprisingly time-consuming.
                </p>

                    What's next for Climate gradient
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Additional features such as location-based image feeds, more natural disaster styles and improved style transfer with a feedforward neural net.
