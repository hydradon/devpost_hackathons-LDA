                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to use the Authorize API for something and Carlos from the JP Morgan team suggested creating a game through unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a 2D space shooter style game that utilizes the Authorize.net API to take in your credit card information. The goal of the game was to take money out of your account whenever you're ship deals damage to the on-coming asteroids. The card information would be provided by the player and the money would have gone to a charity they could choose from the start menu UI. The better you did the more money you would donate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the Unity game engine and wrote the scripts for everything in C#
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before this weekend, I did not know any C# nor how to use the Unity engine. I also had issues with Git hub that never really worked themselves out. Having no experience really set me back quite a bit. This was also my first time creating a UI so almost every aspect of this weekend was a learning experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm very proud of the player movement and camera follow script. The camera script is very smooth and player movement works, although not at much as I'd like. I realized that the camera script should've been changed when I changed how the player would be controlled.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a new language! At least the basics of that language, I also learned how to better google my problems and that at some point it's better to ask for help than keep googling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Money Blaster
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next for Money Blaster is to actually implement the API, fix the start menu UI, edit the camera, and implement the fire mechanics and asteroid physics.
