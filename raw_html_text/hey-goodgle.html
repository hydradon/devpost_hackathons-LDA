                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As telegram is a platform that many teenagers use these days, we decided to create a telegram bot that will help these teenagers. Taking inspiration from a korean chatting platform, Kakao Talk, we wanted to see how we can incorporate google searches into telegram such that the same platform can be used for multiple uses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a telegram bot that allows the user to search for their query directly on telegram, instead of having to switch browsers to and fro. This efficient bot will automatically send a link of the search engines (either Google, Google Scholar or Yahoo) with the query that the user has typed in. However, Goodgle requires the user to type in either 'Google', 'Google Scholar' or 'Yahoo' first, before typing in whatever they are looking to find out about.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firstly, we made a telegrambot by using Botfather. From there our group was able to get our bot token.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After that, our group made use of the pyTelegramBotAPI framework to code the Telegram Bot through Python
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we did not know how to start creating a telegram bot from scratch so that was our biggest problem. not only that, due to lack of knowledge, our ideas kept changing too.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    We are proud that we where able to code and deploy our first telegram bot.

                    What's next for Hey Goodgle
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) ) we could possibly add in location services, such that when the users are searching for perhaps nearby places to eat, Goodgle will be able to sense their location and recommend good places that are within walking distance for them to go to. 2) Instead of Goodgle sending a link, one possible change could be that it will display the top 3 results in telegram itslef, so that the users can have a more direct view of their search results. 3) We could include more links, so that telegram can be an all-in-one application that provides easy accessibility to all the popular websites
