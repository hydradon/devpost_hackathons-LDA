                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to work with Braven, a non-profit organization that partners with universities to provide low-income and first generation college students with hands-on experience in industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Programs like Braven empower first generation and low-income students. When talking to Braven representatives, our team realized that we take many life skills for granted. We have parents that have gone to college that help us edit resumes and review school essays. First generation and low-income students do not always have this luxury, and oftentimes they question their ability to succeed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I personally know many first-generation college students who have faced these same challenges and as a result failed to apply for that really cool internship, or super competitive job because they do not feel like they possess the skills or network to get the job. I am thankful and hopeful that Interview Day will help Braven continue to reach these students in a streamlined fashion, empowering them towards success.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Interview Day is a web service to organize mock-interview events in real time. The mobile-friendly website takes care of the check-in process , matches interviewees to interviewers, and provides event planners control and insight over the event.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Participant check-in: 
For security reasons, students and employers must use their registration code to sign in.
After check-in, interviewers have access to the feedback form
Admin dashboard:
Before (or even during) the event, admins can automatically match interviewees to interviewers. 
Admins can import/export a CSV for registered students and their interview details. This CSV contains a score for each student so our algorithm can match top students with VIP interviewers.
Admins can hit &ldquo;SMS details to participants&rdquo; to send each student/employer their personalized interview schedule
Admins can also send an SMS announcement at anytime to participants
The dashboard also shows other useful data such as number registered vs checked-in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The admin dashboard is the main feature that Braven wanted to incorporate. There are several buttons below the table allowing the admin to import a csv file, export the table with the schedule, generate pairs for the interviews, and a button to send SMS details to the students with their interview time, location, and a general message which the admin can edit.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this website with Ruby on Rails on the backend, and HTML5 and CSS3 front-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into several challenges throughout this project. Ruby on Rails took a long time to download and it was a new language for most of us. Fortunately, we overcame this issue because we had someone on our team that was comfortable with Ruby on Rails and helped guide us through the process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we used Ruby on Rails for this project, which was not required but was the framework that our NPO, Braven was already using. We wanted the product to be easy for their engineering team to work with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are also proud of the fact that we made our website easy and simple to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about the different frameworks that exist to create a full-stack website. We considered using Node.js with Express, and possibly React. Ultimately we ended up using Ruby on Rails. We also considered the pros and cons of using redux, react, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Interview Day
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some things that we would like to add for Interview Day that we did not incorporate at this time are:
The ability for a student to upload their resume/LinkedIn profile to the website, allowing interviewers to get to know their interviewees even before they shake their hand. 
This will be hosted on Heroku in the future to allow for ease of access and maintenance.
