                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The real world is too dynamic, so at this moment almost every person can be a content-creator. There are a lot of possibilities right now: games streaming (twitch.tv, youtube gaming), short videos/stories (instagram, facebook, etc.), life streaming, etc. But the field of news video content is still almost unreachable and it forces people to create content with the help of text-based resources. Our inspiration for current project: create a mobile studio, that will help you to create video news content and stream it to existing/custom platforms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Current application has possibility to stream video from your cameras (both front- and back-side) to existing platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Twitch (in fact, every platform, that supports RTMP streaming protocol). Besides that, application in nutshell is a audio/video mixer, thus it has possibility to show and to mix different overlays into single video stream, i.e. you have possibility to create different visual effects: running text to your viewers, make transitions, while switching cameras, demonstrate any photo from your Library, etc. to make your content better.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built
                    <strong>
                        iOS mobile application
                    </strong>
                    , that captures video from your camera, mixes it internally with other
                    <strong>
                        overlays
                    </strong>
                    , adds audio, creates H.264 frames and
                    <strong>
                        streams them
                    </strong>
                    to requested existing streaming platforms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most challenging problem for us was video mixing, due to limited and complex API, that provided by Apple.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are really proud of achieving our goals in developing news streaming application, with limited knowledge in different areas of video processing on mobile platforms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've learned that mobile platforms are capable of video mixing/processing even in complex scenarios. Besides that, we've learned that low level API, provided by Apple, is highly limited and forces you to spend a lot of time on research/workarounds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for journalugo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will try to improve our application in terms of video mixing/processing (chromakey, custom transitions, scene switching, complex overlays, picture-in-picture, etc.). We have plans to provide the core functionality of our project in form of Framework, that anyone can use. Besides that, we have plans to evolve this application into standalone broadcasting/mass media system which will be content delivery platform for independent journalists and content creators.
