                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built it on fusion API
Used ReactJS on the frontend; Node.js, Express, and MongoDB on the backend

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It initially took some time to agree upon an idea to pursue. Throughout the days we were constantly trying to refine the idea which took more time. There were some issues with accessing the developer platform so as a result we could only implement one out of the four APIs we had planned for.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built and deployed a full-stack application in 2 days. We had great UI mockups, and a great presentation. We won a prize for 'Best Team Spirit' and overall received praise from many parties associated with the Hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work in a team, how to use the FusionCloud APIs, how to ideate, create, and present a demo in 2 days, and how to answer strategic &amp; technical questions from executives.

                <p>
                    We will be recovering from the Hackathon grind and then getting together to see if we wish to continue working on our product.
