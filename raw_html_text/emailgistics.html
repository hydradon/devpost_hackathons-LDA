                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At Emailgistics, we want to solve the following problem: there is no easy way to extract analytics for decision support from shared mailboxes in Outlook. There is a white space in the workflow management and management tools available for shared mailboxes in Office 365 environments. We provide the tools necessary to add value to Office 365 shared mailboxes and enhance the user experience for the team managers and the team members. Supercharge your outlook!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Emailgistics takes your shared mailbox and customizes it. Each user can now have their own folder, set availability, and decide the maximum number of messages they want to work on at any given time. Once set up, any incoming messages will be round robin'd to each user, and as users close messages new ones will automatically be assigned. A dashboard is provided to summarize the important data about the shared mailbox: the number of open/closed messages, the number of messages assigned to each user, average reply times, available users and more!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team decided to use Golang in combination with MongoDB for the backend functionality. Furthermore, the frontend was created with Javascript, HTML/CSS and using the Vue.JS framework. The full application is hosted on Microsoft Azure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we faced was separating the application into microservices and containers using Kubernetes and serving the application on Azure using Docker.  Although this portion of the development process was a challenge it was also very necessary as it made our application extremely scalable and gave it the ability to handle a very large amount of data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are really proud of being able to use the Microsoft Graph API to create a dashboard that displays accurate information about the client's mailbox in real time. Furthermore, we are also proud to have created an efficient workflow management system that makes employees more productive and gives managers access to real-time decision support data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to integrate the Microsoft Graph API into a Golang backend efficiently and how to properly develop a scalable application. In addition, we learned how to host a web application on Azure Cloud and how to properly distribute it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Emailgistics
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right now we are working hard to ready our application for release in early September. Furthermore, we are also adding new features into the Emailgistics application such as a rules system which gives the client the ability to control where specific messages get sent to. Moreover, it will also allow the application to send out auto responses as necessary.
