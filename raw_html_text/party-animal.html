                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During college, we've seen people drink too much and just have a bad day. We want to prevent that from happening.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This device helps someone monitor how much their friends drink in the form of wristbands. When someone drinks, the DD updates that on their phone. When they reach their limit, the LEDs on their wristband light up. It helps people from drinking too much.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We cried a lot. I'm kidding, a hackathon is supposed to be fun. We built it using a few Raspberry Pi's with flask servers running on them. We connected them to LEDs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting each Pi to communicate with each other through MQTT as well as getting a flask server running so that everything worked through the internet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting MQTT setup as well as completing this project at a reasonable time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a new type of protocol. MQTT. This protocol helps keep our Pi's persistent with data. This helps the Pi update instantaneously rather than with a loop that keeps calling the data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Party Animal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If possible, we would like to improve the wiring and move away from Raspberry Pi's. We would like to reduce the resistor count from four to one. Also, we would like to switch over to Arduino's because those are more cost efficent.
                </p>
