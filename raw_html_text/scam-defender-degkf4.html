                    A browser extension that detects if the user is visiting a phishing website using machine learning and displays a warning if they are. This browser extension is hooked up with an API hosted on Google Cloud that uses a Keras model trained on the UNIMAS dataset to determine if the site is a scam.

                    Inspiration
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Every day, thousands of people are taken advantage of by internet scammers. Our team's goal was to help prevent this.

                    How we built it
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We started off by creating a design doc with all teammate agreement. We then created a trello board to keep track of tasks. We split up the duties mostly between front end, data science, and DevOps relatively evenly.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    What we learned
                </h1>
                <p>
                    DevOps is hard. Machine learning is hard. Never use Tensorflow.js under any circumstances.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Challenges we faced
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We had a lot of trouble getting the model good enough to actually be meaningful because a significant amount of our data was not in English and we had to filter this out. We also had a lot of problems hosting our API. For whatever reason, post requests stopped working for us at around 5am so we had to remake the API to use get requests.
