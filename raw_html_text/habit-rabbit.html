                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were thinking of how we could impact as many people as possible on a large scale with our three day hack. We realized the best way to impact people was to start small and build upwards. With that in mind, we thought of things that we could personally improve upon. In that moment, we looked around and noticed... We were all slouching! HOW TERRIBLE! This isn't just a one time occurrence but instead, a malicious habit that could affect us in the long term. Sometimes it is the little things that can make the biggest difference. We wanted to break bad habits, like slouching, to develop and reinforce good habits like drinking water regularly to stay hydrated. We hope that promoting good small habits amongst our users will result in them reaching for more ambitious and larger habits and goals like running a 5k or completing every homework assignment three days early (even if it was assigned 2 days early).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tracks and promotes good habits through a streak system that keeps track of how many times the user completes a habit in a row, and through visual and audible incentives. Whenever the user completes a habit, he or she is rewarded with an audible
                    <em>
                        DINK
                    </em>
                    that ignites dopamine in the brain, invokes a checkmate or smiley face on screen, and increases the legendary streak counter. However, if a user fails to maintain a habit they are punished with a tragic lost of their streak, a negative sound effect, and a X or a frown face.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built itX
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Ionic Cordova, Typescript, Angular.js, Heroku, and Firebase, we created a cross-platform mobile app that tracks habits. The user is given suggested habits and frequencies, and is allowed the to change up the habits and frequencies as needed. We primarily used Ionic Cordova, html, css, and js for front end. For back end, we used typescript and Angular.js. For our network platforms, we used Firebase and Heroku.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us have had prior experience in coding with Ionic, Firebase, and Angular.js, so it was challenging to deploy the ionic application as a Node.js frameworks application, because Heroku does not originally support Ionic builds. Also getting the server side push notifications from Firebase and local notifications to be stored was difficult because of the lack of tools to integrate Firebase to Ionic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Together we were able to design, build, and deploy an Ionic Application without any prior knowledge of the technologies we used to create it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to utilize all our resources from the mentors to youtube videos to online threads. Also we picked up new skills such as the use of Ionic Cordova, Firebase, and Heroku.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Habit Rabbit
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to take what we learned from this experience and apply it to future projects and hackathons.
