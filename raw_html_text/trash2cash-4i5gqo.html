                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With 1 million water bottles being thrown away every minute into our ocean, landfills and scattered around the globe. This will harm our environment with an alarming rate. Finastra being a FinTech company could provide means of giving incentives for each contributor of recycled water bottles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Engaging everyone who uses plastic bottles to recycle it with Trash2Cash Machines to be scattered around the most polluted cities in the Philippines(or even around the world). Anyone who puts empty bottle in the machine will get their rewards through their E-wallet generated by Trash2CAsh(an app-based incentive system). These rewards could be credited to your other E-wallets or Mobile banking accounts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For our prototype, we have used Android Studio for our mobile app. while for the other screen, we have used web ionic framework. For our presentation for the live demo, we used scrapped cardboard box to act as a Trash2Cash Water Bottle Deposit Machine

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had challenges connecting our project to the API given by the FFDC team. Also, figuring out how to demonstrate our whole process. Having a huge hardware for this idea was really challenging for the presentation.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea alone that the group were able to develop was something to be proud of. Specially living in the Philippines where most cities does not have suffice waste management program to reduce plastic pollution in each cities
