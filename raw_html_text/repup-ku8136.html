                    A lot of large software projects suffer from known issues that simply aren't being worked on - by anyone. at all. ever.
There are a few reasons for this (high effort, low reward; low visibility; unattrative tasks; ...), which realistically won't be solved by assigning random indiviuals to these issues alone.
That's where RepUp comes into play: By rewarding users for every fix they make, we encourage high amounts of participation and effort.
