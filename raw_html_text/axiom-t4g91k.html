                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In my computer science class, students often ask me to help them with their code because they can never understand what the compiler error is actually saying. Since learning from your mistakes is a great way to learn, I realized that a language with more readable compiler errors that users could learn from would allow students to pick up programming faster and will build better habits in the long run.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Axiom provides an easy to write, easy to read, and easy to fix language that is designed to be a less intimidating way for beginners to learn programming.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Axiom's interpreter is pure Python. Later, it will be made out of C and will eventually have a compiler instead of an interpreter.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to implement else statements.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I managed to get a good amount of basic features with the time that I had.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing basic features and syntax of a programming language is easier said than done.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Axiom
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I plan on implementing all of the features of a modern programming language, as well as a smarter compiler and IDE to help the student with the learning process.
