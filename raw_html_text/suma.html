                    The Problem
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users who are lending tend to want to lock in high interest rates, or at least do not want to see their interest rates fall.
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>&lt;p&gt;Conversely, borrowers want certainty over their interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to do this is to set fixed rate, fixed term loans, but these are rigid and fail to give users the full flexibility of DeFi.&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    Introducing SUMA - Secure with UMA
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>&lt;p&gt;We are introducing the proposal to create SUMA assets - assets powered by UMA Protocol that track the real value of lending &amp;amp; borrowing rates for all DeFi platforms&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    Why is this Important
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SUMA assets provide exposure to the interest rate directly on various DeFi products.
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>&lt;h3&gt;Scenario 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A user coming from CeFi to DeFi wants to place her funds in a secure, interest-bearing "checking account" with full flexibility on withdrawal. She wants to maximize return while keeping flexibility&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She visits dYdX or Compound and sees interest rates for USDC, her preferred stablecoin, at nearly 10%! She doesn't know if they will stay that way though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She then allocates a small percentage of her portfolio to hedge against the risk of the interest rate moving against her&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Additional Scenarios to be added soon!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Mechanics
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All SUMA assets in v1 will be valued according to the following formula:
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>            &lt;p style="padding-left: 2.5%"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Price = 100 - leverage ( interest rate in % )&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Thus, users can choose how much to long or short this asset to cover their portfolio needs. In scenario 1 described above, the user may decide to go create a UMA token (or use an existing one) and sell/short the token for the interest rate of her desired product and term-length, thus giving her insurance incase the interest rate decreases for her DeFi.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    Key benefits
                    <li>
                        No fixed term length on insurance - user can sell value at any time
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        User can purchase at any time/get hedged/more safe interest rates
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Can be used as a signal/tool for interest rate governance
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Conclusion
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DeFi is not easy to get into, or build on, starting from scratch. Using Torus, ENS, and UMA, we built something to allow users to go  from zero (just a gmail) to crypt0.
