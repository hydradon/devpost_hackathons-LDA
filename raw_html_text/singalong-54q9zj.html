                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever just burst into song, and wished you could effortlessly put the track on? Well your Dog Days Are Over! Singalong can recognise what you're singing, and start playing the song, all in one app!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app lets you start recording, and then you simply let loose your inner Mariah Carey. The app starts playing the song you're singing!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have a native Android app, a webapp, and a Cisco Webex chatbot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We recognise what you're singing by converting it into text, and recognising which song those lyrics belong to. Then, we track down the song, and the whole thing is just music to our ears.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building an android app turned out to be very time consuming. We also originally intended to create a Cisco Webex bot you could voice or video-call, but unfortunately Cisco has not yet developed the API for bots to access that data, so we would have to reverse-engineer the entire Webex call protocol, which we felt could take too much time away from our other work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all still standing! We also managed to split up the work to streamline our team efforts without people getting in each other's way, which was no mean feat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've gained a great deal of experience with speech recognition, app development, and not least the pain of dealing with Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing (some of you will be remembering your own experiences now).
