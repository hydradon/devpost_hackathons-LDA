                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to make the process of searching for some generic information to be automated by alexa and thus reducing the human resource involved. The additional information that rewuires human transactions are passed to the human assistant of alexa
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It makes the process of diging for data fun by making it a 6 chance guessing game
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is built using the alexa Developer console
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am very new to the amazon devolopment platform and am planning to learn it. So the project might be incomplete as of now but with suffcient manpower i would be able to employ this idea
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I managed to learn the very basics of alexa devolopment console and it seems fun
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learnt that the process of making the alexa app has be largely simplified in comparision to the actual learning algorithm implemented below the console's abstraction. I also learnt that with a good team i would be able to do what I cant do individually
