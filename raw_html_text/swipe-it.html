                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for the app came from our own observations. We noticed that at the end of the semester, some students would run out of swipes in their meal plan and resort to standing in dining halls and asking their peers to give them a swipe. Students that purchased the less costly plan would be left with no swipes while other students with the unlimited meal plan had an abundant amount of meal swipes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Swipe It allows students to either share their swipes with friends or donate anonymously to peers. It's is also a platform where students that are in need of meal swipes can accept them. This app makes sure meal swipes aren't going to waste and students aren't going hungry.
