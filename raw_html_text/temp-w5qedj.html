                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After coming across an organization known as water.org, we discovered the true extent of the crisis of millions of people across the world being unable to access clean water. We wanted to build something that helped reduce the wastage of water on a local level, starting right at home.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Knowing how much total water you consume daily is a very difficult task, and is tedious to effectively calculate. Our app, WaterSpotter, allows the user to enter data about their daily/weekly water usage. We developed a formula to calculate the severity of the user's water consumption, if they continue to use water at the rate their data provided. Therefore, WaterSpotter aims to use concepts of water use that are commonly known to give a reasonable estimate about how much water a family is consuming relative to the average household.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio and Java to create the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android Studio was a new programming venture for all of us, so it took a few hours to get acclimated to this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a very practical formula for the consumption of water that includes many factors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We went from having a very basic understanding of Android Studio functions to having a intermediate understanding of the functions.  We can probably code simple programs on our own on Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WaterSpotter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to expand our app to support different locations, with a user-provided zip-code. Based on the zipcode, the app should know the strength of the market in that area.
