                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration comes from attending lectures where the professor asks students to avoid taking notes and to put their pencils down and solely listen in order to full absorb the material. This creates a dilemma where students risk forgetting the very important material later because there is no transcript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Students can upload an audio file of the lecture and Transcribble converts it into text and then is able to highlight searched terms
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We integrated Rev.Ai into our platform to help transcribe texts and we built a website and came up with methods in JavaScript to help users search for terms on the website
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried to use AWS&rsquo;s Comprehend to help us pick put main topics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started off being a website that helps users visualize how much they are spending and where by taking pictures of their receipts, but the platform that we were using forgot to mention to is that we would be unable to use Python files, so we pivoted after 12 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned JavaScript is suboptimal as a language
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Transcribble
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on using AWS&rsquo;s Comprehend to help highlight main topics and save several files at once so that students can more easily review at the end of course.
