                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to provide help to people in need for a home as a consequence of a natural disaster.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It lets you post your message asking for help on our platform and you will be put in touch with someone as fast as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hosted our websites on firebase and we are collecting our data with natural disasters from an RSS feed. Then you can post a message if you need help and someone who wants to help you can see your request. Then, you will be mapped through phone using the twillio API
