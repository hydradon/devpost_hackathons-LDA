                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Brought to you by kids who were literally sick days before the hackathon (and Chatime). We all know tea is a warm beverage that makes you feel warm and fuzzy when you drink it and can make you feel positive! Knowing that, we wanted to be positive and help others feel the same and spread some positiviTea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Asks for some information from the user, mainly their name and their mood such as how happy they are, how sad they are, etc. The idea is to use that information we gather and recommend a tea to drink based on your emotional state of mind and along with an inspirational quote as the cherry on top. :)
