                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So we basically wanted to design an application which would solve detection of early stages of certain diseases which would aid doctors. So we found that detecting Parkinson's was perfect as it fits the bill of a disease which actually requires constant monitoring to detect the feeble changes in the tremors to detect the early onset of the disease.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would monitor the trembling of the user's phone during a phone call and measure the amount of shaking and the frequency with which we would perform analysis to determine whether the person is suffering from an early parkinson's. The values are measured based on accelerometer measurements (the sensor used).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Determining accurate thresholds for the determining of the permissible values was a big hurdle. We had to to go through multiple documents/journals to arrive at even remote information.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing of the application within the time period was a big accomplishment.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learnt about the variety of sensors available on android.

                    What's next for SegmentationFault
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Taking our disease detecting app to the next level by detecting other diseases with similar symptoms to what we have already been able to detect and to utilize more sensors to detect more variety of symptoms.
