                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am relatively new to the coding community and am always looking for new opportunities to learn! I wanted to work on developing my skills in javascript and I felt as though this would be perfectly challenging!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It makes a simple todo list. You can check each task off, and you can also delete the completed tasks.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used HTML and CSS to design and style the whole thing from scratch. The Javascript portion of this project was quite a challenge for me, but with persistence and help from the internet, I completed what I wanted to successfully!

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into a lot of different challenges in my javascript because this was my first time really digging into it and applying it. Once I started adding the javascript into the project, a lot of my styles started to get a little messy and I had to do a lot of Googling to figure out exactly what was wrong in my code and how I needed to go about solving the problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am very proud of my self for completing this project for many reasons. I coded for 22 straight hours straight with the determination to successfully complete this project that I put my mind to. This was my first time ever really using javascript to create a functioning project. I can say that that is what I am most proud of. I sat down and ground out a project that was very challenging for me but it allowed for me to see what I am capable of and what I have the potential to do moving forward. I learned a lot of things throughout these past three days, and I can say that I am very happy that I decided to participate in this event.
