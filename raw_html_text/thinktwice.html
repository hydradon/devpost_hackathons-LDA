                    It's 11:00 AM, the morning after waking up from a night of partying.  After learning that you blacked out, you quickly go to Facebook to find your friends uploaded photos of you drunk and partying for the world to see.  They didn't realize they uploaded the photos because they were drunk at the party also. We aim to prevent circumstances like this from happening by implementing an extension of Facebook- thinktwice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    thinktwice evaluates detects explicit content such as adult content or violent content on images being uploaded to Facebook.  If photos are found to be adult or violent, photos will not be uploaded for the public.
