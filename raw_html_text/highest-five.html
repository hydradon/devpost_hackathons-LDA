                    You high five someone.
The counter goes up.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the SDK set up and build process working took longer than expected.
Although we have basic high five detection, it is not robust, and we weren't able to implement a more sophisticated version.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully wrote a motion-detecting pebble app, learning a lot in the process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We enjoyed experimenting with the Pebble SDK, and although we didn't end up using it in the project, we also looked in to Rust, which is an interesting looking language.
                </p>

                    What's next for Highest Five
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ideally, we would like to continue trying to improve the detection of high fives.
