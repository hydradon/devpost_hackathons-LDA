                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first time visiting ASU and I was taken aback by the number of people using Bird Scooters in a dangerous and unsustainable manner. We wanted to provide some help for people to be able to remove the scooters from the street until they require stringent regulations and are treated like the dangerous vehicle they are.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides eager community members an avenue to reduce clutter and danger on our streets by providing a simple route to eliminate the Bird Plague
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Utilizing state of the art machine learning technology as well as the blockchain, we implemented a multitude of bitcoins. After this, we started to develop our endbird application. This was done by utilizing google cloud platform's map, direction, geolocation, and distance apis. We also utilized a github bird api that enabled us to find birds around us. With these 2 data streams we were able to create a proprietary algorithm that helps users find the most optimal solution from them, to a bird scooter, and finally, a large water source. We plan to make our product open-source soon for eager developers.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On the way to the hackathon, both of us ran into a bird that was parked illegally on the side walk. Kaustubh, even scraped his shin against one. These physical trials and tribulations provided the much needed motivation for us to pour our sweat, blood, and tears into this project.

                    We learned, that Bird really sucks.
