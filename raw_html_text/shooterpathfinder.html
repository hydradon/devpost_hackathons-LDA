                <p>
                    Using a web-based application, users can upload and tag a buildings floor plans for rooms, doorways, stairs, and exits. If there is ever an active shooter case, the building would be equipt with an audio detection system to listen for gunshots. When a shot is first fired, that room will be flagged as a shooter room, and notifications will be sent to everyone in the immediate vicinity, as well as local law enforcement. The notifications sent to normal users will direct them to the safest route out of the building

                    We are currently developing the pathfinding, and building schematic tagging process. Audio recognition is currently out of scope with the current time allowed
