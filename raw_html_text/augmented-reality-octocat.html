                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to get the most out of the weekend and decided to tackle something we had no idea about. So we choose something "Scary" like augmented reality. Mainly we just wanted to add on to the Octocat legacy!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program shows a model of an Octocat, Barbarian, etc. and makes them appear in our "reality" on a comic book cover that we've put into the system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity/Vuforia to create the models and have them appear in a laptop's camera and an Android phone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of challenges came from learning more about the controls and features of Unity. The program can be a little daunting at first because it has a lot of bells and whistles, but after a lot of study, we managed to make a small video game as well as apply what we learned to our augmented reality project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we managed to complete the project. Going into it we had strong doubts on whether we would succeed or not, but our constant effort pushed us to get the end-results we wanted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Unity, Vuforia, and 3D modeling. We did a lot of work with converting files, editing 3D models, and playing around with C# which seems to be pretty similar to Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Augmented Reality Octocat?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd like to continue with our Octocat by giving it life. Right now only our barbarian model has animation so we'd like to give our Octocat life in an Augmented Reality environment.
