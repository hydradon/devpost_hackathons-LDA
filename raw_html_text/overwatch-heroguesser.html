                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We played a lot of overwatch, and realized that we could use the if and elif statements from our calculator program to this project.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are completely new to programming, so fixing and learning syntax was a problem

                    how to use simple python functions, as well as how to make a 6 function calculator

                <p>
                    Our app could use better design on a website using CSS and HTML. We could possibly add art to it and make it an ios app.
