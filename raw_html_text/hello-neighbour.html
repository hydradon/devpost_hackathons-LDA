                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ** _ Hello Neighbor _ ** was inspired by the way that the internet connected online communities to create an app that could connect real world communities. ** _ Hello Neighbor _ ** serves as the front page for your neighborhood, allowing users to connect with those around them to look for help within the community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ** _ Hello Neighbor _ ** is a community networking app designed to strengthen the neighborhood by allowing people to share their skills to help others. Users can go through posts by a map view or by scrolling through tagged posts to see what help they can offer their neighbors. When a user sees a post by someone they can help, they are automatically directed to dialing the person's number. If you need help - your car breaks down, you need ingredients to finish dinner, or you're unable to do heavy lifting and it's move in day - all you need to do is make a post to be connected to those around you.

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    ** _ Hello Neighbor _ ** was built using Android studio, java, Firebase, and google maps API.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all were trying new things - google sign in, making an app, using Maps - that took a lot of learning by error.  Making a functional app given such a short period of time was definitely a challenge of its own. The biggest challenges we ran into were combining Firebase with Android studios, as well as google maps. As it added together things that would provide small difficulty on their own.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a functional app that has all the implementations we knew we needed for it to be successful was a very rewarding experience. We're all proud of what we learned in such a short period of time and how well it became displayed in the app. The goal of the app - to connect communities together was certainty met so we have a lot to be proud of.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use collaborate to each other's strengths as we all had different strong suits.
I learned how to make an app in Android studio and how to use google maps APIs. In Android studio, it was particularly rewarding for me to learn how to access the camera and dial from an app. I had never used Git before, but by the end of the hack I learned how to push, pull, check git status and resolve conflicts.  - Georgia
I learned how to use the newer features of Andriod studio I hadn't yet discovered in other projects. This knowledge went through the app to handle the Activity Posting Page. -Kindeep
I learnt how to combine my skills in Firebase with the Android app of my goal to create an efficient user experience.
