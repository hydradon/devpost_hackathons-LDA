                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As studious university students, the thought of timing the bus perfectly often skips our mind in favor of working on academics. This has resulted in many of us missing the bus, which can ruin plans, nights, and even entire days. Depending on the route you are on and the time of day, missing the bus could mean waiting out in the cold night with a dead phone for an additional hour. In order to end this repeated suffering many of us face, we decided to create "Don't Miss the Bus!"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Don't Miss the Bus currently does nothing.....well, it does a couple things, but not really what we want it to. Ideally, the base/simplest form of the app allows you to choose a stop at your university and provides you an option to set an alarm/notification that will notify you when the bus is one stop away.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using Android Studio and the TransLoc api. We parsed through metadata on the TransLoc website and used relevant id values to determine when to send a notification.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many challenges. Many. All of us were from widely different experience levels: Jacob, a phd student, Michael, a senior, and Enes, a sophomore. We were, however, all on the same page regarding Android Studio. We ran into issues developing the notification function, pulling html requests, creating and linking separate activity pages, and general use of Android Studio.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of developing the parsing method, creating custom classes to use the metadata from the parse, setting up the notification, and the overall progress we made in learning about and understanding Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about Android Studio, using an API, parsing through data, and a lot about mobile development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Don't Miss the Bus!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to begin with completing the original planned functionality. After that, we want to add additional features to the app such as custom settings for the notification, making the UI smoother and more aesthetically pleasing, adding a university and route selection method, and programming for edge cases.
