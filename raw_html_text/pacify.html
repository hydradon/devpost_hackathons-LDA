                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Numerous encounters with Raged gamers
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program prevents gamers from raging and helps prevent violence. The program tracks the facial emotions of the gamer. If the gamer is angry for a threshold period of time, the program pauses the game and shows the user a set of funny videos to calm them down. After the program has analyzed the new state of the user, it automatically turns off the video and returns the user back to the game.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the program using Microsoft Azure API for Facial Emotion Detection and OpenCV library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the challenges we ran into was that we were getting a 404 Error from Microsoft Azure for the API. After hours of research, we figured out how to actually get the API working and implement it to our project. Another challenge we ran into was figuring out how to keep the program running in the background and keep on detecting the facial emotions of the user.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were successfully able to use the Microsoft Azure API and OpenCV library to perform facial emotion analysis.

                <p>
                    The next thing for Pacify is we are looking to suggest the user funny videos using Deep Learning and build on iOS and Android platforms.
