                    When disaster strikes, it inevitably leaves in its wake a trail of victims. Our medical professionals are invaluable in mitigating the effects of such events, and giving them the tools to provide the best care they possibly can is of the utmost importance to us. With so many displaced, doctors have no access to vital information that could help them better aid the victims of these disasters. Our solution addressed this problem.

                    EMRtek is a sms based EMR(electronic medical record). Prior to any disaster, patients may securly upload a copy of their medical records to our website. In the event of a disaster, if the patient requires care, their attending physician may look up a lite version of their medical records via sms, using a patient pin, name and birth date. These records include basic information such as allergies, prior procedures and current prescriptions. While the medical records are readily accessible they can only be accessed in state of emergency situations when HIPAA and other privacy laws are voided.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For people who live in high risk disaster zones, they may opt to enter their personal medical information into the platform, or a doctor may upload a pdf containing the records from which only certain fields will be taken and added to the database.
                </p>

                    We hope our solution improves care for those who need it most.
