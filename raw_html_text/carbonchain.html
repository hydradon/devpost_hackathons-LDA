                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After taking organic chemistry, we found that the applications were very cumbersome and annoying to use. This will help simplify and help create a good visual element to help study. To help simplify organic chemistry molecule building.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A user inputs carbon chains like CH3CHFCHFCHFCH3 and then it will print out the line molecule version and it's IUPAC name.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coded it in python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The two of us have very little coding experience. We have a combined experience of less than a year of coding beneath us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building the basic core code behind the program. Able to print very basic molecules and give them accurate names. Even incorporated in the main halogens.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Turtle graphics and pygame.
                </p>

                    What's next for Carbonchain
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add more features to it, such as ring structures, isomers and more 3-d representation. Develop it into a web app or mobile application eventually.
