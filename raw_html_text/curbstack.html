                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hypothesis #1:
Transportation systems should be built for citizenship to facilitate physical and social mobility, not only as a consumer conveniences, as is currently the case, but as a public good; as a result, the wealth generated through the roll-out of next-gen systems/marketplaces should be built from the ground-up with equitable community re-investment mechanisms in mind, not only as an afterthought and mitigation strategy when cities push back (as is the case with uber/google/etc).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hypothesis #2:
It is only the beginning of the curb. Autonomous vehicle drop offs, last-mile systems data sharing and location hardening, auto-enforcement of parking, flying drone lanes....it's all coming. We must value the curb more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hypothesis #3:
Instead of cities being reactive to the future, they should have a seat at the table and help to build it. We need a new generation of companies, Equitable Public-Private Entities (EPPEs), to help bring this about, Curbstack aims to help spearhead this movement. We may grow a little slower, but part of equity generated should stay in the communities for re-investment at the local level.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hypothesis #4:
Cities need partners, such as CurbStack, to help them in providing the best experience possible to their citizens.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My vision for CurbStack is to create a next-gen technology suite that can help municipalities to manage and profit from city resources such as parking, sidewalks, etc and provide readily available APIs/legal/pricing models for vendors to plug into the city tech ecosystem such as Uber, Bird, Lyft, etc.

                    Currently I build 2 of 10 envisioned demos (I'm planning on continuing working on this. This was the first development session for this project ever):

                    We can turn any offline surface into an online AR portal. Play videos for posted, add checkout now buttons to ads, etc.

                    We don't need smart meters if we can make smart-license plates for free!
A Prototype of what could be possible for the future of pay for parking. Interface could be put on existing meters, car dashboard, etc....used license plate for ease of development/demo.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using swift, arkit, scnekit, and mlkit. It is a native iOS app that runs on the edge.

                    I never programmed in swift prior to this week. Monster learning curve.
