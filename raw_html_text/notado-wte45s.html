                </h2>
                <p>
                    We often ran into a problem where we wouldn't know which study area to go to for our work intent, or how many study areas were nearby. To solve this issue, we developed an interactive web page which helps us determine which study area to go to for our work intent.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web page shows all the locations of study locations within a certain radius and once the pin is selected, the rating of the study location is shown. It is also allows users to submit their own reviews on certain study locations and add new study locations to the map.
