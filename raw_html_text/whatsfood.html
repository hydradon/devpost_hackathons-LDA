                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being a super diverse group of strangers we had a great idea flow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We went through ideas ranging from financial budgeting, reinforcement learning, posture tracking, Q&amp;A bots.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Suddenly we started talking about food orders in the office and with co-workers.
                    <br>
                    There was a lot of energy around the topic we all chipped in the following problems:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Choosing a place
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Collecting everyone&rsquo;s individual orders and changes they might make
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Remind latecomers
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Placing the order manually
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Recurring (having to do the same EVERY SINGLE DAY)
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    After this it was settled, we started sketching a solution to automate the process leveraging a Chat Bot powerd by a NLP engine combined with convasational AI.

                <h2>
                    Challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was being the first WhatsApp Chatbot. They recently launched their first API.
                    <br>
                    Being disciplined to cut out great features that we all want but will have to come later because of time constraints.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It pays-off to stay super focused on the MVP, don&rsquo;t let the big features creep back in. 
Open and direct group communication make it fun and rewarding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Venturing off the beaten path and using brand new APIs without tutorials.
