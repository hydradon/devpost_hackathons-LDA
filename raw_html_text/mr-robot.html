                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mr Robot is only shows that gets hacking right. All the hacks are really close to what can be done in reality
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a simple hack that creates a conversation between Pepper (Mr. Robot) and Alexa (Darlene)

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just few lines of code

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Speech recognition from Pepper doesn't work easily
                </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How easy is to do stuff in Pepper and how more complex is to do them on Alexa, but both are fun
                </p>
