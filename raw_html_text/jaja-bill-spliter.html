                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Too many times I've seen tables of 10 people trying to split a check after the dinner with the basic calculator on the phone for 15 minutes. Other "tip calculator" apps only add and divide, which doesn't provide much functionality.
This inspired this project which is to make the best user experience for bill splitting.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes in the information of the check and tells everyone how much to pay!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of our team members were very excited about the idea despite the fact that it's the very first android app we're building. We decided to use android studio and then basically utilized google and stack-overflow to implement our vision.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding the errors in a new developing environment is very frustrating. At one point we had so much errors in the project that we had to revert it back to a previous state!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a complete and functional android app. We also showed teamwork and shared responsibilities. Before yesterday we never sat together at the same table, but we've all contributed to this project in unique and different ways. We are amazed of how much we can accomplish as a team in such a short time.

                    More functionalities to be added to the app in the future such as advanced bill split (dish by dish), bill sharing (receipt to all) and a UI revamp.
