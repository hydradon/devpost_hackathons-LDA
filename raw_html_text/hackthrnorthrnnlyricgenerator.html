                    Idea
                </h2>

                    The idea came from an article I
                    <a href="https://medium.com/towards-data-science/https-medium-com-sh-reya-taylor-swift-or-artificial-intelligence-19f2989ab7a4" rel="nofollow">
                        read
                    </a>
                    on Hackathon Hackers generating lyrics based on Taylor Swift's own lyrics using neural networks. I was fascinated by it and the potential of neural network in song generation.

                    What I did
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What I did was try to replicate what I saw from that article and expand it to more artists. I built a web scraper that can either export its data to a .txt file or to CockroachDB database containing the lyrics. After I used Tensorflow to run a recurrent neural network modified a bit to suit my needs. The neural network learn from the lyric and generate a new lyric based on what it learned.
