                    Hapi - Twitter Sentiment Analysis
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We arrived at Brickhack with a completely different idea in mind. However, Tad Hunt's Google Cloud Platform tech talk inspired us to do something new. With all the negativity across social media, we wanted to see which users and hashtags have the most positive and negative tweets on average.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Based on the information collected by Hapi, Twitter users can decide whether or not to follow specific hashtags or users.  Also, by running your own personal twitter through Hapi, one is able to see whether or not they are making a positive influence on social media and hopefully correct their behavior accordingly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this project, we hope to create a more positive and supportive social media environment!
