                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As musicians, we felt that often when performing alone, we were limited by the expressiveness and desired being able to play over loops. However, loop pedals cost above of $80, so we wanted to make something accessible, with technology everyone had. By building an iPhone app and connecting it to an Arduino pedal, we could greatly reduce the cost, and still make a great performing experience for artist and audience alike.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Players can set up a metronome naturally by tapping 4 beats at once. The iPhone calculates the metronome beat for you.
Next, the looper can record your tracks and then play them out when you want to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used iOS Swift and AVFoundation for the iOS app. We used Arduino for the hardware pedal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were new to Swift so getting the app developed was challenging. We also struggled with Bluetooth connection.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app front-end, and just making our first app (in this time-frame). It was a great encouragement to our team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    iOS development, Swift, learning how to incorporate everyone's contributions together in a complex project.

                    What's next for Loop Pedal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Multitrack looping, successful bluetooth connection, metronome that beats for you.
