                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on 2018 Minnesota Statuses 18B.37 Records; Plans; Inspections, a commercial or noncommercial applicator, or the applicator's authorized agent, must maintain a record of pesticides used on each site. Noncommercial applicators must keep records of restricted use pesticides. The record must include the:
(1) date of the pesticide use;
(2) time the pesticide application was completed;
(3) brand name of the pesticide, the United States Environmental Protection Agency registration number, and rate used;
(4) number of units treated;
(5) temperature, wind speed, and wind direction;
(6) location of the site where the pesticide was applied;
(7) name and address of the customer;
(8) name of applicator, name of company, license number of applicator, and address of applicator company; and
(9) any other information required by the commissioner.
(b) Portions of records not relevant to a specific type of application may be omitted upon approval from the commissioner.
(c) All information for this record requirement must be contained in a document for each pesticide application, except a map may be attached to identify treated areas. An invoice containing the required information may constitute the required record. The commissioner shall make sample forms available to meet the requirements of this paragraph.
(d) The record must be completed no later than five days after the application of the pesticide.
(e) A commercial applicator must give a copy of the record to the customer.
(f) Records must be retained by the applicator, company, or authorized agent for five years after the date of treatment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We see that filing this record and keeping a collection of records for five years are troublesome for farmers. Thus, we create pesticide-tracker app to allow farmers to easily fill these records online and keep them neatly.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This button takes you to a multi-step form that walks you through all the information required by government regulators to record and keep track of when applying pesticides to a site. For more information on all the information that is required, see here. To help those who need to manage these records, the Minnesota Department of Agriculture provides a template form. But, the problem is that there is no effective way to keep track of and manage that information, especially since the government requires people to retain these records for 5 years. So, to streamline this process, we added a simple form to the app that you can fill out and save within the web app.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project is built using React, which is an open source JavaScript library developed at Facebook specifically for the task of developing user interfaces. React relies on a component-based architecture where elements of the user interface are broken into small chunks of code called components. To design and build the user interface, we used the Material UI library, which is a 3rd party UI library of React components that mimic Google's Material Design specification. We used Material UI for styling, theming, and incorporating cool components. As to the grid/layout system we used, we went with Flexbox, making it easy to design for smaller screens.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project also uses Google's Firebase Real Time Database to store data from a pestacide dataset from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The dataset includes information about different chemical products used to treat fields across the U.S and outside the U.S. However, for this project, we limited the scope to only Minnesota. For more information on the dataset we used for this project, go here.
