                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of our friends have gardens that they have to keep track of in their head. This can be very annoying to keep track off and is prone for forgetfullness and clumsiness. We want to make this task easier!

                    Welcome to GrOwFlO! This app will ensure that flower lovers are able to take care of their plants while doing something they always do: check the weather. Users are able to type in almost every city in the world and are able to get the temperature reading and a message explaining how to take care of their plant in that type of environment.

                    We built the project using Android Studio and the Yahoo-Weather API.

                    This was our first Android Project, so we needed to learn a lot about Android Development in general.
