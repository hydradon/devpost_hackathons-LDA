                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the horror stories that we read about the tube and the long and sometimes spooky history of London.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Brings you on an unforgettable adventure, searching for clues of the notorious Jack the Ripper who has been transported to present-day London, freely roaming along the night tube. You have to find clues, solve puzzles and navigate the tube to track down this elusive killer.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Anvil platform for the web app, css for the front-end and python for the backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was a period of time when the navigation buttons were not working, and after a period of troubleshooting, we found out that it was because the buttons were not linked to the code.
