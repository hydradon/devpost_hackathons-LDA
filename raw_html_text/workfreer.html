                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the difficult process of finding and applying to jobs that suit your interests and skills. We wanted something that could help us match our resume with an employer and automatically apply for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users will begin by putting job filters and personal information into our app. The app will parse through this information and find jobs that best match the user. Following this, the app will assist in applying to the suited jobs and notify the user of their application status through a mail server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Selenium, Google Firebase, React.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenges we ran into were getting the Firebase Listener to work from Python, Firebase updating, and multiple clients using the same database.
