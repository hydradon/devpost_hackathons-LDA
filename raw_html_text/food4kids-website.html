                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The aim of the hack was to be able to offer donors the ability to purchase specific items that will go into the bags the children receive.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was specified that the website would ideally be one page that acts as a virtual grocery store for the kids with the specific items that Food4Kids outlined as most needed. We created a user-friendly website that easily lets donors select the type of food and the quantity of food that they wish to donate. After speaking to Tom Flood, the go-to guy for the organization, we discovered that the age demographic for visitors of the website comprised mostly of adults, rather than the younger population. Naturally, we had to optimize the intuitiveness and the user-friendliness of the website so as to encourage the original population to adopt this new page to the already-existing website.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using HTML, CSS, and Javascript
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to self-teach ourselves a lot of Web Development syntax and coding principles in general.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to walk into a 24 hour hackathon, and actually feel the satisfaction of something coming together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We became aware of the existence of a service such as Food4Kids, and we became exposed to the world of Website Development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Food4Kids Website
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As disclosed as part of the hackathon challenge, hopefully, Food4Kids will take our code and directly implement it into their actual website so that they can seamlessly add in another feature to their website with no issues.
