                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    IIT Students are robbed around Chicago far too frequently. This app will hopefully help all residents of Chicago avoid areas where strings of crimes have been occuring.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Precrime extracts data about certain crimes such as robbery and assault, and maps them onto a Google Map. Then, using geolocation, Precrime can determine if you are approaching areas that are considered "dangerous".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team separated work into different phases, collecting data, displaying data on the map, and calculating if a user's location is in a range of danger. We also provided a night mode for potential users who may be walking around in the dark.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google Map API was difficult to transfer Chicago Police data too because it had a specific format of acceptable data. Also, it was a struggle to make the map continually follow the user's location.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learn how to fetch data from database by API. How to invoke Google map on our own website.
We improved our skills of using JavaScript, CSS and Html. We improved teamwork ability.
