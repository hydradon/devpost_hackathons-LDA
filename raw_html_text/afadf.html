                    Blav
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Blav is a tool for the blind to navigate around. It uses a Qualcomm Dragonboard 410c for sensors and other data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it was made
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The dragonboard collects data like webcam, distance, etc. and determines which direction to walk in using Machine Learning and Image Processing.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The hasura backend is used to communicate between the dragonboard and the computer. It has a flask-restful api deployed.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How does it detect
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Using image processing, we detect certain points on the 'sidewalks'.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Then, we run regression over it to get a polynomial.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The angle of intersection between these two polynomials determines which direction to turn in.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Difficulties we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The dragonboard was a huge pain to get working as there isn't much documentation on it. The Hasura APIs had little to none documentation, which made it very hard to set up.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The biggest challenge we ran into was getting the dragonboard to output current through its GPIO pins. It sounds easy, but with almost no documentation about a certain include error, we took hours to resolve that.
## What's next
We would love to get this out in the real world and make our algorithm much more reliable.
