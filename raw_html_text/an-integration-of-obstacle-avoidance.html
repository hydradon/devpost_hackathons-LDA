                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It all started with a simple idea: a robot that moves chairs. From there, we brainstormed and extended the original idea to not only that, but includes other functions like avoid obstacles .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    basically, our vision for this project is an integration of obstacle avoidance and object tracking system. The functionality of the project is twofold. First, it is capable of forward-moving. we want the design to be able to fulfill out most original idea, which is to move around household objects like chairs. Second, we kind of deviated dramatically from the original thing and it should be able avoid objects and obstacles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into quite a few difficulties while working on the project. Partly due to all of us are first year students and none of us has much experience both in hardware or in hackathon. We were super confused and lost during the first few hours of the hackathon, and we didn't really know how to approach and solve those problems. Also there were two sensors we couldn't get them working, but we still decided to put the on.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We finally put things that we are not even sure about the names and finished a robot that mostly functions. We did very intense research and asked  many people and were able to solve significant issues. We are extremely proud for our accomplishments

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is nothing that we cannot tackle if we have our mind set on this. We were working on things that we are completely not familiar with for nearly a whole day in straight and that is straight up amazing. Also, we walk in the event nothing nothing, not even what is Arduino, but right now while I'm typing all of these, two of my teammates were discussing all about capacitors, resistors and all kinds of sensors.

                <h2>
                    What's next for an integration of obstacle avoidance
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We haven't really considered that yet, but one thing we can say for sure right now is that we are positively sure that this design is going to be one of those that can change the world.
