                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Authentication is a very big concern among people and companies. Identity theft is becoming more popular and alongside paving the way to hacking and loss of important data. Popular authentications are biometrics, face recognition, voice recognition, and similar ones.  EMG signals are electric potentials generated by muscle cells when these cells are electrically or neurologically activated. According to Belgacem, Noureddine, EMG signal offers a relatively high security than a fingerprint, face, and iris recognition because it is difficult to forge and modulate. With this, as one of our inspiration, we decided to develop a personal website which contains details about your flight and gives you details about your respective bank.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Collects signals in the form of hand gestures and log's into their website when the gesture is performed by the right person.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We interface the MYO armband with the website through with the help of python and javascript.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MYO armband has its own SDK software which uses visual basics and also causes problems when trying to interface with websites. Alongside, we used machine learning to train the website to recognize the gesture and the people who will be using it. Thereby, there were few difficulties I the formatting and structuring of the data.
