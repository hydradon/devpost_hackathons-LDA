                    The front page of the website welcomes the user with critical information and statistics about sexual assault and outlines the vision behind the dashboard.

                    There are three primary data sources integrated into

                    </em>
                    . The first is an open source database about sexual assault in academia called

                        Sexual Harassment In the Academy: A Crowdsource Survey

                    </a>
                    . We visualize the gender breakdown of the survivors in the database as well as their academic backgrounds with interactive bar graphs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second data source is Twitter, where #MeToo hashtags run rampant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The third data source is our live-update survey database from our custom design survey.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The entire online data dashboard is built using R Shiny.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Twitter data is ingested from Twitter using an API wrapper called
                    <a href="http://tweepy.readthedocs.io/en/v3.5.0/" rel="nofollow">
                        Tweepy
                    </a>
                    , which has built-in functionality for querying the API for keywords.  In this case, we queried tweets with #MeToo in the text body.  Additional variables were inferred from the raw data including retweets, gender, and ethnicity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To infer the user's gender, we used a Python package called
                    <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SexMachine" rel="nofollow">
                        SexMachine
                    </a>
                    that employs a gender classification model trained on over 40,000 first names. The model classifies first names as either unknown, male, female, mostly male, and mostly female.  The ethnicity inference was computed using the
                    <a href="https://github.com/appeler/ethnicolr" rel="nofollow">
                        ethnicolr
                    </a>
                    package, which draws its predictions from a combination of the US Census database, Florida Voter Registration data, and Wikipedia data. The model classifiers and diagnostics for these packages were unfortunately not listed on the package's websites.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used Google Sheets as the backend database for our survey data collected via Google Forms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used dialog and pre-trained model to build our chatbot.

                    <li>
                        Reactive programming with a huge datase: I needed to program an action button to delay the analysis of text input until the text input is complete, in other words, only do one analysis of "metoo" instead of running analysises of "m", "me", "met", "meto" and "metoo" when the user input the text string
