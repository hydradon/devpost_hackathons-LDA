                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The bubble tea food event in the 2017 HTN Schedule.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a simulation of a Bubble Tea Shop, where you create bubble tea to satisfy your customers before time runs out!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We split up the work into different classes, and researched and collaborated to code it through android studios.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were lots of walls and learning to do as none of us were very familiar with coding with android as well as working with git.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We actually created a working app within the span of 36 hours!!! It has cool animations and we got a progress bar to work!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned many things about android and java programming, and personally, I learned a lot about git.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bubble Tea
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will probably add more add-ons such as perhaps sound and more food options.
