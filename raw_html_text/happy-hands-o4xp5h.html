                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As technological students and workers, we know how tired the hands and wrists can get by day's end, if not by midday. Along with programmers, there are also gamers who spend many consecutive hours with their hands in the same position on the keyboard, and people with wrist/hand injuries, disorders or syndromes. As such we decided to create a game using LeapMotion and Unity to do wrist exercises at the correct pace, while striving for a high score. This way relaxing the hands, and taking the mind off of the task can be fun as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The player must align their hand along with a pre-cut design in a moving wall and hold it there to ensure that they get points. If they touch the wall as it passes, points are subtracted. In order to fit most of the design the player must maintain the proper form and be able to hold it for a few seconds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity to create a base game, and then added leap motion hand tracking with colliders in order to facilitate the game mechanics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have never done Leap Motion in the past, and it appears the Leap Motion is strongly suggested to be used along with Virtual Reality (which we decided not to do). This means we had to go outside of the given SDK to find ways to get interact-ability with the game scene. Tracking on the Leap Motion isn't the best, so sometimes the animated hand would do unexpected motions. Unity with Leap Motion would sometimes create a collision despite not actually making contact. Finally, Desiree had never used Unity before so it was a learning curve for the both of us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we created a way for every day working people to relieve their pain and stiffness. We're also quite proud that we managed to get it to work even at this level.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Leap Motion for the first time and learned how to get the hands to interact with other objects in Unity, we also improved our understanding of how to perform tasks such as movements and collisions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Happy Hands
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully, we can could update our models, make our collisions more seamless, and once fully polished deploy to an open source distributor so that our target audience would actually be able to play.
