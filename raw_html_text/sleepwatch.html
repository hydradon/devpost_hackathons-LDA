                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students, we often experience a lack of sleep due to excessive amounts of schoolwork and unlimited freedom to use technology. Especially at night, it is easy to waste several hours on our computers or phones instead of catching up on desperately needed sleep. Another inspiration for our application was Forest, an app that prevents you from looking at your phone for a set amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SleepWatch tracks the monitor usage of the computer. When creating an account, the user sets a start and end time in the night when they are not allowed to use their computer. If activity is detected during those times, the tree they are growing will die. However, if they follow through, they can earn a streak, similar to snapchat, motivating them to continue their new good habits.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The portion on the computer detects the status of the monitor and updates the database with information regarding the time remaining. A separate website is used to configure start and end times for users and view their tree.
                </p>
