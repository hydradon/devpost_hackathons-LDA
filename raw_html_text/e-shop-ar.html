                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest inspiration is Amazon. Starting from an online book store to a company which generates $ 61 Billion in revenue. We wanted to do something related to books since amazon started its business from it and we love reading books a lot
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you heard of the proverb "Do not judge a book by ts cover"? Our app has come to put an end to it. Whenever you are stuck with a decision whether to buy a book or not in a book store. Just open this app and show the book's cover, you will be able to see the Average customer review, detailed description and links to the book on the amazon store.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application runs on ARCore. So with the power of Amazon Sumerian and ARCore we have built this application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really faced a hard time to control the entities via script and sometimes the same code dint work and worked after a couple of minutes. Some minor challenges with the time line and state machines.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are so proud that we could build this Proof Of Concept in a short span of time since we came to know about this challenge only during mid-december.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt Amazon sumerian to an intermediate level
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for E-Shop AR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are planning to take the next step and fetch data from APIs to display on the books and to set image targets dynamically whenever a new book has been added to the database since image target plays a key role in our app. It'd be really great if Amazon could provide us with some sample APIs for some of their books available on amazon store.
