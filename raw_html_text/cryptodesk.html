                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we arrive to Bloomberg headquarters we fall in love with the Bloomberg Terminal but we have seen that was so advanced for almost all the humans. On the other hand with Bloomberg Terminal you can't trade with cryptocurrencies yet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this reason and because of the love that we have with the cryptocurrencies we have decided to develop this amusing project! We hope that the specialist from J.P Morgan and Bloomberg will give us feedback then:)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a user friendly trading platform in order that anybody can loss the fear for the cryptocurrencies. It works with Poloniex and Gdax Apis and we have also developed a CycleTrading algorithm in order to ease the work of the traders and a Bot for facebook because everybody wants to trade in a easy way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have build it from cero with Node, Angular and Mongo. Each member of the team is specialized in a topic, one have done all the things related with bots, the other all the backend and api and the last one all the frontend.
                </p>
