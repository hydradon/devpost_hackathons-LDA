                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all have grandmas, grandpas, uncles and aunties that we regularly help with digital technology. It's part of being a family, it's part of being Singaporean. Inspiration struck when we asked ourselves, rather than levelling them up to use technology, why not repurpose technology that was familiar to them? Dudu, the recognisable sound that we all make when we call our uncles and aunties regardless of which language we speak, became the name of our latest product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dudu is a services integrator that turns a traditional phone call into your modern day convenience.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Sketch to prototype.
