                    People are usually indecisive about what to get for lunch or dinner. We propose a solution for this. Our project is using machine adaptive software to recognize your eating patterns and recommend choices. This software will be able to filter the results based on many categories, such as food type, texture, origin, ingredients, or availability for disabled people. The user will be able to "upvote" or "downvote" the foods ordered, and based on this the software will recommend future choices. We will also implement a social media aspect that will allow you to share your meal and comments with your friends.
