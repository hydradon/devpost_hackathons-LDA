                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Artificial intelligence is a topic that interested our whole group. Even though implementing an intelligent system into a game is a challenging task for a single weekend, we wanted to explore how far we could get.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tactical Traps is essentially a puzzle/strategy game in which the player attempts to place obstacles throughout floors of a building to impede the progress of thieves attempting to steal a valuable artifact from the top floor. We intended to design the enemy AI such that it would learn from past failures due to being caught in one of the player's traps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed the game from scratch using the Unity game engine. We used C# scripting to implement various behaviors on objects within the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AI is a complicated topic with which our group was inexperienced. We also realized how time consuming and detail-intensive game development can be, even with the aid of a game engine like Unity. These issues were compounded with the fact that we had only a couple of days to fully implement a complicated system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to implement a lot of the base systems and components of the user interface for our game. We learned quite a bit more about Unity functions and features as well, which could help with future projects. Our C# knowledge has also grown quite a bit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tackle Traps
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many core components to our game are still incomplete. Hopefully, we can find time to continue developing our project into a more complete game.
