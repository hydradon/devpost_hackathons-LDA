                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Besides computer science, I have an interest in earthquakes and the frequency of certain locations being more seismically active than others. With this new skill, I can be told the most up-to-date information from the United States Geological Survey about recent earthquakes around the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program will read out the all earthquakes that have hit anywhere in the world in the last hour, including their location and magnitude.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the USGS GEOJSON API, I was able to build a Node.js application that parses the data and turns it into a format that the Echo can understand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to separate the earthquakes out from one another proved to be a challenge. By using string parsing I was able to splice the earthquakes by a common string structure found in each earthquake's location field.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to connect the Amazon Echo service with an API opens many doors for future application, something I will be looking forward to very soon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since the JSON can take time to retrieve from the USGS, I implemented the GET request as a function callback to ensure that the control flow halts until the entire data is available.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Earth Shaker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding new features, such as earthquakes that have happen in the past week, month, or year would be a great addition. Also, being able to sort those larger connection by the highest magnitude would also be a great addition to this skill.
