                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dartmouth has a problem - a huge one actually. Since we first ran around the bonfire during Homecoming, Dartmouth students have faced obstacles in maintaining friendships, from a busy academic schedule to the unpredictable D-Plan. Too often, students promise and say: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Get a Meal!&rdquo; but never are able to schedule it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed an app that takes the hassle out of scheduling. With a quick shake, the 2 students are able to immediately schedule a meal together to catch up. Let&rsquo;s GAM makes that meal a reality. Users are able to register and login with Facebook. When users encounter each other and want to schedule a meal while meeting on the go, they simply just shake their phones at the same time and Let&rsquo;s GAM will automatically look at the two parties&rsquo; calendars to schedule a meal during their next common availability. No need to pull out their calendars and guess and check availabilities. Let&rsquo;s GAM does it instantaneously. Meals are organized chronologically and are automatically scheduled into both users&rsquo; calendars. By setting a date and time on their smartphones , students will be more likely to meet. There&rsquo;s also the function that allows users to click on scheduled meals on the app to start chatting via Facebook Messenger to talk logistics before the meal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app with android. The backend was built with Parse
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were 2 major challenges: detecting when 2 people shake their phones, and then going through their calendars to to figure out intersecting available hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GAM
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to implement it on campus to help create a tighter community at Dartmouth. Those red cups during 2012-13 didn&rsquo;t quite work in helping people eat together at FoCo but we hope Let&rsquo;s GAM will bridge the gap.
