                    PROBLEM
    Climate change is a leading cause for concern in todays society. Many people want to reduce their impact, but simply don&rsquo;t know how. With Terra Bit, consumers can track the carbon consequences of every aspect of their lives. By being aware of our carbon footprint, we can all make changes that will help combat the negative effects of carbon emissions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    TERRA BIT APP
    In the Terra Bit app, users can input information about their daily lives including their eating habits, transportation methods, and even link smart home devices to track the carbon emissions associated with their lifestyles. Terra Bit will output a score which allows consumers to see their carbon output based on the average emissions of people living in their country. This score can be changed by reducing their daily habits, or by donating to carbon offset charities right in our app. Terra Bit also informs consumers about which brands are interested in protecting the environment. Businesses with a good rating from Terra Bit can offer discounts to app users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    SMART HOME COMPATIBILITY
    Consumers can link any smart home devices they own right to the app to track their thermostat, energy, and hydro emissions in real time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    FINTECH
    Consumers with a good score can receive special insurance premiums from banks and insurance providers. By bringing consumers together with insurance providers, individuals who actively try to reduce their impact can be rewarded an opportunity to save on insurance, while banks can receive new customers for their offered services.
DATA COLLECTION 
The data collected from consumers is valuable in a world that is changing rapidly due to carbon emissions. Due to the value of consumer information regarding lifestyle habits, this information could be shared with insurance providers, businesses, or for research purposes.
