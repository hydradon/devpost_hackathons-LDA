                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Migraines are common ailments across the nation. Knowing the difference between a headache and a migraine can help to determine medical health.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Asks the user a series of questions to determine whether the user has a migraine, a headache, or something else.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used Android Studio, and a little bit of pain and suffering (jk)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Absolutely no experience with Android Studio before beginning the project. Could not develop the app to match the idea considered before the hackathon started.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developing an Android app with some functionality within 36 hours with no prior experience in Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Much more difficult than expected. The amount of resources available on Android Studio makes it a little overwhelming.
                </p>
