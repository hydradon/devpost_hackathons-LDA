                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were walking through the city while coming to Dragon Hacks and found it really inefficient to see parking meters and parking kiosks all over the city.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a RESTful API which the city officials can push all of the city's parking spots to. We also built an iOS app which people can use when traveling to cities to find open parking spots closest to them. They can then claim a spot they park in and also pay for it after they leave the spot, all from their phone.
Police officers can also built their own client app which links to our API to track parking violations.
We also have API endpoints set to fetch analytics data such as the most busy/open streets and times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The RESTful API was built in python-flask with a my-sql backend.
The iOS app was built in Swift.
                </p>
