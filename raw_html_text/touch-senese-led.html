                <h2>
                    What if I made LED's controllable by touch?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Touch sensors are in our everyday life, but with a little work, and a couple of micro controllers, I figured I could add some flare to the ordinary touch sensor. There are only three components: A low power consumption board called the Pearl Gecko, an Arduino Uno, and a strip of LEDs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The capacitive touch sensor is housed on the Pearl Gecko. Once it senses a touch, it sends this information via GPIO to the Arduino (Either 0 for no touch, or 1 for touch). The Arduino then takes this information, and drives the LED's accordingly. The buttons on the Pearl Gecko give different types of lights to display!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Pearl Gecko is a low power consumption board, so by default most devices on the board are powered off. In order to turn a peripheral on (like the touch sensor), I had to: enable the peripheral's clocks (in many cases, one peripheral runs off of many different clocks), route the connection, and finally initialize the peripheral.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now that the sensor is enabled, I need to establish that a touch has occurred. The sensor has a register that stores its data at all times(0x0 for no touch, and around 0x4050 for a touch). If a touch occurred then the GPIO pin would be set to high.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to have more fun I decided to add push button functionality as well that changed what color and style of LEDs would be displayed.

                        Moving to the Arduino
                    </strong>
                    , the LEDs are driving using the famous FastLED library. This gave me a skeleton structure to code the LEDS off of, as well as well defined values for colors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There was one output pin for the LED data, and 3 input pins to read in the Pearl Gecko Data.
There is an interrupt on one of the pins, in order to have stacked LED display.

                <p>
                    The Pearl Gecko uses code that embedded software to satisfy its low power consumption. The Arduino Uno is a board that is higher level. Making these two talk to each other was very difficult at times. I originally wanted to use SPI, UART, or I2C, but I figured that a simple

                <p>
                    I want to piggy back off of my 5mA comment before, if this system only draws that much current here is what is in store with this idea:

                        Specific board design for this idea
                    </strong>
                    If I could isolate all of the logic onto one board, the power draw would be even less, through some math about ~3mA average. This would allow the addition of flare to any touch sensor system on the market, without impeding the circuitry at all. Why?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        3mA is very negligible.
                    </strong>
                    How negligible?
                </p>
                <p>
                    An iPhone 7 battery has a 1960mAh battery. Meaning you could run this circuitry for 653 hours drawing 3 mA.
