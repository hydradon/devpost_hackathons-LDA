                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever found yourself searching around a store trying to find a certain product? Trying to hail down a store associate to help you find that last item on your list? That's what inspired us to create an application to improve the experience of shopping in a physical store.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    NinjaShop allows users to manage their shopping list through our app. When you're ready to shop, we'll analyze your list and organize it. NinjaShop will present you with a map that shows the most optimal store route. You can then go through the list and route as you check things off.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backend uses python and we integrated that with flask in order to communicate with the HTML front end which was linked with MongoDB.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were a lot of unexpected technical details that we didn't foresee such as the integration between the python program and the web app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Delivering a working project in such tight time frame. Everyone can relate and make use of our product
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how users approach shopping and the science that goes behind shopping expierence. We excelled our python skills and branched into python web frameworks integeration such as Flask, using Jinja Templates. We also, learned how to deal with NoSQL databases using MongoDB.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ninja Shop
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe their is a large future potential for NinjaShop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We've all been faced with frustrations at physical stores, and we've all been faced with the decision of whether to buy an item online or go to a physical store. Improving the shopping experience in physical stores will enable them to compete with eCommerce stores. This has vast implications, from supporting local communities to reducing shipping waste.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many features can add to the value of NinjaShop, including collaboration, inventory checks, reports on how crowded the store is, and coupon integration.
