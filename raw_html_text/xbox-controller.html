                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Waterfront workers struggle with using tablets and other informative devices in the field while wearing protective gear. You want a physical solution to easily manipulate and navigate information without removing gear. So use a controller: an already existing, cheap solution that has been designed and perfected to be usable for general purposes.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hook up a game controller for iPad/Android devices and map the buttons to functions you want. Use the analog stick for rotation (one stick for rotating the object, one for camera like a game).
                </p>

                    How I built it

                    I didn't, but I'm submitting the idea in case you find it useful.
