                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "Kidz Quiz Bee" has questions from three categories Animals, Places and Capitals. The data needs to be stored in the database. A table "QuizTable" is created containing data, questions and other content for 3 categories. A Lambda function is invoked with the required "Alexa Skillskit" and DynamoDb trigger to call the skill.
Since the content for this skill comes from a table, new questions and content can be added on a scheduled time to keep the young audience engaged and for them to learn more about animals, places and capitals.
The required sample utterances and intents were created to make sure all the important scenarios are taken care.
Finally, the skill is published and is now live for all. Though this skill is primarily created for kids, it can be invoked and used by anyone with a curious mind and a thirst for knowledge.

                <p>
                    The challenges in creating the "Kidz Quiz Bee" skill range from technical, design and testing.
The technical challenges include creating, mapping and designing the required intents and speech utterances in the skill. The primary audience being kids, proper care needs to be taken on designing the skill so that every possible error is taken care through appropriate intents and mapping all possible answers that can be expected from a kid.
The tables and the required data were initially created in DynamoDb which did not trigger, to be later included within the function for appropriate results. 
Design challenges involve creating speech utterances and mapping answers wherein Alexa provides appropriate answers to the response. The skill is designed to accept every possible correct answer. The skill is designed so as to provide hints and help feature at every stage.
Testing challenges include testing the skill for every possible wrong scenario and if missed mapping it with the correct intent and responses from Alexa. As this skill primarily targets kids, all the possible answers from weird, wrong and answers other than the given choices are mapped with an appropriate response from Alexa.
