                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am a fencer and while refereeing, I often have a hard time remembering scores and keeping track of the cards people have received.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows fencers to keep score during their bouts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used swift
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Autolayout was a big issue, I'm still working on it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding the card functionality, other fencing scoring apps I've seen neglect this, and it's pretty frustrating.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that if I have a need for something I can make it myself rather than just wishing for it to appear.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bout Time
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding the ability for the user to change the default time. I'd also like to add a piece where the user could input their weapon and the amount of points they're fencing to and my app would set the timer for them.
                </p>
