                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project allows you to view the globe of Earth in space inside virtual reality, with interesting locations marked on the surface, with names and miniature photos. The globe can be rotated by hand gestures and locations can be selected by looking at them. Another gesture allows entering a selected location to see the inside of a photo sphere.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity as the engine, Oculus Rift for the virtual reality and the Myo wristband for gestures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were certain technological issues with the Rift and Myo working together on an old Windows laptop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It kinda works, who would have thought.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You need a better computer for virtual reality and prepare earlier.
