                    We were inspired to build R U There after experiencing enormous class sizes for the first time at college. As undergraduates at UC Berkeley, we were overwhelmed by the sheer number of students in each class; needless to say, normally mundane class activities such as attendance became time-inefficient and unnecessarily complex. More gratifying than our completion of this project, however, is the new technologies we learned along the way. Both of us were completely unfamiliar with Firebase and the integration of Geolocation. Moreover, we did not have much frontend development experience, which allowed us to learn as we hacked. However, this was not without its challenges; we spent much of our time reading through documentation, discussing with mentors, and whiteboarding to tackle engineering challenges in an unfamiliar problem space. In the future, we hope to expand upon our initial product to make the interface more accessible to students and teachers alike, while expanding our user group to student clubs, fraternities/sororities, and maybe even hackathons!
