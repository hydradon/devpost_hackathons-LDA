                    I was born in a country called Jordan, where it had an extreme amount of poor/homeless people, my family being one of the luckier ones to be poor instead of on the street, homeless. Although I wasn't homeless, I still felt the pain of hunger, not able to always have a meal. After twelve years of living there, we decided to move the the U.S.A. In hopes for a better future, and there, my life got better. I was able to eat normally, choosing what I want to eat. I was able to sleep in a warm, safe home, knowing I'll find a meal on my plate tomorrow. Now, one day while I was walking home, I had a sandwich in my hand, a homeless man approached me, and asked me for the sandwich. He looked like he hadn't eaten any decent meal in at least a few days. I offered him the sandwich, which he gratefully took, thanking me for my kindness. Seeing him reminded me of myself and all the kids families living on the streets in Jordan, struggling to get day to day. Fast forward to now, when my teacher mentioned the Hackathon for the homeless, I wanted to stop homelessness from happening, to stop homelessness in its tracks and to improve everyone's quality of life.
                </p>

                    Our Hackathon idea is called

                    , and it's a Kiosk that is able to help people find solutions to their problems before it is too late. Our kiosks are able to help with: Veteran's services, Addictions, Mental Health, Housing Fees, Utility Bills, Legal Services, Medical Bills, Student Loans, Finding Jobs, Interview Wardrobe help, and Physical, Mental, Emotional, and/or Sexual Abuse Support. The way we built is by: CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and PHP.

                    Some of the challenges we ran into along the way had mainly to do with time constraints. We've only had around 16 hours collectively to create a website and have ideas to prevent homelessness. We also had problems with the internet because it for some reason would not send out to our general area due to the computers and the grade of WiFi.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to built a functioning website able to help the people in jeopardy of becoming homeless, and that we gave ideas to make people who have troubles with money, loans, bills, and many other things. Our biggest hope is that our website provides the best solutions to the people who desperately need it.

                    Some things we learned were how to code better than we were able to previously, we also learned how to work as a team with all the odds stacked against us, and we learned how to think of innovative and creative ideas to

                    </strong>
                    problems.  Finally, we learned how important people like us could be to those who can't help or defend themselves, knowing that one day we can thwart homelessness for good.  We have the power to make a positive change in many people's lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we advance, we will be using it to forward our project and make it into a reality, so that no one has to suffer. If we don't get any income, we will STILL try and move forward with this, as it is extremely important for our society of as a whole.
