                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As fans of role-playing games and lovers of imagination, we decided that we wanted to create something decently complex that we could all find ourselves sinking hours into.

                    allows you to pit two customizable armies with specific stats and gear per unit against each other and watch in real time as they duke it out to survive the battle. The simulation algorithm takes into account each team's weapons, armor, and stats and executes events based on this data and RNG.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We divided up the labor into two categories, UI and logic, and proceeded to work as two sub-teams conquering these tasks. We occasionally met up for bug-fixing and style decisions  and before long,

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The majority of the team had little knowledge of JavaScript and it's intricacies and because of that, we ran into a myriad of bugs in our simulation algorithm. In particular, we were not used to dynamic typing and the bugs it can introduce as we all came from Java/C backgrounds.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The simulation algorithm is decently modular, allowing us to add events and items freely as we choose to do so. The writing is pretty good on the event and item descriptions too!

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    Each member of the team learned a great deal about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as valuable collaboration techniques.
