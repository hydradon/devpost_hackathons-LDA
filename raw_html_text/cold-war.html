                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to create Cold War after seeing the hackathon submissions for best design/UI last year. We wanted to test ourselves and make a game that would not only play, but also be seen as visually appealing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In Cold War, you take the reins of one of six countries with nuclear capabilities in the world. Your objective is to balance offence and defense to eliminate other countries while keeping your relative damages down in singleplayer turn-based gameplay.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game is completely coded in Pygame.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a steep learning curve for Pygame, which only one of our members had previously used before. This became an additional challenge when trying to apply all the background functions of the game to a UI and HUD.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game started off very ambitious, with lots of elements that ended up being cut due to time constraints. We definitely overestimated how quickly a lot of the elements of the game would come together. Our group is simply proud of putting out a product that is functional and visually pleasing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned a great deal of Pygame.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cold War
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are planning on possibly adding more advanced features including more involving systems of interaction between countries as well as more advanced computer players.
