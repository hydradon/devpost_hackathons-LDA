                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This started out as a simple game of just guessing what the next card.  It has grown with different features as it has progressed.  It allowed me to learn more about what can be done with an Alexa skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is guessing game that utilizes playing cards.  The deck is shuffled and the first card is presented.  The player then guesses if the next card in the deck is higher or lower then the last card or if the card is red or black.  Score is kept and personal high score is recorded.  A point is awarded for each correct guess and extra points are awarded for completing each deck of cards.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created this as an Alexa hosted skill.  Images for the skill are hosted on Amazon S3 storage.  The back-end programming is done in javascript utilizing node.js and incorporating ASK-SDK.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project started as a simple voice only game that only went through one deck, did not keep score, and did not have extra life purchase available.  It has since grown to include APL for screen devices that also included touch capability.  Getting the touch screen devices to work correctly was a challenge.  The program was also modified to keep score and go through multiple decks.  This was a challenge because each modification had to be robust enough to handle all aspects of the skill.  The last change was to add ISP which presented a challenge to properly use persistence to pull and save information correctly.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of the skill overall.  It was a lot of work to get it to the point it is at.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about all the different modifications that were done to the program.  Each change had its own set of skill, syntax, and knowledge that will be beneficial in future programs.
                </p>

                    What's next for Bus Ride
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I think the next step is to create a leader board to track high score from all players that want to compare against others.  Also maybe a badge system to track achievements.
