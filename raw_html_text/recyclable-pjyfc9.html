                    An app that lets users know whether certain objects are recyclable or not.

                    Inspiration
                </h1>
                <p>
                    I've generally found myself in confusion sometimes debating over whether or not an object is recyclable, so I decided to make an app that tells you.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    What it Does
                </h1>
                <p>
                    This app asks the user to enter an object name into the text field. The app then determines whether or not the app is recyclable from a built in database. Lastly the app fetches a website and opens it, providing the user with the closest recycling facilities.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    How I built it
                </h1>
                <p>
                    I built this app using Java and XML through Android Studio. I also fetched and retrieved data from a website called Earth911.com.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am proud of being able to fetch and retrieve data from a website that details where the closest recycling facilities are.
