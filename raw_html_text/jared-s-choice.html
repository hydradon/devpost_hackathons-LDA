                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by websites that provide random places to eat based on your location. We wanted to improve upon that idea by giving the user a healthy choice in addition to a place to eat
.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We prompt the user for a location and will return fast food within walking distance nearby. The user can click on the difference places to find healthy, low calorie options from the different restaurants. Once the user selects a restaurants we provide walking directions through google maps to help further encourage healthy happens.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this application using a mixture of APIs, including the USDA food database and Google Maps API. These are integrated into a dynamic website using PHP, HTML5/CSS, and Javascript. We host use Heroku as an online hosting service for the application.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team was very inexperienced with web technologies, with almost zero API and web hosting experience prior to this weekend. Additionally two out of three members have never been to a hackathon before.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were proud that we created what we felt was a completed product and were able to implement many of our stretch goals that we set forth on the first.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about web technologies including Heroku, PHP and API usage.

                <p>
                    We plan to leave the application on Heroku and want to make the website mobile friendly.
