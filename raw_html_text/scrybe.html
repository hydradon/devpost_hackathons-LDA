                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Higher education at foreign universities gives students an opportunity to gain
exposure to different communities and access to global opportunities. But language barriers could seem to be a setback for many such students&nbsp;who aim to pursue their education abroad. Our team created Scrybe with a vision to improve the accessibility of such students by providing a translation interface that intends to assist the classroom environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website allows both students and teachers to log in. The teacher signs in by entering the session info, and is directed to the&nbsp;main translation page where the teacher can speak into the microphone and see a transcript of the speech alongside with a translated copy of the teacher&rsquo;s choice. When a student logs in he/she gets to choose the session they want to sign in, and by doing so gets access to the professor's transcript of the lecture in real-time and choose what language would they like to see the converted text in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the main translation, we use Google&rsquo;s Cloud Speech API to convert audio from microphone to text&nbsp;and translate this text using Google&rsquo;sTranslation API.
