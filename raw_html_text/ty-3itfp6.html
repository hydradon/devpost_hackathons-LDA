                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Anand, Srilekha,Mofe and Amit met through Devpost, and although they were across the world (U.S and India), they were able to find a common issue and collaborate with their different backgrounds to create an innovative product for this hackathon. Due to the influx of electric vehicles in the recent era, we were inspired to create an application that can easily track the users' electric vehicles and the status of their charging for effective management. We believed that this application is a positive step forward in helping the environment as well because many people hesitate to migrate to electric vehicle due to maintenance difficulties. However, we hope with this application and ease of use, people will be motivated to use electric vehicles as they no longer cause a pain to manage, helping the world through use of clean energy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application essentially allows users to input their electric vehicle information and then search for charging stations nearby in order to find nearby stations and navigate to them. After they have navigated to the station of preference, they are able to scan a code which connects them to their digital wallet which is built by the Lightning Network wallet framework and SDK. Then, they can track the progress of their charging as well as make transactions online securely, providing a more efficient and easy way for electric vehicle management.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backend was primarily built on the AWS platform to incorporate the Lightning Network API in order to make transactions digitally. Additionally, the java spring boot and restful web services to primarily construct the backend framework. In terms of the front end, the tool that was used was Android Studio to build the application along with Google Cloud Services for the maps portion. The REST API was used to perform requests to the backend server running on AWS to perform calls and actions.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was hard to do the user authentication because I didn't know how to store the JWT token and perform requests with it across classes. Additionally, it was my first time incorporating the Google Maps API so that took some time. In terms of the back end. Learning how to integrate the wallet was also new so it was a bit difficult to get used to initially.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use a digital wallet in an application and created a mobile application that solves a real world problem. New aspects in terms of the front end include using the Google Maps API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot through this project, in putting our knowledge and experience in backend and front end development to create something that is truly impactful in society. Using the Google Cloud platform was intriguing to me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Evliion
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, we want to expand Evliion to a wider range other than just the United States and allow them to made larger transactions and manage multiple vehicles at the same time.
