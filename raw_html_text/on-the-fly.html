                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Panasonic Avionics had awesome APIs that can be used to hack awesome apps for inflight entertainment, news, weather, and more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Helps you notify a party when and where your arrival time is, while still in flight. It also forecasts weather and news and allows the Airline's passengers to tweet anonymously about their in flight experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android Studio and Java, we used Panasonic's APIs
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Environment issues. We spent the first 15 hours trying to build a hello world app (Never bring a work laptop to a hackathon that has VPN and other work security stuff on it). We almost gave up. But we did not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We finished it within a few short hours. Our UI/UX took a hit given our challenge however we managed to create a great product with less than ideal conditions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Never bring a work laptop to a hackathon that has VPN and other security stuff on it.

                    Make the UI/UX much better.
