                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to put a fresh spin on the first prompt and synthesize the process of loans with the modern trend of peer-to-peer services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows users to create profiles through which they can post loan offers on a market place list or pick the loans which best fit their needs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Java Swing was used to program the GUI and Java was also used to program the objects used within the application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Large segments of code had to be rewritten due to miscommunication between the different objects and code chunks in our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Typing a combined 450 lines of code between only two people, persisting through multiple hard-to-decipher bugs, and completing a systematized app for a creatively productive idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Organization and clear structuring is very important to precisely executing code and develop the potential for future expansion of projects
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Loan Zone
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Expand the amount of detail in user profiles and loan listings, implement a filter function to sort the market by, and expand the application to iOS and Android with online network connection.
