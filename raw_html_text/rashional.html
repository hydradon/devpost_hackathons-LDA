                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A friend of mine went hiking and was bitten by an insect. He thought nothing of it, nor the rash that appeared in a completely different location on his body from where he was bitten.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Later that week, he started complaining about headaches and muscle aches. He assumed he was tired. He was not.
He had contracted Lyme disease.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The rash that appeared on his skin didn't have the characteristic bulls-eye shape that Lyme disease is known for. But what if we could identify different dangerous rashes, based of an image? Enter, machine learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ask a user to take a photo or select a photo from the gallery on their smartphone, or somewhere on their computer.
Rashional will then provide a confidence level for our four trained concepts. Regardless of outcome, we will strongly suggest that the user visit a real health practioner - and we provide the contact information and addresses of nearby free medical clinics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How does it solve Access to Care
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Access to Care is a challenge at this years Hackathon with an aim to nulify social and regional determinants from impacting ones health. Our mobile/desktop app, Rashional, tackles this problem by using a Machine Learning Algorithim to identify different skin rashes, the severity, and utilizes a Free Clinic API to provide the user with a list of the nearest free healthcare clinics available to them. The app helps to provide initial insight and direction to a medical problem, in a field in which there is not a readily available solution that is accessible through the internet and works via a single picture upload.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app is also available in both English and Spanish so it can be accommodate a larger user base and provide Access to Care to a larger growing population of native English and Spanish speakers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We scraped the internet for hundreds of photos of various skin conditions, and focused on training our model for several dangerous skin conditions that are easily overlooked: Lyme Disease, Ringworm, Shingles, and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used react.js  to create a smooth and dynamic front end application that interfaces with our backend MongoDB Database and Machine Learning Software to provide the user with a seamless easy-to-use application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        React has a steep learning curve.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Domain name service changes take more 24h to come into effect.
                    </li>

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are able to accurately identify over 90% of confirmed cases of the 4 concepts we have trained in.
We built our frontend with the React framework, despite nobody on our team having experience in the framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cheese pizza looks frighteningly similar to shingles and ringworm to our trained model.
Artificial Intelligence isn't as frightening to use as many would believe.
React.js has a very steep learning curve with poor documentation, however once installed and setup correctly React.js provides a very flexible framework in allowing you integrate numerous components of an application.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're hoping to implement a Spanish plugin, to eliminate the language barrier and provide easier Access to Care.
