                    A Raspberry Pi app; press a button, get a Richard Stallman quote read out to you.

                <h2>
                    Why?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make our flat next year a welcoming environment for visitors. What better way to welcome people than a Richard Stallman quote?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally we tried using a Microbit using the built-in text-to-speech function. In fact, we spent most of Saturday trying to get that to work and work well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, we encountered many problems with the Microbit:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Text-to-speech was limited to only a few words at a time
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Microbit is very limited in storage size, meaning that we could not store all the quotes in a file, and had to limit ourselves to only a few selecteed quotes
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sound output required wiring up headphones using crocodile clips
                        <br>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    So we switched to using a Raspberry Pi at the last minute: this meant that:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        We could scrape Wikiquote live, giving us the latest quotes
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We could use a more advanced TTS library
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We could develop faster, as we didn't need to flash the program
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    On the hardware side we use:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A Raspberry Pi 2 running Raspbian
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A button wired up with a breadboard to the Pi's GPIO pins
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    On the software side, it's a Python app using:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The Raspberry Pi GPIO library for the button
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Wikiquote to scrape Stallman quotes from the net (technically IoT)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Espeak (en-scottish) for text-to-speech
                    </li>
