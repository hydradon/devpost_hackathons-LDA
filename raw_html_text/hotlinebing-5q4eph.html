                    The Backstory
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Microsoft recently acquired LinkedIn for 26 billion. I thought I should make something that Microsoft would acquire after this hackathon.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every new tab a user opens goes to bing.com. Every search they make in the search bar goes through bing.com. Every time a user tires to access one of google's 186 domains they get redirected to bing.com.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had never made a chrome extension before so i started by reading all of the documentation. Everything revolves around a maifest.json file and a background.js file.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For a few hours I struggled with making every search go through bing.com. I was trying to store the queries and redirect to google.com. After several hours of total failure i wrote a script that went into chrome setting and changed the default search engine.
