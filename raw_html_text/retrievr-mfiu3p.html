                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Team 56
One of our suite mates was worried about losing his possessions and never being able to find them again.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Retrievr allows people who find lost objects to enter in where the item was found, a short description, and which of the many lost and founds on campus will now have it.  People who lose items can then search through the entries by location and various descriptions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created Retrievr during a marathon coding session at the 2015 Hack @ UMass
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before we started this project, only one person on our team had had any experience with web programming.  There was a steep learning curve, but in the end, we triumphed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we managed to create a relatively finished product during the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through creating Retrievr, I learned pretty much everything I know about web programming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Retrievr
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to integrate Angular, improve code organization and clarity, custom regions for UMass, helpful guidelines, and many other features.
