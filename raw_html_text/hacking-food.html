                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What started as a passion for food quickly turned into a solution. With the everlasting problem of not finding what you are in the mood for, our team aimed to fix it. We wanted to come up with a solution to find exactly what food dish we were looking for and the restaurants that offer it.

                <p>
                    Hacking Food brings you the food you are looking for and the restaurants that offer it based on proximity. Now, with the click of a button, you can find the exact meal you want in a place closest to you. For example, let&rsquo;s say you want tacos but don&rsquo;t know which restaurant. With the help of Hackingfood, you will be able to find tacos near you with prices

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using various tools such as Microsoft Azure, mongoDB, and more, we were able to code and develop the ideal app for you to enjoy.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During the hackathon, we ran into several obstacles such as not being able to access a public IP through a cloud infrastructure. Additionally, we ran into an issue of finding the best APIs to incorporate for data and location.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create an application using ionic and stitch to send and receive data query requests. Additionally, we were able to leverage the mongoDB platform, the ionic Angular hybrid framework, and the Microsoft Azure Cloud platform. Our team implemented a pathway for future implementation of rev.ai API and Amazon Web Services.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Over the weekend, our team was able to learn how to work collaboratively, use new and different languages (Javascript, Python, and more), work around obstacles, and implement interesting features. Additionally, we were able to gain experience in integrating various tools to create a new product, the future of product development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hacking Food
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we hope that Hacking Food can become something meaningful where consumers will be able to use the app and find exactly what they are looking for. Additionally, over the course of its lifetime, we aim to monetize it and turn it into a business (ad revenue, subscriptions, and a freemium model). In other future plans, we would like to set a standard for menus across the world to help computers easily extract data. Hacking Food looks forward to changing the food industry and how consumers are able to overcome problems.
