                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team members uses a thermal camera to find lost dogs. If it can find dogs - why can't it find a drone?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When a drone controller is powered on a wake up signal is sent to the thermal camera network to search for and track the drone visually.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a RPi zero, a thermal camera, lots of flying, and hard work.
