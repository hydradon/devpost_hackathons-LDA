                    Project Name: Things to go
Team member: Erin, Tom, Matt, Rain

                <p>
                    1.0 Introduction (Background)
    People use convenience stores almost everyday. For example, there are some in the engineering pit, located in the basement of SF Building. Large amount of students from engineering and computer science visit there for food and drinks especially during lunch time which cased long waiting lines and chaos. On the other hand, during the exam period, when students stay late in the night, there are not so much place to purchase foods. 
    As student, we spend most of our time in school. For us, school is like a community. We acquire foods, drinks, books, school supplies and even drugs in school, while at the same time, we want to get those things as soon as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2.0 Problem Statement
    Students visit stores in pit, spending 5 or more minutes lining up, and find that products that they want to purchase are sold out. It&rsquo;s wasting their time, especially during the exam week. Besides, if a student who studies at Kelly library and wants to get textbooks or school supplies, then he or she has to go to the book store near Bahen center. And this will take him or her about half an hour. In the seek of saving time,  a new system, connecting stores and vending machines, that can update the storage information and enables student to pre-order products online, is required. Meanwhile this system should also distribute products to different location based on students behavioral. For instance, engineering textbooks, papers should be allocated to SF or GB, because most engineering students gather here.
3.0 Detailed Requirement
3.1 Functions
Connect all the machine on the cloud, so that the cloud can 
Suggest the nearest machine where the item is available, notify anything is out of stock before someone try to purchase
Reserve the items for pre-ordering customers
Predict the goods distribution for future (e.x. Provide more coffee/energy bars to school during exam weeks)
User interface
                    <br>
                    Users make appointments online before users come to get commodities from the machines
Auto suggestion and schedule
Payment
Shopping cart
Quantity remaining and location
Demonstrate the page when user is in front of the machine
Sounds as feedback
For the machine
Choose items and pay offline with cards or cash
Pick up items with mobile phone (using NFC, bluetooth, network, etc) or other personal identities (such as student card, driving licence that have been verified before)
Prepare freshly made foods which takes longer time (such as coffee, teas, fresh juices etc)
3.2 Objectives
                    <br>
                    Save power by turning off the vending machine when not needed
Save time by make people don&rsquo;t have to wait in line for their coffee
Intelligent stock tracking?
Query sending , personal default choice 
Distribute products efficiently
3.3 Constraints
Minimize the use of power
Environmental hazards
3 seconds delay
                </p>
                <p>
                    4.0 Service Environment
    4.1 Physical Environment
Basement of SF
                    <br>
                    Outside
Train station
4.3 Virtual Environment
                </p>
                <p>
                    5.0 Proposed Conceptual Design
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users order item online ahead of time and pay online
Vending machine turn on
Vending machine make the item
User pick up item
Vending machine turn off or serve the nex order
5.1 Frontend
Enable users to select goods and store in the shopping cart
Count for the cost of products and provide the choices of payment methods
Demonstrate the remaining quantity for each product in each location
5.2 Backend
Keep track about the count of items in different machines
5.3 Vending Machine
Only start the lighting and ordering system on when someone is closing (the ordering and management is mostly stored on backend)
