                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A couple days ago our team developed a revolutionary bitcoin trading algorithm that significantly out-performed market returns - we were ecstatic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We soon learned, however, that the market is very unfriendly to innovators, lacking an accessible means to trade and backtest trading algorithms. This is where K2 steps in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    K2 is a comprehensive backtesting platform for currency data, specializing in cryptocurrency, offering users the opportunity to create trading algorithms and simulate them on real-time and historical market data. We seek to equalize the playing field by enabling the general public to develop and test trading strategies. We created our own simple, Python-based API for users to use to develop their algorithm. They can then specify a trading interval, time frame, and currency symbol, and our backend visualizes the cumulative returns and generates financial metrics, quantifying the algorithm's performance against the market.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    K2 was built in JavaScript, jQuery, HTML5, CSS3, Python, AJAX, Node.js, Pandas, Numpy, Empyrical.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating the frontend with the backend proved quite difficult for our team. Our backtesting API is Python-based, so we had to execute Python code from the client-side and seamlessly incorporate the response into our frontend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Successfully creating a financially sound backtesting platform complete with a slippage model and transaction fees that can simulate trading strategies on real-time market data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Methods to integrate client and server-side systems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for K2
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A great idea is just that- an idea. We hope to publish, grow, and promote K2 through b2b sales, proprietary use, and customer outreach to truly bring wall-street to main-street.
