                    What it does
                </h1>
                <p>
                    This Chrome Extension integrates Expedia's API with Facebook Events. We take data from Expedia's API and create a drop down menu that gives you prices for the best package deal.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    How we built it
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We injected html into the Facebook page using Javascript and a chrome extension.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We ran into problems when attempting to get the users location so that we could use the Expedia API.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We had no knowledge of Javascript and we were able to create a program in 36 hours.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    What we learned
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Lot's of Javasript and HTML
                </p>

                    What's next for Facebook Travel Extension
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We need to find a way to get user's location and communicate with the Expedia API better.
