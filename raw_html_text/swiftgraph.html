                    Swift is a safe and powerful programming language which gives us many powerful features, including enums, tuples, protocols, generics, functional programming and more!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Neo4j is a leading NoSQL graph database built in Java with a really interesting concept: Model data as graphs! When you sit down to model data, you probably start by making a graph. I have people, they ATTEND the try! Swift conference. The people KNOW other people. I&rsquo;ve just described some nodes and the relationships between them!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's create SwiftGraph! SwiftGraph will be a fast, in-memory graph, modeled after Neo4j using pointers, protocols, and other features learned from sessions at the conference. Let&rsquo;s:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Make the graph safe and performant using the Unsafe APIs where necessary
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Take advantage of Swift&rsquo;s functional programming to traverse and query the graph using Sequence and Collection
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Compare performance of querying a large dataset between the graph and CoreData.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    This project aims to push the limits of Swift using many of its great features!

                    It builds an in-memory graph that can be traversed.

                    I ran into challenges architecting the graph, choosing whether or not to use protocols
