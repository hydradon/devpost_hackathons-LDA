                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've heard lots horror stories about bad roommates-- we want to end these horror stories and turn finding a random roommate into finding a friend. Many first-year students at Pitt use Facebook to find roommates, but it is essentially a one-way match-- you can't know that you both are compatible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When users first log in to the app, they fill out a questionnaire about themselves and about what they are seeking in a roommate. It then presents them with profiles that fit their criteria. Users then can check yes or no, and if both click yes, they're a match. Matches can then exchange contact information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio, which integrates Java code and XML markup.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of the team was unfamiliar with version control software, and we had to get used to sharing code as a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had created an app or been to a hackathon before, and we made a functional user interface and mock-ups of future features. We experienced the design process as a team, including taking into account the needs of the user and making decisions about the app. Finally, we applied our knowledge of Java from classes to a project in real life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Android Studio and test our app's interface on an emulator. We gained a better understanding of why apps are set up the way they are. In addition, we learned to break down tasks and distribute them among team members.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Room.Me
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd like to develop more features, including facilitating social interactions between potential matches, as well as reaching a broader audience, including apartment-hunters and subletters.
