                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's never enough time. Sometimes we really want to take care of ourselves, but forget to when things get busy. We wanted to create an application that helps people track and visualize their moods without using up extensive resources and time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    M.O.O.D. is a simple app that tracks your mood on a daily basis and visualizes it on a colourful and intuitive dashboard. It only requires 30 seconds of a user's time per day as it merely requires a date and a mood rating on a scale of 1 to 5.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We implemented the user interface in Android Studio and the logic is handled in Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent more time than expected familiarizing ourselves with Android Studio because this was our first time using it. We had technical issues during set up (e.g. not enough disk space) and had to troubleshoot/pivot quickly to unblock ourselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to jump into Android Studio for the first time and being able to learn quickly, solve problems, and support each other along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to build things quickly under time pressure and solve problems. We learned to use Git better to help us maintain an organized project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for M.O.O.D(Mark One Off Daily)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our vision for future implementations is building a visual dashboard that supports accessibility colour themes and recommending articles/resources for users based on aggregate data of their mood over time.
