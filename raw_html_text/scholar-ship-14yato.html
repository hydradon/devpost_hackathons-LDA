                    We have 2 university students in our team, and 2 grade 11 students.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Our Problem
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have been told that finding scholarships nowadays could be both difficult and discouraging due to scholarships being scattered everywhere and just simply have no motivation to apply. There has also been an issue where most scholarships are only available to Americans and not a lot available to Canadians thus the reason why our target audience are Canadians. We're aware that when most people are searching for scholarships, it's very difficult to find one that suits them (some scholarships asks for things like females only, religion, etc.)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Our Solution
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to create an app, where users are able to create their own customizable profile, and based on their profiles, we will send them all the scholarships that are available to them. That way, the scholarships will not be scattered everywhere and will just be in one place. We decided to make an app and not the website because we want the consumers to be able to access the app anywhere and anytime on their phones. We also realized that most people won't be able to keep track of how many scholarships they would like to apply and when they'll be due, and so we have a favorites feature, in which, they'll be able to click on the tab and apply for those that they have favorited, that way it'll be easier for the consumer to access instead of having to scroll through all the different scholarships. We will also be giving out notifications at least once a day reminding the applicants that there are an x about of days to apply for those that have not applied to the scholarships that they have favorited because we know as students, it can get really busy and hectic due to all the schoolwork and extracurriculars we would have to do. In order to motivate and encouraged the students to apply and use our apps, we will be creating a points system, in which for every 4 essays they have written, they'll earn 100 points which is equivalent to a dollar. However, the applicants are only able to withdraw the money once they have reached 1500 points. We understand that it is a long way, so we decided to put ads in our app to promote some companies, and in return, they'll provide the applicants with swags in between the 0-1500 points. That way, they'll be applying for scholarships while earning some money. Towards the end, we'll be congratulating those that have got accepted to the scholarships they have applied and to those that have written their application.
