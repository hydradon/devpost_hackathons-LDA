                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a robots.txt file by hand is tedious, especially if the person creating the file does not remember all the endpoints of their website. Automating this process saves a significant amount of time and energy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creates a robots.txt file through the command line by either crawling the entire website of interest or by manually providing a user input.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We collaborated on this project and wrote it in Python. We all took on different roles to collectively produce the final result we have now.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to change the design several times because we realized that some ideas we initially thought of was beyond the scope of the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a python package that is on the test server so that we use pip to install it. We also had a good distribution of work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned how to work together on a challenging yet motivating problem, learned to plan out our time in order to finish by a deadline, learned to change plans along the way when certain problems proved to be unfeasible.
                </p>

                    What's next for Robottxt
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improved user interface and full user control over the state of each endpoint.
