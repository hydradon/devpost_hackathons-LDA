                    Every semester, Temple College of Science and Technology students are sent a large and cumbersome spreadsheet containing the research opportunities for the upcoming semester. The 79-page document is inefficient and not easy to navigate. We set out to create a website which would organize the listings by category and offer useful links for browsers. The links include hyperlinks to RateMyProfessor pages, Google scholar citations, and personal websites.

                    We both started with almost not research experience today, but we successfully created a usable website using html, css, and javascript. We were ran into challenges with using GitHub, the toggle bar, and formatting the web.
