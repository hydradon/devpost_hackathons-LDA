                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes you wanna build something serious, and sometimes you just wanna build something fun. This was one of the latter times.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Goatify is a web app that takes a midi file from the user, creates an mp3 using custom soundfont files from goat bleats, and returns it to the user in what can only be described as an audio visual presentation to blow your mind
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user starts on the website, which is built in html, css, and javascript, and hosted on AWS. Once the user submits a file, it is posted to a bucket in S3, which then triggered an AWS SNS message that was added to queue to wait for processing. We have a separate backend server on aws that handles the logic from normal midi to goat mp3, which posts to another s3 bucket when the processing is complete. The backend is built in python, and uses the fluidsynth library for some of the heavy lifting in audio conversion. The frontend then loads the processed mp3, and delivers the music to the user.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Running an audio processing backend on a server that doesn't have a soundcard
-Creating custom instruments for midi 
-complex javascript triggered by audio events
                </p>

                <p>
                    -Linux audio processing is a complex and often messy space
-Sharpened skills in hosting a project on AWS
