                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We both wanted to be able to access our photos and music on our servers from anywhere we wanted, and this was a free and simpler solution compared to Plex Media Server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Covalence shares your music or photos from the specified directories in covalence.conf and organizes it on a WebUI that can be served using nginx, apache, or any webserver.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially started building with flask + sqlalchemy + postgresql, but we realized that we wanted Covalence to be more lightweight and not necessarily require a backend to function, as it would make it more dynamic and portable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into problems figuring out how to best organize the media in a way that the front end would be able to easily read data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of implementing a system that generates metadata.json files for each individual music or photo library and the javascript that parses the metadata.json in each directory for the files and serves them on the WebUI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use flask, and we learned some more about postgresql.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for covalence
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We may implement authentication sometime in the future, as well as optimizing the code and improvements to the UI.
