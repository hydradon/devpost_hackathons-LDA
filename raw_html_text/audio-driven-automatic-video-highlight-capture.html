                    It was a 5:30 video, we summarized it into a 1:00 highlight video!
                </p>

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Videos could be long and tedious, so we created an automatic routine to capture the highlight of videos.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Capture the highlights of a long video using audio clues, then concatenate the highlights into one short video.
A streamline of the procedure:
Input a long video -&gt; capture the audio file -&gt; analyze the audio file to produce an array of energy level for each 50ms -&gt; calculate the clusters of high-energy intervals according to the array -&gt; produce an array of time stamps for such intervals -&gt; concat the subclips into a highlight video.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use PyAudioAnalysis to calculate the energy level for each 50ms
Use this information to iteratively find the best clips of the video
The rules are: no more than x low energy blocks; at least y high energy blocks; at most z percent low energy blocks in each clip
concatenate the clips into one highlight video
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An ideal highlight clip is hard to define and hard to implement
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully quantitatively defined a highlight clip.
We successfully programmed the logic to find such ideal highlight clips
Using SVM models from GitHub, we analyzed the emotion and distinguished speech from music, which can be extended into a better product in the future.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned to use python to effectively do video analysis and editing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Audio-driven Automatic Video Highlight Capture
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Could implement a User Interface;
Reduce manual procedures;
Could explore more functions we can achieve using the strong tools;
