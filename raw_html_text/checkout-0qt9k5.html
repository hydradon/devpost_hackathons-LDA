                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the numerous online retailers that offered a bundle and buy option right on the product page. Now, although their platform may not be digital, technology can be brought to traditional brick and mortar stores to help merge the speed of online shopping and bundling with in person experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app scans the name of a phone on display in store and helps to show the reviews on the product, along with up to 3 accessory products. This can help in promoting buying a phone and accessories in a bundle all at once, and makes it much easier for a customer to see the kinds of accessories and reviews the phone they are looking at with only the name.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our app in android studio, making use of AR kit sceneform for the 3d environment and tracking, and firebase vision kit ocr for text recognition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had issues installing the AR libraries and getting firebase fully set up within our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to get the app to show and keep track of older cards.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to integrate web based data with AR technology in order to speed up the

                        checkout

                    What's next for Checkout
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integration with the T-Mobile website and database of devices in order to allow for usage in any store for any product. There is also room for integration with store stock so that devices unavailable locally are shown as such.
