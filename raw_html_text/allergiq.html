                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Akhil's sister has many severe food allergies, so we were inspired to solve this issue for her and the millions of other people suffering from similar allergies.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you open the app, you first input your food allergies. Then, the app will process
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Flutter and Google Cloud Platform. We all worked on different components of the app, and then Jason combined all the parts into a finished app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many issues using GCP, since we hadn't used RESTful API in Flutter prior to this. We also had issues with Github, as some of our Android Studios did not recognize the repository as a Flutter project.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the entire application :)

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned much more about Flutter and also how to better implement RESTful API.
