                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ive wanted to see what I could build solo in 24 hrs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its a videogame with PC android and Browser support
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used GameMaker Studio 2, Graphics Gale &amp; Aseprite(graphics), Visual Studio(data), and Cubase 10 (music) I wrote all of the code, designed 90% of the artwork, and composed the music.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Writing the random dungeon generator code. I had to make certain each level was solvable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I didn't sleep , I built a project to 90% completion solo. And I helped some other teams that were designing games too
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rest is very important. Towards the end could barely type :) I may have been able to implement a lot more if I had a partner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Duneoneer: Granny's Big Favor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Probably not much (work and school take most of my time)  Id like more time to improve the AI and write more music.
                </p>
