                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout the conference I was inspired by the dream to unlock crypto for underserved communities. There is true power in increasing diversity in this space. The problem I see is that onboarding these communities into crypto is a mess right now
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was unable to form a team so in the true hackathon spirit my entry is a keynote that goes over my idea. In the future it will be a framework that will empower all developers to use this metaphor. The power to unlock starts with open source ideas
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used keynote to describe and detail my vision
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unable to find a team, I wasn't able to build a proof of concept or MVP
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of myself for even submitting this idea, because it sounds crazy to submit a keynote to a hackathon. I am so empowered by this concept that I feel like I have to share it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You may not always be in a position to build your idea or feel like you can even get started. Simply sharing your idea and message is a powerful way to build confidence and light the path forward.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Safety Deposit Box
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Build an MVP to share with users and do lots of testing. I need to determine if this is a good idea just to me, or if it resonates with the communities I am working to serve
                </p>
