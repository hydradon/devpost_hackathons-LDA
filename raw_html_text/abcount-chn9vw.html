                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the added emphasis of safety on college campuses, there is a clear and obvious need to develop a platform to ensure that all students return home safe. In this project, we set out just to do so. Human capital is an expensive resource for universities, so we created an app which can simulate a companion for walking home.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pebble application that prompts the user to 'check-in' after fixed length of time or a contact will be notified via SMS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The code for the pebble was coded and build in the CloudPebble web IDE.  This provided a very simple way to code/build/deploy our work on our pebble devices.  Once the web IDE was setup, building and deploying was as easy as clicking a button.  However, this IDE proved to be difficult for collaboration.  Since the code was hosted on the cloud servers, we had no way to use our own source control.  This meant that we had to rely on the GitHub integration in CloudPebble, which is not designed for multiple developers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the pebble app was being built, the companion Android app was being built in Android Studio.  We found that the integration between pebble and android was very seamless.  The packages were easy to include and use in the android app.
                </p>
