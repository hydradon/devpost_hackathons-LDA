                <p>
                    A board game using blocks that can be 3d printed. The entire game is made of small pieces, which can be made relatively quickly on a low-spec 3d printer. The game itself uses randomisation of pieces and uses, and 3 phases of play (Build, Mine, Run).
Build- the players build the board out of the blocks available. The blocks are platonic solid shapes, ranging from 4 sided and up. These can be fitted together into the "Asteroid" to be mined. 
After the board is built, the blocks are assigned values. This prevents any attempt to rig the board in favour of a particular player.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mine- Using your drone, you mine blocks from  the asteroid. These are used to upgrade your ship and drone for faster and more efficient mining, and for points at the end of the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Run- Get your cargo back to base, as quick as you can, avoiding your fellow players who are busy trying to knock you out of space!

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basic design was back-of-a-napkin style. Then some search for a suitable setup for shapes and ways to create the models. After a quick tutorial on 3d modelling software, and abandoning Blender as too damn hard, I used 123Design and some basic shapes downloaded from Thingiverse. 
These were modified to have pegs and holes for connecting the blocks, and prototype shapes were then sent to the 3d printers. Here's hoping they come back as something usable.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Never having used 3d modelling software, I had no idea what I was doing. Still kinda don't, although now I can make holes. I made holes! In things, obviously. Not just by themselves.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I made a hole! Also getting the models up and running in a usable fashion. And then finding  out that I could have done it all much quicker and easier another way.

                    3D modelling, printing, and how to beg the 3d printer guys for help.

                    Re-work the basic prototypes, playtest, refine the rule system, check for incompatible shapes. Do another set of models, rinse and repeat. 
Once the shapes are down and the rule set is balanced, do a separate design set using magnets instead of pegs to connect he blocks. Multi side shapes with multiple magnets should be interesting for board kits that can be purchased, rather than constructed from a board design downloaded at home. 
Also looking at high end sets made of different metal finishes for the different blocks. 
Design for the rule book and player items.
Redesign of the rule book for the Dwarf Mountain version, where the board is built with some limitations and player interactions are different.
