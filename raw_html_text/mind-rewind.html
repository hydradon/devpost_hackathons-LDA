                    The device takes EEG feedback from neural sensors and analyzes the alpha, beta, gamma, and delta waves to construct an "attention" score which is displayed on the LCD screen. Based on this score, the user can determine whether they should re-read the pages with the lowest scores. Every time the user finishes a page, they press the designated button for which the average score is logged along with the page. Then the program starts recording brainwave data for the next page. The device is turned on, starting page is entered, and the device is turned off through the designated iPhone app.

                    We first stripped the apart a child's toy that contained EEG sensors and rewired them through our own (smaller) circuitboard. This board was the main hub between the bluetooth module, EEG sensors, and LCD screen.

                    We had issues with button interactions, bluetooth module, and implementing the algorithm.
