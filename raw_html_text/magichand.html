                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to help everyone to be able to communicate with each other.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Translates sign-language into American-English audio
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use the camera to record the movements of the hands. Then we use machine learning and computer vision to match the patterns with English words.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Limited time and hardware resources
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us are new to computer vision and machine learning and with time and technology limit, we could still be able to reach our goal
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through trials and errors, we've learned how different kinds of computer vision and machine learning algorithms work and successfully apply those algorithms to our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MagicHand
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will continue in this research project to increase the number of words in the dictionary and make the recognition more stable. Our goal is to help as many people as possible.
