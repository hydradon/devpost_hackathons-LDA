                    But How Does It Work?!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used TensorFlow to create an LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) Neural Network that reads all of the lyrics of any musical artist. The network learns the style of how the artist writes &ndash;&nbsp;the context of words, rhymes, line/stanza breaks, etc. Given a seed word or phrase, it will generate a new song in that artist's style.
