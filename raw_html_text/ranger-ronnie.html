                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired from an app in which the amount of water you consumed is logged in so that you are able to use the same amount to water a virtual plant.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It calculates the amount of waste you consume, through the virtual care of a raccoon. The more waste that you log in, the more dirty his environment gets.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My team and I first started off using xcode in order to have a visual of what our application would look like, as well as GitHub in order to be able to collaborate on it as a team. We also used google slides as another resource to further explain our vision of working towards zero waste
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My team and I come from no programming background, so learning how to use new languages such as Java and Swift was difficult, as well as trying to figure out how to work with GitHub, since our teammate with windows didn't have access to it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A clear and descriptive idea of how to make it fun to learn how to .better keep track and decrease the amount of waste we produce
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Youtube and companies present were a great source to kearn how to use new platforms and some coding in less than a couple of hours!
