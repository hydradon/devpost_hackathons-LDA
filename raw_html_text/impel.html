                    InspirationTest  - We were inspired by fact that a lot of youth is not educated in programming at a younger age, as it is often made not accessible to younger minds. In order to try to accomplish that, we simplified concepts way down, and then made a game that uses technology that a lot of children have access to.

                <h2>
                    What it does - This phone application teaches the youth about the basic concepts of programming by first taking them through some lessons with checkup questions. When they get through all the lessons, they can choose to play a mixed reality game that uses the iPhone's camera to test their knowledge. This game turns a real life deck of playing cards into multiple choice questions to learn.

                <h2>
                    How I built it - We used the Unity engine to build out the entire application. We spent the first night planning the game out, and the next morning learning unity. Then half of us worked on the GUI and Lessons part of the game, while the other half worked on the mixed reality part of the game. Then as we finished each, we combined the two.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into - Some of the challenges we ran into were understanding our capabilities and our limits in how much we could work with MR since none of us had any experience with it previously. None of us had also worked with the Unity engine before, so we needed to learn what we would need to use in our application.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of - We are very proud of the aesthetic appeal and presentation we have, as well as our ability to learn and apply a lot of knowledge in order to implement MR.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned - We learned a lot about how to use Unity and about the amount of time that goes into planning out the program. We also learned how necessary it is for a program to have a very specific goal.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for IMPEL - In the future, we would like to implement different game modes like timed or a multiplayer mode component. We would also like to expand the lessons, not only covering more concepts, but having less words written and instead more videos.
