                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Often times, we had noticed that parties and get-togethers were plagued by weak speakers or no speakers what so ever. This sometimes led to awkward levels of quiet at social gatherings. Another issue we had is that currently, the host puts on their music and often refuses to allow anyone else to control it. This does not allow people to jam out to their favorite tunes when they should be able to. Another inspiration was our dread for setting up synchronized speakers. Having to synchronize multiple speakers throughout the house is a massive hassle and removes from time that should be spent hanging out with friends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pocket DJ allows any individual with the party code to add songs of their choice to the music queue. Pocket DJ also synchronizes playback on any device hosting the player.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Octave-Group api for accessing songs for the player. Javascript was used for the back-end. Angular with Material Design was used for the front-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Octave-Group api is underdeveloped but for the scope of the challenge we felt it was important to use instead of a more fleshed-out api like the one offered by Spotify. This caused us to not have access to a lot of the valuable features offered by the Spotify api.
