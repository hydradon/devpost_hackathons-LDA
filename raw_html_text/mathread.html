                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Vitaliy Vertogradov - Ph.D. in Mathematics, conducts research in the field of black holes and gravitational collapse. He is completely blind, therefore a special program reads the plain text to him, and difficulties arise with formulas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vitaly was looking for volunteers who can read books with formulas. But we want to offer him a new revolutionary solution - an application that could voice the formulas for him.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a Chrome Extension and an Android App that voices formulas on the web page and pdf documents that are not voiced by the regular text-to-speech algorithms
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our algorithm finds all of the equation images in the documents or/and web pages and voices them app by parsing through image with Google Vision API, convert image into a text and voice the text with Google Text to Speech API. We created a Google Chrome extension using JavaScript and HTML. For the mobile app, we used Android studio and Figma for the frontend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating the python algorithm into the javascript file of the extension was the greatest challenge we faced. There were no open source solutions we could find.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MathRead
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building an API that will convert images into LaTex objects and API that will convert LaTex objects into a text to improve the recognition of complex mathematical symbols.
