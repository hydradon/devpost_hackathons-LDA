                        While choosing an idea, one of us commented on hating how images don't go to a directory for images and that we have to consistently move it manually. Since it's a hackathon... it became the idea!

                        This is a chrome extension that allows the user to organize whatever they download. The user specifies certain keywords or files that they want to organize when downloaded  and where they want the files to be. As soon as you download an image, the extension automatically places the downloaded file in the route specified.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -There are 4 main key files we needed. We had the icon file, manifest file, HTML file, and js file. We mainly focused on the javascript and used it to store specifications which we would run later when a picture was downloaded. We also utilized React and Node.js/ Typescript, making well over 20 files. to streamline the process.
                </p>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We had many problems during the later stages of the project. We had the data the user provided in the background and activated the script when the user downloaded something. Unfourtunelty, our js functions weren't able to run and we found a solution by mapping certain types to functions.

                    -Don't bite off more than you can chew. We made the extension very flexible and with multiple options, however, that gave us a lot of work and debugging to do.
