                    <li>
                        Using our knowledge of sustainable fashion followed by further research, we gathered the information necessary to implement our site. Then, using various web languages including PHP, MYSQL, HTML,  and Javascript, we built a platform with which to spread our knowledge.

                        Finding accurate and thorough data about current recycling and manufacturing processes. While also sorting through the data and picking proper end uses and what those end uses mean for sustainability.

                    <li>
                        We learned about the complex but fruitful relationship that can occur when students come together to work across disciplinary lines. In this case, using knowledge from fashion, economics, environmental science, and -perhaps most importantly- computer science.

                    <li>
                        Connecting with fashion companies so that we can have first source data about manufacturing processes and materials. We would implement a code system that they could print on the tag and the consumer would be able to look the code up on the app while shopping. This would also allow us to factor in information about fair wages in factories and potential zero waste designs when calculating company sustainability ratings.
