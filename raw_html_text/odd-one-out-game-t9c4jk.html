                    Inspiration -
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game was a favourite of mine as a child and I realised that there was no skill currently like it on the Alexa skill store.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does -
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a simple game where the objective is to find the odd one out. You will be given 10 questions each with three items, you have to decide which one is the odd one out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into -
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When trying to test it I ran into a problem of not being able to invoke the skill when the langue was set to English(US), I fixed this by also setting the language to English(UK)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Odd One Out Game -
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are many more categories on the way for the game along with extra items in the existing ones, and possibly the addition of picture round for the echo show when I get a chance to play around with one.
