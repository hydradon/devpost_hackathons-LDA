                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many productivity apps lose sight of simplicity and focus on the quality of important features, leading to cluttered workspaces that disrupt workflow and overall a worse experience. We aimed for a simple interface to provide a clear task overview.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    CitrusTrack takes the basic functionality of what a to-do list application should have, and organizes the user&rsquo;s information in an easy-to-read list. Users are able to create events with a name and a set amount of time they want to give themselves to accomplish the task, encouraging goal-oriented productivity. Users are then able to choose a task and keep an eye on the animated timer on the screen before the timer runs out, or the user cancels the session.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CitrusTrack is mainly comprised of HTML and CSS components, ranging from Bootstrap and self-written design. Javascript handles the creation and deletion of events that allow the user to constantly keep track of incoming tasks.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using such a large range of HTML and CSS external sources made management of style priority extra difficult. As the number of resources used increased, style inconsistencies became harder to track down.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We wanted to integrate with the Google Tasks API but we couldn't get it working on our localhost. We decided to get the project working by keeping track of the tasks by ourselves.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    Even though I have little to no experience with web design intended to look pleasing, I feel that I was able to take a step in the right direction with the graphic design choices I made throughout the creation of the images and page layouts.

                    We have a working prototype. This is the first hackathon for some of our team members.

                    Keep the project scope simple. We had a lot of ideas but cut it down to the minimum viable product.

                    Janine: This was my first time experiencing web development not only from the front-end, but also the back-end. In doing so, I discovered the vast capabilities different kinds of approaches to creating web applications.

                    With further sophistication in the management of user tasks, CitrusTrack will focus on improving overall responsiveness of the site, and may explore new features to add (such as ambient noise) while staying true to the minimal and simplistic goal of the project. We want to add a background based on the current time of day and weather to increase the ambiance for the user.
