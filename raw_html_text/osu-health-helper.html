                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As the World Health Organization (WHO) has begun to recognize Gaming Disorder as an official mental disorder, we hope to improve the lifestyles of those who may fall into gaming addiction by promoting healthy living, particularly for a game as physically taxing as "osu!"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Combining user information such as current play session time and average beats per minute (bpm) per level, we devised an algorithm that will calculate the appropriate time to prompt the user via Discord to take a break from the game. At this point, the user can also use the bot to ask for suggestions for stretches that will optimize game performance once they continue gaming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Utilizing the osu! API, we extracted user information from  profiles to determine whether or not they should be taking a break. We also used discord.js to easily interact with the discord API to successfully send messages
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By far the hardest obstacle we ran into was trying to figure out a way to send the messages. Although we were able to extract the data and make observations for gamers, we lacked a way of communication.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the osu! API and successfully grabbing data is something we are proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We experienced one of our first uses of an API, and it provided strong foundations for future projects. We also got to learn more about python and javascript in the process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for osu-Health-Helper
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next would be to allow more user customization in how they approach the bot.
