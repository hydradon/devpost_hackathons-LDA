                    I wanted to learn something about using graphics libraries. It's something I've wanted for a long time. I had ambitions of building a big game, but ran into problems.

                    How I built it

                    Used python with the pygame library.

                    I started with trying to get a graphics environment in C++ using OpenGl. Being not very familiar with external libraries and linking, etc., it took several hours of installing, reinstalling messing with .lib and .h files, and compliling to get it working. Then I discovered that it was quite hard to learn and not very good for my purposes. SFML was tried next, with a couple more hours of unsuccessful attempts. Finally, I moved to python with pygame, which was much easier. (Just like xkcd.com/353/ !)

                    Finally getting a working model in python after failing in C++ was a huge relief.

                    Graphics in C++ are hard!
