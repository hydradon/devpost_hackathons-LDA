                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The reason why we chose to pick this topic as our IOS Application is because we know that Domestic Violence is not only something that women face but is also something that anyone of any gender can go through. Through this project, we hope to raise awareness of this issue as it is becoming more and more prevalent.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application allows for not only Domestic Violence victims to receive help, but also spreads awareness to almost anyone who wants to aid the cause.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used many different languages for our final project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For our IOS Application we used Xcode and Swift and learned the language in less than 12 hours and coded the entire application from scratch. 
For our Website we used Sublime Text as text editor and Github pages for our website hosting. The website was used to accompany the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were initially clueless about using Xcode as it was very overwhelming, but together as a team we overcame this hardship and succeeded in building our first IOS Application.
