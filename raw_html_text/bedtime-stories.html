                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've got 4 kids and they love both Alexa and bedtime stories. So what it better than to combine the two and have Alexa tell interactive bedtime stories.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It tells a bedtime story and askes at several points in the story how it shall turn out. It remembers the decisions and alters the story accordingly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on a Node.js example by Amazon I've created a state machine that maintains the state.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tracking state with the Alexa session model.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    German and English translation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Interactive speech design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bedtime stories
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More stories. I already have the content layed out. Also native speakers as Alexa sounds too robotic for my kids. I already have professional speakers and equipment, but no time before the deadline to finish it.
