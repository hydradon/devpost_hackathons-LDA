                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My parents pushed me hard to succeed at schooling. Because of that, I was able to take math courses far above my grade. I want to make sure that every elementary student on Earth has the same opportunities that I had, and I think I have the power to do that through coding the kind of games that I used to enjoy as a kid.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game wades elementary students into the concepts behind calculus. Without even mentioning the word limits, it displays how, as intervals get thinner and thinner, results become more accurate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I started with the designs first, since I wanted a good, whole picture of what I was planning to do (and because I couldn't code without proper models). I worked on coding, then with the truck and the backgrounds, and finally I inserted a bonus level that didn't quite seem to work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity has several dozen unlikeable quirks. For example, to select a text box, you can't hover over the grey prompt text. I had to face and defeat those challenges, lest I wanted to start from scratch (or Scratch. Scratch is a seriously undervalued program). Also, there are considerably few programs that measure out polynomials and then let you save them individually, so I had to look at pixel count more often than I would have liked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is one of the best looking games that I've ever made, and I feel like the steps I took to teach potential players are fairly straight forward.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Economists can code, too!
                </p>

                    What's next for Newton Park
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I felt that it would be cool to make the game three-dimensional to introduce students to three-dimensional calculus. I also wanted to do derivatives, differential equations, and sinusoidal work.
