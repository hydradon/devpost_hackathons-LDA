                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hoped to design a product that brought the ease and comfort of the command line to all users, developers and consumers alike. The simplicity and ease of the terminal allow developers to optimize efficiency, and we desired to replicate the same efficiency in everyday consumers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our product integrates services (currently Google Calendar, Google Maps, and Skype) into a single location, allowing users to create events, find directions, and video call someone with only a few keyboard presses. The DoEverythingBar simplifies daily chores and let's users do powerful actions in just seconds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The design for our website was done using HTML and CSS. To embed the three services we used in this program, we integrated the Google APIs and the Skype API in JavaScript into our product. We also used the OAuth 2.0 API to ensure that users can safely sign-in to the Google Accounts and allow our product to add events to their Google Calendar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We often ran into the challenge of successfully integrating the various APIs. It was also difficult to maintain a simplistic design while having powerful functions on our website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we created a product for all consumers to use in their daily lives, from adding an event to their calendars to organize their day to getting directions to their destination.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use various APIs and integrate them seamlessly into our product. We also learned about the extensive documentation that Google provides for developers to take advantage of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DoEverythingBar
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to integrate even more services onto our platform, such as instant messaging, FaceTime, Google Translate, etc. We also want to make our product smarter, so user errors in typing commands will still allow the product to function properly. We can do this by expanding our keyword dictionary and creating smarter functions to handle requests.
