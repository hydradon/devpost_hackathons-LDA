                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the 20 Questions game but when we realized it was a neural network and none of us have coded before, we decided to scale it back into a much smaller operation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game is prepared with questions that can figure out which SEC school you're thinking of based on the district, colors, whether or not their mascot is an animal, and what state they are in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was built in python to run on a smarti pi touch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a team member run into a medical emergency so we lost half of our team for the second half of the project
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coding something like this is incredibly long without switch statements, using something other than python would probably be a good option next time.
                </p>
