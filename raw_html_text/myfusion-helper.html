                <p>
                    To provide a more affordable way to get much needed extensions to the marketplace that were reasonably priced so that any Infusionsoft user could afford them.

                    Product Overview
Ever try to use Zapier and just feel like it only got you 70% of what you needed? Or need one "must have" feature and find that that single feature costs you $79 a month or more?
                </p>
                <p>
                    MyFusion Helper was built out of necessity. You see, first and foremost, we are Infusionsoft users ourselves. We own three different businesses running on three apps ourselves, and as an Infusionsoft Certified Partner, we have helped and supported 100's of Infusionsoft clients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What we saw was a problem in the industry - a void. Campaign Builder is incredibly powerful, but it does leave us all wanting certain features, extensions or "extras". The problem is that in the Infusionsoft market space, it seems that most apps solve just a single problem and charge a premium price.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our solution?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our mission is to provide hundreds of the most popular and needed extensions all in one "gotta have" library that is as simple to use as it is powerful. While we don't have 100's of helpers yet, we do have more than 30 and growing, and have already become the largest collection of Infusionsoft specific extensions available.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are adding features on a frequent basis, with new helpers being released monthly. If you don't find what you need, then just contact us at our helpdesk and let us know what you need - help [at] myfusionsolutions.com.

Frequently Asked Questions
Do I have to be a programmer to use this?
Absolutely not! Just because we are doesn't mean you should be (or even want to be) and we know that. MyFusion Helper provides a very simple and elegant interface and instructional videos for each helper so that you're never lost.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How long does it take to setup?
There are only two piece of data that we need in order to be up and running - the Infusionsoft app name and API key. We have a simple video to walk you through doing it yourself in under 2 minutes! Or if you need help, we can always assist you via the helpdesk - help [at] myfusionsolutions.com
                </p>
                <p>
                    Is this fixed or tiered usage-based pricing?
For now, it's fixed pricing. No increase in the monthly based on usage (other than for text messaging). As we grow, however, we fully expect that we will have to charge more based on usage. However, when prices are raised, existing subscribers will NOT be affected.
                </p>

                    </em>
                    add new helpers?
We're adding new helpers to the app on a weekly basis at this point as we see so many needs in the industry. While we can't promise that pace forever, we'll certainly be adding features at least on a monthly basis for the foreseeable future.
