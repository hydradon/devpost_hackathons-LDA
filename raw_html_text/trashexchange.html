                    TrashExchange seeks to reduce waste by promoting recycling through awareness of the value of recyclable goods. We want to make this process as easy as possible by making your only job to recycle and we&rsquo;ll take care of the rest!
Recycling is a low priority for many people because it is easier to throw everything into the garbage regardless of recyclability. We throw away plastic, paper/cardboard, metal, glass and plastic bags creating unnecessary waste on reusable products. We&rsquo;re essentially throwing money away!
TrashExchange is a solution to incentivize recycling by creating a consciousness about the price of recyclable items. How TrashExchange works is each recyclable item is worth a certain amount of points that can then be exchanged for gift cards! When you reach a certain amount of items you can request a pickup and we&rsquo;ll connect you to a pickup service. lt&rsquo;s an Uber service for recyclables but youre getting paid to do it!
Members of the TrashExchange community would collect and separate recyclable items and log them on TrashExchange. When you reach a minimum amount, you are then able to request a pickup. TrashExchange will record this request and connect it to a collection service. Once the package is picked up and verified against our database, the corresponding points will be credited to your account. That&rsquo;s it you&rsquo;re set to spend it in our shop for giftcards or continue saving up!

                    Some challenges we faced were with node and react framework due to lack of knowledge. As well as Google API Services.
