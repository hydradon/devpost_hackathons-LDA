                    Welcome to Public Playlist, code named Project Falcon!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our goal coming into the Hackathon was to learn a bunch of new things and have a lot of fun. Neither of us had an idea coming and after a few hours of brainstorming we decided to create Public Playlist. The goal of this website was solve a common problem we identified which was when multiple people are together everyone wants to listen to their playlist for music.With Public Playlist everyone can vote and the highest voted songs get played.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used Spotify API and AWS to create the website. As well as Python, Flask, HTML, and CSS. Neither of us had any revelent knowledge in these tools. Through this project we accomplished our goals of learning and having fun.
