                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a busy guy and I don't always have time to study as much as I would like to. If I can use my Google Assistant to get a little extra studying in while I'm getting dressed or cleaning my room, it's a big win for me and my grades.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's quizlet for voice. I've been wanting to take advantage of voice assistants in order to improve my study habits for a long time and this is just the start.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Cognigy.AI, the premier enterprise level conversational AI platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It turns out that Google Homes cannot connect to Cornell University Wi-Fi, so it was hard to create a full demo of how learn space could help. Using it on my phone does not really demonstrate how it improves on a pre-existing website or app like quizlet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Learn Space for Google Assistant
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, I envision Learn Space to be an AI powered study buddy. I envision an assistant that can tell you what you need to study based on the concept of spaced learning. You don't need to study the same set everyday, study a new set once, then the next day, then two days later, then four days later. Keep on going like this and learn the material while studying smart not hard. Today's pedagogy understands that spaced learning is the best way to remember for the long term. I'm not in college to cram for tests, I'm in college to learn and become an educated person.
