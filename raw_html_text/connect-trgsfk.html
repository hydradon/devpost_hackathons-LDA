                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tired of the typical quest of obtaining the Wifi password when entering a new venue, we set out to change that. While building out our idea, we realized the lack of automated on-site information booths where one could quickly get all the information they need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connect is an Android app that allows you to easily share information through NFC data transfer. Connect turns your standard smartphone into a tap terminal, and allows other devices to easily get the information you need. Our mobile app will log you into the venue's wifi, as well as download all the relevant information pertaining to you. We also have a content management system that allows users to control which pieces of data our app will transfer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our mobile experience using Java in Android Studio. Our content management system was created using vue.js, Google Firebase, and nuxtjs for tracking all the different data points, as well as users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Version control with Android Studio was incredibly difficult as each of our machines required different dependency settings. This resulted in a lot of frustration among our group members as the software would often fail on us for no reason. Another challenge we ran into was managing all the different deliverables we wanted to hit in such a short amount of time, and how to integrate all of our changes seamlessly into one application.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are incredibly proud of how polished we were able to make our project with all of the technical hurdles we faced. We are also proud at how quickly we were able to learn a completely new programming language in such a short amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having a deployment pipeline set up before we write a single line of code is incredibly important for rapid development. Another lesson we learned was that brainstorming is crucial to flushing out ideas. Having everyone on the same page before we dive headfirst into a problem let us think critically on what we would be working on, and how to approach each challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Connect
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Future plans we have for Connect would be to implement a smart lock system where users would be able to grant temporary access to locked areas through our app. Another feature we would like to add to our project would porting our app over to iOS and implementing cross-platform compatibility.
