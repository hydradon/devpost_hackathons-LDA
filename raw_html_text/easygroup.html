                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    College students find themselves with too much to do and too little time. Many people try to schedule their time around their homework, but we decided to create a way to spend less time on homework. Introducing EasyGroup. A new, fun way for students to collaborate with their peers on homework, projects, or studying.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EasyGroup allows students to get into groups based on the classes they are enrolled in. They can easily create a group with recurring meeting dates, occasional meeting dates, or just online questions based on their needs. Once they organize with the app, they can meet in person or in the case of commuters, online. Students working in a group setting can have their homework questions answered immediately by their peers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, CSS, and javascript. Out of four CSS files we used, one is a font style sheet, one a formatting sheet, one a icon sheet, and the last one a miscellaneous sheet that we created. We started off with some open-source templates from w3-schools and heavily modified them to become a minimum viable product for EasyGroup.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were some font conflicts between CSS files that we created and open source ones that we used.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also initially had a different color scheme but felt it did not represent our school, so we changed it to the signature red and gray.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With Zachary being an electrical engineering major in his second semester, he went into the challenge with very little website design experience. In only two short days, he has learned the basics of HTML and CSS. Jordan, a computer science major, came in already knowing a decent amount of HTML and CSS. After the website was finished, he realized his skills went up a level and he is now even more proficient in web design than he was before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes a long time to get a little done. Once you get a part done, you have to modify your old work so much that it is basically new code. Repeat for two days and get a basic web app that shows what you want the finalized web app to be.
