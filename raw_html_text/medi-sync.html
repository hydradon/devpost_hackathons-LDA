                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Medical records are important documents for both medical and legal reasons. However, many institutions still keep them on physical documents which are often very difficult to manage and are can be prone to being lost. Medi-sync aims to resolve this problem by creating an easy user-friendly platform where users can see their personal health progress and share medical data with doctors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Medi-sync is a platform that doubles as a health tracker for the user and a medical portfolio for the user. Fitbit data as well as past medical data is shown, this allows the user to see their overall health at a quick glance.Their portfolio is then stored in a database which can be accessed by both the users and medical professionals. This allows for an alternative to physical medical records that is user-friendly and easily accessible.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front end architecture was build using only HTML, CSS and Javascript. Javascript libraries such as ChartJs were used for interactive elements such as graphs. The Fitbit api was used to receive user data from fitbit accounts. The backend is built on node.js and express.js. Firebase is used as a database to store user profiles.
