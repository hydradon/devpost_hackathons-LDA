                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It started as a test to see if I could use Express to access and serve APIs using browser location. Then it became my first attempt at an Alexa skill. Now I've added a visual component using APL to complement the voice response.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tells you where you can buy a gyro
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The skill is currently live without a visual component, relying on Lambda-based Node. Because of issues I encountered with several failed re-certification attempts (and to experiment with the newly-available Ruby Lambda offering) I re-wrote the Lambda functionality in Ruby, adding APL functionality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Couldn't find the robust (official) Alexa-specific SDK libraries for Ruby as I have used for JavaScript, so I had to create a lot of request/response functionality myself.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Alexa can struggle to correctly interpret my wake phrase ("I need a gyro"), specifically because of issues with hearing "gyro" as "euro". This appears to have been a signifiant issue with certification attempts this time around.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        APL took me some time to grok/manipulate. I wish I had access to a more intuitive API to work with APL.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    I really appreciate the Alexa-specific sdk tools Amazon offers in JavaScript, and hope they offer the same soon for Ruby.
