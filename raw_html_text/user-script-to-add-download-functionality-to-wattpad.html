                    Wattpad does not allow the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        highlighting of text in their DOM
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        general copy and paste
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        add download functionality to websites to cater to the user base who would like to keep a copy of the books offline
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Decided to go with user-script since a standalone server using puppeteer or similar headless- browser would be too CPU intensive and a full stack would take too much time for a 24 hours hackathon
                </p>

                            $(document).ready()
                        </code>
                        .
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        variables from
                        <code>
