                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What sparked our idea was the high cost ($60) of purchasing required iClickers for certain classes in school.  These little remote controls are simple, having only a few buttons, to answer quiz questions in a classroom setting.  We knew that we could find a cheaper solution without the out-of-pocket costs for students.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a web app in which teachers can log in to input questions and answers, indicating which answers are correct.  There are buttons for the teacher to start and end the quiz whenever they wish.  Students can also log into the same web portal to answer these quiz questions with a simple but elegant interface.  The results of the quiz will be easily accessible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Apache on Google Cloud Platform to host our website.  We had a folder containing all of our HTML, CSS, and PHP files, all of which were completely coded from scratch.  We used Notepad to type all of the files, and used PhpStorm to debug errors in PHP.  Python was used to help with processing the inputs.  We used GitHub and Git for Windows in order to collaborate and push changes to the files.  We used Domain.com so that the shorter link c-tapp.online would link to our website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into several challenges.  One challenge we ran into was receiving input and reading and writing to/from a file on a website.  Another challenge was hosting the website on the Google Cloud Platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to successfully deploy the website on Google Cloud Platform, learn PHP, successfully manage client server interaction with reading and writing of files to a server, making an aesthetically pleasing website using HTML and CSS, and using Git to keep our project efficient.  We were able to successfully incorporate Python to handle inputs from one page to return an output.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all came in without knowledge of PHP, but after learning from tutorials and using PHP to code the backend of the website, we became a lot more comfortable with the scripting language.  We all learned many new skills such as using CSS to make adjust HTML elements, how to push/pull with Git, and how to host a website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for C-TAPP
                </h2>
                <p>
                    C-Tapp can be converted to a native mobile app so that if students wish, they can open the app very quickly.  More functionalities can be added in the future.
