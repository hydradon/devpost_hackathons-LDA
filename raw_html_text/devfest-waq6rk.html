                    Why we are at Devfest:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because we want to have fun!

                <h2>
                    Why we are creating this app:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make it easier to access and display useful information in a centralized location and allow users to customize the flow of data they see to their personal tastes. An similar existing tool exists for Linux users as Conky, but the the application is not very user friendly and accessible for most computer users and and also not very aesthetic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How did we build it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started out by thinking of what do we want it to look like, and then planned out the classes we need to implement. We had a lot of back and forth on the designs of each class (panels, subpanels, etc.). We use Java Swing to build the GUI of this app. 
You can
                    <code>
                        git clone
                    </code>
                    the repo and compile all the java files in the
                    <code>
                        src/
                    </code>
                    folder, and run
                    <code>
                        java Main
                    </code>
                    to start application. It might look different on different platforms. 
We wanted it to support drag and drop, and customize the layout of different components. But we only got time to do a dropdown menu.

                <h2>
                    Look forward to...
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have this idea of using your own desktop as a cool dashboard of information of your choice. As programmers and developers we can easily add our own functionality just by implementing a new method in the Scripts class. 
Of course, we don't want it to be too energy consuming, which can be a problem yet to be solved.
