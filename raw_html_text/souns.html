Though these devices capture the information that was being said, it fails to comprehend the real mood of the person. We feel it is important to capture the human emotions in their speech to give better services for the end customer.

                        . These datasets had some limitations such as the number of spoken sentences and the number of different speakers. So, we had to build our model based on the existing dataset.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We tried to build our own dataset for emotion recognition, but we were not as good as the actors/actresses from the dataset in expressing our emotions. So, we felt our dataset will add in more noise rather than trying to improve our model accuracy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Streaming audio data and processing the sound data over the web server was difficult because of incorrect byte format that was used during streaming and reading the streamed chunks
