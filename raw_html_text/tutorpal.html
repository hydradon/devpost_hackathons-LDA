                    *This will send an automatic email to the parents about their tutoring time
      *At the end of the tutorial, the teacher can award them points for showing up, their engagement, etc.
      *The teacher can set their own scale if they want, to convert the total points they have, to a certain amount of 
      extra-credit points
      *EX: 10 tutorial points = 1 extra credit point
      *No rewards, only points.
      *Teacher can enter
      *Points can be translated to physical rewards

                    We built this mobile application by using Android Studio.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a super complicated project int he beginning, and it took us a while to tone it down to something accomplishable. However, none of us had ever used Android Studio and have coded in Java! Luckily, our great mentors helped us a lot, and we were able to get an MVP done.
