                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I use a lot of different apps to keep track of things I need to do, but none of them had all the functionality that I wanted. So I decided to fix my own problem by creating a to-do list app that did what I wanted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keeps a list of what you need to do, with items that can be checked off when you're done. There's also a history function  that saves a number of finished tasks, so that you can put them back if you've changed you mind/need to do it again.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Moving Forward
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to add more functionality to the app, such as categories for tasks and a priority management based on dates and the ability to edit tasks.
