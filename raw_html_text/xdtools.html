                    I also used this as an example to all senior partners/managing partner at a large accountancy practice of what can be done and the future of accounting. They have a mixture of clients on old legacy desktop software and xero. It was clear after the meeting that the drive to move more people to xero was not just a trend or MTD related but the actual realisation that utilising xero's API in different ways. It can speed up process, customise the data to help them, create more billable work, highlight problems, increase consistency and add real value to their clients.
