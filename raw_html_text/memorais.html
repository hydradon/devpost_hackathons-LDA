                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I don't like the time it takes to scroll through my hundreds of photographs trying to find something specific. I thought it'd be so much easier to just go and search for specifics within the photo to find it easily.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can enter a specific tag that they're looking for, and if anything from any of their photos are prevalent, there will be another screen with a grid displaying all the qualifying pictures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I made an android application that goes through the user's photos on their device and pulls them into the app. I then used the Clarifai API to help identify the tags in all pictures so that specifics could be searched for. It will then sort through all the common tags based on what was requested, and present the users photos with the appropriate tags.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to pull in all of the users photos without them having to go in and select them all. It was also difficult to sort through the appropriate tags and then present them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is my first time ever working on an application on my own, it was also my first time working with the Clarifai API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use the Clarifai API as well as work with other features within Android development.

                    Finish the application as best as possible, and add new features such as searching through Facebook pictures as well.
