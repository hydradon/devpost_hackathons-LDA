                    Motivation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fonts are crucial in the workflow of typographers and graphic designers to make texts easily legible and aesthetically appealing. However, there are some major challenges to choosing, using, and designing fonts:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        There are
                        <strong>
                            millions of fonts
                        </strong>
                        available online. Even with font filters, it is often time-consuming to pick the font with the essence that the designer wants to achieve.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Many popular fonts pose
                        <strong>
                            license issues
                        </strong>
                        for designers. Often, designers need to spend expensive fees to avoid legal issues.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If no font with desired style and license is found, typographers need to design their own font. The process of crafting a font can be very
                        <strong>
                            time-consuming
                        </strong>
                        .

                    <li>
                        Current image generation techniques focus on
                        <strong>
                            raster images
                        </strong>
                        . Generating vector fonts is a relatively under-explored area.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We aim to provide a toolkit for typographers to get the font

                        can be hard to learn. For example, we tried to learn the serif-ness of a character with StarGAN, but it does not produce comparable results with simple latent space interpolation with VAE.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In addition to providing a toolkit, this project provides a method overview for the task of Font Generation. We have a few observations during the development:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>
                            Start from simple fonts
                        </strong>
                        . We observe that simple fonts such as sans serif are easier to generate and manipulate than highly stylized ones such as handwriting. However, in the typography market, these simple fonts are on the highest demand. Therefore instead of focusing on generating fonts with crazy styles, we can work on producing production-grade simple fonts that improve readability.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>
                            Data is crucial
                        </strong>
                        . A utopian vision is to learn the font manifold and produce open-source industrial-grade fonts to everyone. However, to learn this model, it is always good to get more data, especially for the highly stylized fonts. With more typographers contributing to open-source fonts, we can achieve this goal earlier.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>
                            Vector paths is a visual representation worth looking into
                        </strong>
                        . This is not only important for the task for Font Generation, but for a resolution-independent representation for computer vision in general, such as image segmentation, data annotation, and art creation.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Font Generation
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>
                            A better interface
                        </strong>
                        and clear functionalities. To make the interface friendly to the general public, we need to restructure the UI and list the functionalities more clearly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>
                            Get more data
                        </strong>
                        . Currently, we have the entire dataset of Google Fonts, but we need to get more data with valid licenses.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Investigate the
                        <strong>
                            representation of vector paths
                        </strong>
                        . The existing work uses simple VAE and sequence models to generate characters in a one-pass manner. We have ideas of extending the work to a multi-stage refining process of the paths with a global context, a potential topic that can turn into a research paper.
