                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were tasked with making an application to help alleviate some of the headaches of parking at the UT Tyler campus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Crowder shows you how much space is available in parking lots. Leveraging the power of the Internet of Things, Crowder gathers realtime events
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The server side portion is in php on a local host with the app portion being made react-native and the raspberry pi uses python scripts to talk to send event updates to the server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble setting up a server in node.js so we switched to a php back end.  We've had trouble connecting our 3 main pieces together, from the raspberry pi which represents a sensor on the gates of the parking lot to our server to the app on the phone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We feel like we have a good working proof of concept to show off how our ideas can work in a real world application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learned alot about the capabilities of react-native, php and raspberry pi to work together.  We learned about the issues that can come up with trying to incorporate an api.(We used google maps api).
                </p>
