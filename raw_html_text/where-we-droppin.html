                    Where We Drippin helps you save water by teaching you about the impact of your leaky faucet on the environment and your wallet. It also lets you know how fast your faucet is dripping and extrapolates the data to let you know what the consequences of allowing it to drip for longer are.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An Arduino connected to our custom-built water sensor attached to our model faucet sends a signal over Wi-Fi to a node.js server, which lets you access information about the environmental and economic cost of your faucet at any time.
