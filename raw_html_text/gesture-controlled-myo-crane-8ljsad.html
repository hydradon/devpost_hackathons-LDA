                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Legacy controls for construction requires onsite presence and includes risks and dangers, skilled workers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To help reduce the risk and to ease their work in manipulating the cranes, we used the Myo gestured Armband to actually control a mini scaled crane structure made out of motors and servos.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Myo SDK and its API to use its gesture control to manipulate the Servo and DC motor to operate the crane.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well, to start off, we had a tough time getting started with learning the Myo API functions and integrating the components of Arduino (hardware and software).
                </p>
                <p>
                    _ Frustration Issues _
_ Sleep Deprivation _

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    Not giving up till the end (_ Worked for 23 hours _)
Team coordination despite the grueling technological challenges
Learning/Figuring stuff out/Implementing ideas one after the other
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot about Myo Armband API's, abundant experience with Arduino and servos. 
That building different components is easy but integrating them all together is difficult and needs time
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Gesture-Controlled-Myo-Crane
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Industrial use in real world for manipulating large scale cranes at construction sites or even use the gesture controlled utility to automate and implement augmented strength to automate large scale machines.
