                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We both took physics in high school and felt the experience, especially related to electricity and magnetism, lacks tangible demos which make other forms of physics easy to understand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Physics AR takes the concept of point charges and electric field lines and brings them to the real world. Through the use of augmented reality, a teacher hosts a room, where he or she can create charged particles on flat surfaces like tables or the floor. Students can join the room and view how the particles interact in 3D space.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app was built using Android. The AR library that we used was Google ARCore. The backend that we used was Google Firebase Realtime Database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We never had any experience with AR before, so learning how ARCore works was very challenging. We ran into a lot of issues with hosting the Cloud Anchor API and then resolving the APIs. Once those issues were resolved, everything ran relatively smoothly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We never had any experience with AR before and we managed to build a functioning app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work with Google ARCore and Google Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PhysicsAR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Other concepts in physics like thermodynamics. Maybe add concepts like chemistry or mathematics.
