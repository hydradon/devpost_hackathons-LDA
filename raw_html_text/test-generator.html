                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My teachers had problems making tests so I made a test generator to help my High School's teacher community helping them making tests which generate randomly making them fair and square and also helping them save time significantly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It generates a vocabulary test generator which randomly selects chapters and vocabulary terms that the user wants it to

                <p>
                    By using String Arrays and random methods
