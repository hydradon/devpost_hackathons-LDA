                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have been working on the Blocktricity (blockchain based automated demand management system) for over a year now but we are facing trouble to get the customer to collaborate in order to build it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So we decided to design a platform for the participants to share and manage their data first and then simulate and optimize their assets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It displays the participant and its community data in the the dashboard tab.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It manage assets and contracts in the profile tab.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the interface with React on top of data provided by the spnsors. We simulated a user and its community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge was to set the data for visualization and simulate a user case. We also work on the storage valuation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
