                    We were new hackers looking to create something. Looking at the goals of the companies present, we liked what Viasat was aiming for. So we tried to develop a web app under their goals.

                    It's a local chat that allows two people to communicate through one computer.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We checked out many tutorials, and found this one.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Our original idea was solid but after working through 6-7 tutorials (since we aren't experts in web applications), none of the platforms were right for us.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We made something at a hackathon.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    I learned that I should research projects previous to the hackathon and then learn the tools to use it.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    I'd like to develop chatter into our idea called Pulse. Pulse was a chatroom based on location. You were able to communicate to people within a certain distance of yourself. You could create and join chatrooms that were similar to your interests. Pulse could also be used for alerts, warnings and city based communication.
