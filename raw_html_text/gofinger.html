                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With day-to-day login getting more common, password managers are becoming the next thing we cannot leave without. Very often, we will use a master password to govern all these other passwords. While we are trying to make our lives more secure, the master password becomes our single breaking point. Just imagine your master password getting compromised.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the familiar concept from the latest Macbook pros, the TouchID to log in to our computers have revolutionized the world. We are extending the idea to everyone out there with not just the cold hard cash to pay for the latest, but just a simple mobile phone with a fingerprint sensor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are using the combination of fingerprint sensor on the phone and combining it with a chrome extension as a password manager to allow the seamless integration between the two devices.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The devices we used are hard to integrate and test. Steep learning curve, learning these technologies from ground zero.

                    Hopefully win something and bring this to production.
