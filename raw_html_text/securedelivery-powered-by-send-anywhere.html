                <p>
                    My submission to Send-Anywhere is the proposal that Send-Anywhere enter the Multi-Billion-Dollar industry of digital media and digital product sales such as eBooks, Videos, Music, Paid White-Papers, Photography and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I propose to expand Send-Anywhere into the Multi-Billion-Dollar digital-product industry, with literally millions of businesses who can use Send-Anywhere to securely deliver, and more importantly, protect their electronic products!

                    <strong>
                        A 15 BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The eBook industry is already a 15 Billion Dollar industry. Although there are big players like Amazon, there are many hundreds of thousands of businesses that sell their eBooks and other products on their own websites using Shopify, Magento, WooComerce and PayPal. Today, they have no way to protect the links to their valuable eBooks and products. Many times their products are stolen because the links to their products get spread in the Internet.  Protects against theft of your digital products with expiring and secure delivery links. So SecureDelivery with Send-Anywhere customers cannot post your links to forums or social media for theft.
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    Musicians, artists, photographers, musical bands, software, games and other digital products have no real secure way of distributing their products, and protecting their products. The number of independent musicians is increasing at a massive rate, nearly 500% per year, now numbering in the hundreds of thousands, and more appearing every day. None of them have a secure way to distribute their music, until now.

                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Magazines have a different problem. Advertisers demand to know how many people actually download the digital magazines. If many people use the same link to download a digital magazine, the magazine doesn't get credit for the extra downloads, and can't charge advertisers more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        THE SOLUTION IS WITH SEND-ANYWHERE
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally there is a solution to all these problems with SecureDelivery and Send-Anywhere. Now digital publishers, musicians, photographers and businesses with digital products can protect their products, and securely deliver them to customers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Here's how it works:
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Companies, musicians, bands, publishers integrate Send-Anywhere into their shopping cart. When a customer purchases a digital product, the product is delivered securely via email or mobile to the customer with a one-time secure and private link via Send-Anywhere. SecureDelivery brings Send-Anywhere easy integration into shopping-carts and payment systems, and helps businesses control and inventory their digital products with an easy to use Customer Service Dashboard.
                </p>

                    <strong>
                        SECURE DELIVERY OF PURCHASES
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    It works simply, and securely, completely automatically and unattended. Once a user completes their purchase, they are sent a Purchase Confirmation email with a one-time-use URL. The URL can be used to download the product once. The advantage to businesses is that they can feel comfortable that the product is delivered, and the URL cannot be passed to others, or posted on the Internet. SecureDelivery with Send-Anywhere can manage inventory, manage data streams and provide secure delivery of all kinds of digital products.

                        CUSTOMER SERVICE
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have included a customer service dashboard where a business can track orders, sales, products delivered and even downloads. From this dashboard the business can re-send download links if a user didn't use the link before it expired.
                </p>
                <p>

                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is also technology to stream one-time-view videos. When the user completes their purchase, they are shown the video for a one-time viewing. Once they leave, the page, the video is no longer viewable. This works by releasing from inventory, one view of the video that is routed and streamed through Send-Anywhere connecting the video server to the end-user.

                    The K-Pop phenomenon is growing fast, and they are experts in marketing and promotion. Now they have a tool to promote to more audiences. They can run a promotion where if you "Join our Facebook/Email List/Etc" or "Become A Fan", the fan can download a private, exclusive, never released song! The one-time-use link makes the fan feel special.

                    Each product is considered an independent inventory item. Even MP3s, Videos, Photos, and eBooks. So each product can be stamped with a watermark, or personalization. This allows promotions to be more powerful because they are personalized, and digital publishers can make sure their products aren't shared because of the watermarks, combined with the one-time-use links.

                    To show the versatility of this submission challenge, the eBook and MPs are served from Amazon EC2 Servers such as S3, and the video is served from a separate Microsoft Azure Cloud Server. This shows that the system and files can be hosted anywhere, and the products and files that are being delivered can also be stored anywhere, and are NEVER in any public folders or directories. So people selling products, can be assured, that their products and data is never exposed.
