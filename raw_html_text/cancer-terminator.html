                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even after years of technological advancement and medical innovation, Cancer remains a threat disrupting lives around us. We hope to provide some respite to survivors and ongoing patients through our game which would give them a feeling of empowerment over Cancer.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game involves the player's character to shrink and travel inside the body, hunt down and BLAST away cancerous cells ! Using Virtual Reality, we aim to give the player a truly immersive and almost realistic experience.

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    We have not submitted an actual working game due to our lack of background in Game Development, however, please consider the power point presentation we have included in the submission - we have tried to give a good idea about the layout of the game.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The problem we are trying to resolved was a great challenge in itself, since we wanted to come up with something that can really cater to the emotions of Cancer patients and sympathizers.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    Mentally and emotionally healing Cancer patients is as crucial as physical treatment, so we believe our Game is indeed special in that aspect.
