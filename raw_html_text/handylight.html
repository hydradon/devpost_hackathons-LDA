                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team members are keen on computer vision and deep learning. Helvar&rsquo;s challenge with intelligent light switch has inspired us to build a project at the junction of state of the art computer vision and people's everyday lives.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Life moves too fast, bombarding us with too much information, tempting us with too many distractions from what really matters. That&rsquo;s why it is so essential to make an effort once to make our lives easier forever!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Think of you lying on the bed feeling like falling asleep but you have to get up to turn the lights off. Bruh. Just imagine that you don&rsquo;t have to do it anymore! All you need to do is just point your hand to the light bulb and voila!
                </p>
                <p>
                    People are too lazy to control the lights manually! We want to help them by automating the whole process and giving the user a really frictionless control. 
After all, let&rsquo;s be honest. What can be cooler than a possibility to &ldquo;rule&rdquo; the lighting with an elegant hand movement just like Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore did?

                    The solution
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How wonderful it would be if we could add some magic to our non-magic lives!
                </p>
                <p>
                    What we offer is controling lightning system effortlessly  just with hand pointing up at a light bulb!
For the solution we use camera and artificial intelligence to analyze gestures and REST API to manage the lights.

                    How does it work
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As simple as you can imagine: when a person points to light bulb it just inverts its state - turns on, or turns off accordingly.

                <p>
                    We faced with challenge to match predicted pose with light we want to control, after few experiments we decided to use a line between a shoulder and an arm, computing the length of the shoudler-elbow and shoulder-arm we can understand that a person wants to switch the light on/off.

                <p>
                    As technology achieves great progress in machine learning, the idea of smart homes is starting to materialize. Nowadays there is a lot of amazing project for making our home easy and cozy. Obviously, the light is essential part of every home. That&rsquo;s why our idea is to make light not usual process of turning on/off the lights, but simplified version of it wich works with hand motion.

                    We hope that during the judging  we will get inspiring suggestions or feedback on our project.
