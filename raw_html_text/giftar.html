                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having friends that live all around the country, I wanted a simple way to send them a little something special, whether for a birthday, as a thank you, or just because.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GiftAR allows you to send your friends a virtual gift that they open using Facebook Camera. Login with Facebook, choose a friend, add a message, and away it goes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the app in Xcode using Facebook's SDK for login and AR. The gift animation was designed in Spark AR Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have very little experience with AR in general, let alone using a custom AR scene. A recently rehauled Xcode and Swift release also presented some challenges, with mechanics changed or code being depreciated and having to learn the new implementation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud I was able to get a working demo at all, halfway through it seemed like I would not finish in time. But a few epiphanies and lots of caffeine, I was able to push through. I'm also proud of being able to take a new concept and not only learn how it works but also apply it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about the Facebook SDK, especially their AR kit, accessing certain features of iOS, like the photo picker, and app design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GiftAR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to see it grow by adding a variety of AR gifts to choose from, as well as enable a way to send virtual gift cards in the gift. Having the custom message write itself out in style instead of just appearing statically and adding a photo of the user's choice to pop out of or display on the giftbox are also great features I would like to implement.
                </p>
