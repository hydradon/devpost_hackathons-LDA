                    Catherine Bradley: Growing up in coastal Texas, I have seen first-hand the effects of delayed responses to natural disasters such as hurricanes.  Quickly implementing a solution to draw power inwards from the coast is an important aspect to modern disaster relief.

                    What It Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Buoyed Solar Islands, roughly 6000 square meters in area, provide power via Submarine Power Cables to cities located near the shoreline.  These Islands are located ~1 mile from the shoreline, and the Submarine Power Cables are delivered via autonomous UUV to the sands.  As power is slowly restored, cables may be flown by a small sUAS fleet to inland cities.  This fleet of sUAS will also be utilized to create a TPLink mesh LTE network in densely populated areas.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After creating the concept, we sketched out the basic plan for implementation.  I revised each technology in order to create an efficient system that will quickly deliver basic energy and a self-sustained network to a remote location while infrastructure is repaired.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding accurate power output data for large-scale solar panel implementation was difficult.  There is no one easy solution for providing power to devastated areas, but I believe short-term implementation of solar panels is an incredibly effective means that does not require the use of valuable fresh-water resources.  This is only viable in the short term, lest we risk disrupting the environment near-shore.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I worked through many setbacks while creating the concept for the Buoyed Solar Islands and WiFi mesh network.  There are many issues with attempting to implement sea-based solar panels that can be overcome for a short term duration.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We truly have a lot of land space for solar panels in the United States!  In finding modern problems with installing solar panels to any remote area affected by natural disaster, I found that we have the capability to provide a significant amount of power to our own country before a disaster strikes.

                    What's next for 2-Phase Emergency Relief
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would love to fully flesh out the Buoyed Solar Island design.  I believe there are near-shore solutions that could be viable in the long term for seaside cities.
