                <p>
                    You're a spy for the US government and your job is to stay close enough to the target in order to retrieve critical information. You periodically receive information about the target's location; however, the target has a means to detect if you're getting closer to him/her. Find the target before time runs out!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Gameplay
                    </strong>
                    The spy's objective is to reach to within a 10 metre radius of the target (the danger zone), and remain there for 5 seconds. As the target, your phone is continuously sending a live-stream to the server. You also have 3 warning lights indicating when the spy is 30, 20, and 15 metres away respectively. When the spy is within the danger zone, your lights start flashing and you have 5 seconds to escape.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the spy, you receive a screenshot from the target's live-stream every 10 seconds. You use this information to hunt the target down and stay within the danger zone for 5 seconds - if you don't accomplish this in 5 minutes, you lose.
                </p>
