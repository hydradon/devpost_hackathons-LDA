                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our game creates a VR and AR multiplayer experience, recreating the classic spy and informant relationship. One VR player explores through the map, stealthily maneuvering the given level, while the AR player gets an overview of the map, including seeing enemies and being able to control elements in the world. Together, they must cooperate to efficiently and safely navigate the given level.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity. AR was made through Vuforia, while VR was done SteamVR. The two modes are connected via Unity Networking, using specialized rendering to give the different material views of the same world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the last minute, we could not compile to mobile because an issue with one of the shaders we were using which caused the app to require a 2 hour build time (We only had 2 minutes). We ran into issues with multiplayer networking, synchronizing the two players, as well as a bug in UNet which caused the wrong game objects to receive networking rpc calls. We also ran into AI issues. AI is hard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AR and VR connect with minimal delays. A phone is able to host the game for the AR and VR players.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will be bought out by a parent company producing Event Horizon (Event Horizon is a multiplayer VR/AR multiplayer space ship combat RTS developed by us as well).
