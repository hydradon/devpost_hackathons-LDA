                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Existing tour guides are tour guide finder tools don&rsquo;t give tourists exactly what they want. Tours are usually expensive and only hit the tourist attractions. Manufactured, large-scale, commercial tour packages may include attractions that the tourist doesn&rsquo;t want to see. If a tourist wants a specific, authentic tour, locals from the area who really know the area can serve as their tour guides at a much more affordable price. A small, personalized experience can benefit a tourists&rsquo; experience.

                    Wander is web application that uses a variation of the concepts of Uber and Tinder to match local tour guides with tourists.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a raw, demo version of the website with p5js, HTML, CSS, and Adobe Illustrator.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was all of our first times developing a web app from scratch, so we ran into some trouble while learning how to do certain things with p5js, HTML, CSS, and Adobe Illustrator.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a working demo web app that showed what our actual app would look like.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create a simple web app from scratch and how to problem-solve and look things up to make progress with our project despite obstacles.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Wander
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The current Wander front-end model web app serves to show what that actual app would look like. The next step would be to implement the back-end with the ability to store and pull information from a database using Python. It would also be ideal for Wander to develop into a mobile app for quick and easy access to tour guides.
