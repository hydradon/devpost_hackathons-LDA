                    Students struggle to balance getting enough sleep, remembering to eat, and studying. A chrome extension that keeps track of essential stats, such as eating, sleeping, and studying habits, which then reminds you to be a functioning human being. The extension has a timer built into it which quits out of the current tab once the timer is over. This is done to ensure that users can control their screen time and live a more well-rounded life.
