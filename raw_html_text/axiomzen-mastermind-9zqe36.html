                    Make it start receive messages from Slack and answer them.

                <h2>
                    If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Stick to the good old Python 2.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    If you could change something about this challenge, what would it be?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'd change nothing from the challenge itself. But it would be good to have a warning in the API docs telling that we have 30 minutes to solve a game. Discovered this when after lunch I tried to keep guessing an open game and started receiving strange warnings on the terminal.
