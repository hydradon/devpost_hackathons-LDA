                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> This bot was inspired by the "personal healthcare companion" from Big Hero 6. We designed this as a quick help/advice. We were inspired to build the therapy portion of this bot after we met some people who were dealing with depression issues or just needed to find their personality.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> The health bot functions as a sort of hotline; you rate your pain on a scale of 1 to 10 and it provides instructions to care for your injury. If your pain is mental, the health bot sends you to the therapy bot named Master Therapist. The therapy bot starts a conversation after a simple "hello." After the initial start, type your true feelings and the bot will help understand the problem in a different light.
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> We built this program with Gupshup, which runs in javascript.
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> Initially, we ran into the problem of the bot not recognizing keywords or giving the wrong information at the wrong time. In the end, we were able to fix the issues by reading about them on w3schools.com and by reviewing our past work in javascript.
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> We have learned how to use Gupshup and created a bot that can be activated whenever a Twitter account was direct messaged. We are proud of the fact that we connected a bot to a social media account and plan to continue learning to create chatbots in the future.
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>  We learned what Gupshup was! Before the hackathon, no one in the group ever heard of Gupshup.
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Health Bot
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> For the health bot, we plan to make it more interactive and personalized. We want to make this more of a yes/no elimination based help. Later, we could make a smarter Master Therapist by increasing its keyword vocabulary.
