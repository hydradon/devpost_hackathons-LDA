                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The whole project started off as an interesting application of new augmented reality technology applied in a new and interesting way. While it isn't necessarily the best replacement for existing solutions, it pushes the boundary of what is possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app uses new augmented reality technology to track the user and other objects in 3D space. Then vibrational signaling and accessibility-based voice communication are used to relay information about the world around the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app uses Google's AR Core on a Google Pixel. From there I was able to add accessibility, vibrational and other features to enhance the app. It also integrates with Android's screen reader.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with new beta technology was tough, but it gave me a chance to apply what I'm learning in school to the real world. It doesn't look like much, but for its intended audience it didn't matter much.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a noticable difference when walking around between different colors. In a way, even when your eyes are closed, I have been able to feel different colors in an experience I can share with anyone in the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project is my first Android app that actually compiled. Learning to make an accessible app was eye opening.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EyeSight
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Face recognition and motion tracking. With these features, you can find someone in a crowd and hold a conversation easily.
