                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SAMHSA (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration) had a compelling presentation at the start of the hackathon. Ilko and I ditched our original idea and started thinking about tech solutions for people suffering from substance abuse and mental health issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Health Centers web app gets the user's location when the window loads and then populates a google maps image with nearby hospitals and health centers. The user can then select one of the locations that they want to go to. Once they select a nearby health center, a button appears offering to call an Uber to take them to their selected location. Clicking this button opens the Uber app with the route and name of the destination already selected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the web app using html5, css, and javascript. I used the google maps API, and the button API for functionality. I used materialize css to help with styling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into challenges incorporating the google maps and button API's.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of making a clean and simple web app that works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use the google maps and button API's as well as how to use materialize css. I improved my javascript skills and became more confident working with objects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Health Centers
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is some functionality that should be added. For example, the phone numbers and addresses of the nearby health centers should be easily accessible within the web app. Additionally,
                    <strong>
                        the button API only works on mobile devices, and therefore users cannot order an Uber when running the app in a desktop browser
                    </strong>
                    .
