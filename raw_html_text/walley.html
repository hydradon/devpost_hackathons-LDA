                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before coming to Canada, I needed a reliable, free and easy-to-use expense manager, but I couldn't find any. Free functions on many of them were really limited, many of them had terrible UI. Enter Walley - easy-to-use budget manager.

                <p>
                    Unlike other competitors, you jump straight in to action -&gt; no need to add an account! All the data is saved locally and can be synchronized across devices: just log in to your account and that's it!

                        These functions are intended to come in the next update:

                    Logging and registration are done using Firebase. All the data is saved using Firebase too. 
Synchronization with server is done whenever the app is launched or closed.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    _ lack of time and me feeling destroyed at the end of it all _
                </p>
                <p>
                    Saving data locally: efficiency and reliability were my main challenges. No offline database could offer me speed and reliability at the same time. SQLite was an option right before I realized it is not suitable for long-time operation. So, after rewriting 300 lines of code, I came up with my own solution.

                <p>
                    That I finally made this project, and that I found the way to actually make it work. Besides, it has a great design and feel.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot, mainly how to develop on Android XD. But, seriously, many things like writing/reading to/from the file, animations, pie charts creation, using graph libraries and so on are crucial to my overall experience.
