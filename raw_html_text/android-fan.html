                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to make the Lego android move because I thought it would be cool
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You use the joystick to turn the android's head towards a flower that is spinning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used an ardunio to program the joystick. Then I found the maximum range for the x and y inputs in order to find the maximum distance. With that I made a ratio with 180 to find the degree the android's head should turn to. After that I made the DC motors turn according to the x coordinate of the joystick.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For a while I couldn't get the motors to work but the program was returning the checks that I put into the main code as well as reasonable values.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of getting it all to work at the same time, half of the night was spent trying to figure out why parts that did work didn't work anymore.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to print to the Serial port and how to set a different ardunio type to be uploaded to. I also got a lot of practice debugging with hardware and software. Finally, I practiced being resourceful and making my own parts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Android Fan
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would get more powerful motors so that I can make the android move the way I originally planned!
