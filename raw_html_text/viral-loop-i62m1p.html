                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you post something public on Facebook Page, you can only know how many fans like, comment, or share on their posts. But, the statistics can't help you to exactly find out the process of dissemination.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After we post the post, we can track down all the fan groups that share this post, and then know that each style of post will have different repercussions in different pages, using the tree diagram to see at a glance.In which fan group share the most posts, and then the fan's group is classified, it is clear that the fan group attracts fans and finds out the potential customers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, let's assume that we can fetch a list of posts by Facebook's API .
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>/v3.0/{page-id}/posts
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Find out that who will share the original post and how many shares.
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>/v3.0/{post-id}?fields=shares
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Then classify all the shared fan groups.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally saw the shared API in the Facebook for Developers Graph API Explorer, but when we actually did, we found that it was not open, so we hope to have a shared api in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we can use this technology to let the company know which fan group each of his articles is attractive to, and to classify all the articles with shared articles, so that we can more easily know the positioning of the audience and find More potential customers can also know where the article broke out and find people from unknown people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the existing facebook system, we can only know from the insight report how many people share, how many people like praise, how many people leave a message, but we don't know what kind of people are interacting with our posts, amd these posts can be shared again by the people who share it.
So we can get more detailed information from the Viral Loop. We will know the path of sharing and the number of times of sharing through the tree diagram. Then we can use the shared people to do interest classification. You can know your own post through the classification.about what kind of people are attracted , or some different audiences through the classification.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for viral loop
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope that facebook can open the shared API, so that we can get more information and make the whole data more complete and more valuable.
