                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Too many people are too trusting of the hardware around them, freely logging in to important accounts on public computers. We assume that anti viruses will protect us, but what if it's not the computer it's self that's bugged, but the keyboard? This goes undetected by the computer, and if it's easy enough for 4 novices to implement, then it should be concern.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Klog is essentially a dual keyboard in one. It has 2 keyboard chip sets and membranes inside, allowing it to store keystrokes on the keyboard, and also send the keystrokes to the computer, never allowing the operating system/anti virus software to become aware of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We took the guts of a keyboard and forced them into another, along with a raspberry pi 0. Each keystroke get's logged via a c script on the raspberry (keyboard1), and also sent to the computer it's plugged in to (keyboard2).
Paired with it is analyzing software that scrapes the data and searches for possible username/password/website matches, including social security numbers, bank information, etc.
A code is typed into the keyboard that sends the data to the malicious users computer, where the software is to analyze it.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're not very hardware-savvy, so figuring out the logistics of double wiring the keyboard and fitting it all in the chassis was tough.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to elegantly combine a lengthy tool chain, from low level c and shell network, to high level GUI and string parsing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our python, java, c, shell, and overall hardware skills were seriously buffed. We also learned good communication and team planning, because we could not have done this with out that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Klog
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We don't plan on making these, since they're rather malicious. The idea was more of for awareness of an issue that most people ignore.
