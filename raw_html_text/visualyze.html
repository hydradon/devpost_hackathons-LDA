                    We were inspired by Spotify's API and its features to recommend new songs based on the user's musical preferences. This got us thinking, what about the visual aspect of music? What about the album covers? Cover art may be seen as just a marketing strategy, but it is way more than that. It is a way for artists to visually portray their musical messages to new and old audiences. Recently, BTS, a Korean boy band, was nominated at the Grammy's for their album cover and fans all over the world cheered them on. Having a Korean boy group at an American music awards show was historical, and it truly shows the impact visual art can have on music.

                    A simple idea like this quickly snowballed into a real prototype. We aimed to create a web app that would recommend users' music based on the album art of their musical preferences. Using Python, we were soon experimenting with the Google Cloud Vision API for color and object recognition in album covers. We also utilized Last FM's API to link to users' Spotify accounts and retrieve the album art for recently played songs. Halfway through Saturday, we encountered an error with importing the Google API libraries into the Google App Engine that we were going to use for the web app. This was our biggest obstacle and we spent until midnight troubleshooting this issue. Unfortunately, we were unable to directly solve the error and decided to pivot using other resources. We switched to the Django framework and scrapped the App Engine while still being able to use the Google Cloud Vision API. Although it took a while to set up and get accustomed to, the new project worked and we were able to successfully implement Google Vision in our application.

                    This was our first hackathon and learned a whole lot more than expected. For some of us, it was the first time building a web application from scratch and it was our first time using the Google Cloud Vision API.
