                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make campus safety and responsibility fun and easy. Having walked home countless times late at night through unsafe-feeling areas around our campus, we wanted to create something that empower students to stay safe and provide peace of mind when going out with friends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the wearable device market booming, and some surveys even putting personal safety wearables above fitness trackers and smart watches as consumers' number one desired wearable device, we figured it was time to bring personal safety devices to college campuses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LitBit is a wearable safety package that also interacts with others. By creating the ultimate wearable for college students, we aim to break out into a new market - reminding the world how people can look out for each other while also having fun. Checking in with your friends gives you comfort about knowing that your friend is safe, also, gives an opportunity to interact with them through our technology.
The main purpose being the safety of the individual, LitBit can tell your GPS location to 911 (or campus police) and your emergency contacts if you punch a quick combo. LitBit could also in the near future help you care about your loved ones safety, with the "WalkMeHome" feature. User can activate this feature when they get sketched out at night but sending an easy notification to their selected friend and basically make them walk you home by watching your every step on the map in the LitBit app.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As the main processor board, the team used the Particle Photon, used Piezo sound alarms, vibration motors and capacitive touch sensors. Currently, LitBit has a sleek design, 3D printed from Carbon fiber and Onyx, however, only the basic functionality is running. User can call 911 and send their location to them.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally set out to use a Bluetooth board that would pair with your phone and handle most of the processing in the mobile app. However, after working on the iOS app and bluetooth board for more than 15 hours, team decided to pivot to using Particle Photon because of technical difficulties.
hole electrical design. Whenever we thought that every was done, some wires came unsoldered, or broke. Our battery charger broke halfway thought the competition however, we came up with a solution with the generic batteries on hand by tailoring them to our application.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Markforged printed enclosure came out great. Especially for a prototype and only having access to clunky electrical components, it was a pretty decent looking design.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to cope with problems, some might just come and go, some might be very frustrating. Seeing the bigger picture in that gave all of us motivation to continue and finish our project. 
We learned a lot about how to recover from unexpected roadblocks. When

                    What's next for LitBit
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to continue pursuing this project and turn LitBit into the ultimate wearable for college life. We wanted to develop all of our existing ideas to LitBit then improve it by coming up with unique concepts and functionality to maintain our position in the market.
