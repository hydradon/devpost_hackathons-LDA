                    Inspiration: Wanted to create a better tool to find the ideal hiking location, with the ability to see important information at a glance, and get additional details if needed to plan the trip in an easy to read format.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What it does: JHYR automatically shows a list of all recognized hiking locations in the lower mainland - providing you important information at a glance, and the ability to narrow down a set of trails, or an individual trail with Search or Filters
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into: Getting independent components to work together; git broke.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Accomplishments we're proud of: Being able to create a fully functional back-end and front-end with a beautiful design to create an incredibly simple yet powerful tool to find the best way to engage with nature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What we learned: Programming languages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What's next for JHYR: Adding more powerful filtering systems to create a faster and more powerful user experience. May add additional functionality for users to engage with specific trails or their specific collection of trails.
