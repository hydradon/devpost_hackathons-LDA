                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of us have been developing games on Unreal Engine and thought it would be cool and really helpful for certain areas to have the power of machine learning accessible in Unreal Engine. Not only is it useful for games but it has significance to the many companies that use Unreal Engine for real life simulations,

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It utilizes machine learning algorithms and exposes them to Blueprint for extremely easy use. Data collection can also be completely automated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Unreal Engine Plugin System, C++, and Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    C++ Machine Learning Libraries were a pain to compile and install on Windows. Lots of the syntax was also new and we had to find creative ways of getting things to work with Unreal Engine.
