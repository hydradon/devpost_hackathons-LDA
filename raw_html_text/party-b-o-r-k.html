                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tinkering with new technology led to the idea to use what I had learned to make a party dog.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses touch input to pick one of four patterns and color schemes for the light up head to display

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After tinkering with the assorted electronics I grabbed I eventually learned how to hook them all up and program them in python. All that was left was to design a fun case and application for it.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    3D printed shell became not feasible, lack of team attendance, unfamiliarity with language and hardware. Personal power supply output not ideal for original portable idea.
                </p>
