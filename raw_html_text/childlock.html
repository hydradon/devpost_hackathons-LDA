                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were playing with the Smartcar API and wanted a way to keep track of where the car was and to control when it was allowed to be driven.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If it worked: User would be able to set geo-fenced 'zones' that are associated with times. A car can only be driven during those times and in the defined zones. If it leaves the zone or is unlocked outside of specified time, a twilio phone call is sent out to alert the parent/guardian.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python on the backend makes API calls to the Smartcar API and returns response to React frontend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the API call to cooperate was a task. Also, it took a long time to figure out how to send info to the python server and what data structure to use for responses.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If there was more time, I would get a working version with zones.
