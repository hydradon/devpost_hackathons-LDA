                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the work of woojay poynter who designed a two-axis stabilization system for a spoon and posted his ideas on Instructables.com. We decided it would be fun to design a toothbrush on similar principles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This design is a toothbrush with two servo motors. One servo responds to the x-axis of an accelerometer to maintain the position of the brush head regardless of x-axis orientation of the toothbrush handle. The other servo controls the brushing motion and is activated upon the press of a button.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this design by programming an Arduino Uno to take input from an ADXL3xx accelerometer as well as a Button Module from the 37 Sensor Kit v2 by ELEGOO. The output was to two servo motors. We found some code samples of both aspects of the design (the brush head and the balancing servo) that we combined to integrate into the toothbrush assembly. We started by implementing each of the motors separately with their own programs, and once we had everything completely debugged separately, we combined the two.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While we were debugging, the entire assembly stopped working altogether for no apparent reason. We tried a new Arduino, new servos, new breadboard, and finally determined that it was one single faulty wire. This was very frustrating! We also were challenged by the accelerometer. It is an old module that probably doesn't work as well as it should or could.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of having a functioning prototype. This was a really fun project that challenged both team members' skills in different ways. We are excited to have implemented two servos as well as a button.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One team member learned much more about coding in Arduino. Both team members learned more about the value of iteration and persistence.
                </p>

                    What's next for TeethEasy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Better accelerometers and more than 1-axis of balancing!
