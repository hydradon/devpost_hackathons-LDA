                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever forgotten where you parked your car? Ever left your keys in your car? Our Android app solves these problems and more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Smartcar API, our app can seamlessly connect to your car and let you lock/unlock it, or view its latitude and longitude using the integrated Google Maps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using the Smartcar API. Our backend is a Python server that we run on serveo.net. Our frontend was coded in Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we ran into was setting up our app to communicate with the server. The documentation for the Smartcar API had the server running on the local machine rather than a remote server.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up the app to communicate with the server. Integrating Google Maps into the app.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Where to begin. First of all, for most of us this was one our first times integrated an API into a project from top to bottom. This was also the first Android app for most of our team, so we got to learn about Android Studio, version control, etc.
                </p>

                    What's next for Bumblebee
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integration with Google Voice such that the car can unlock and lock with voice. Improving the overall UX/UI. Increase the efficiency of the app and server.
