                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We, the programmers of Mapstar, were visiting a good friend in Aachen. On the way to his home we wanted to explore the city simultaneously. But we were shocked, when we had to experience that Google Maps is missing the feature to create
                    <em>
                        interesting
                    </em>
                    routes. Therefore, we came up with the idea for Mapstar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Imagine using Google Maps. However, instead of showing you the shortest way to your destination it shows you a way that is interesting and fun for you. You can choose from different topics that your are interested in like Historical Landmarks or food. Furthermore, you have to decide how much time and money you are willing to spend your trip. With these parameters we create a List of possible Locations based on Yelp data you might be interested in. Afterwards, you have to choose which of these you want to visit on your way. At last, we create the best possible route for you. You  can open this route in Google Maps so you can enjoy your loved features of their app.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our IDE was Android Studio. The data we use is fetched from Google Maps and Yelp.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were quite new to Mobile Development and ran into some Problems with Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing the core Features in time + not giving up + Finishing my first real App(Lennart).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Developing for Android and using APIs like Yelp and Google Maps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mapstar
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will rework the UI and improve the Algorithm for selecting places from Yelp. Moreover we will add more user input possibilities to enhance thee user experience. For example we want to add a shuffle feature, which will work similar to Google's "feeling lucky".
