                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We saw our Massey Debate website, and wanted to start our journey through web development by creating a new Massey Debate site based without any template to be a 100% learning experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It shows people interested around Essex County (Windsor, ON) what debating in Massey's club is all about. It also informs members about previous topics, and information for applications and competition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a combination of HTML and CSS to build our website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inexperienced with HTML and CSS, so everything from basic syntax to good flexibility for all display sizes was a challenge to us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made the website quite aesthetically pleasing, and it is something that we can look at and appreciate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to best use objects in situations, and that for different occasions a template for a website is a lot better to use for bringing more useful features to the website besides providing text to the reader.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dabaou-iiazaar.github.io:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make a server that will access a database to hold all user accounts to provide more information for club members, such as their next opponents or even virtual debates.
