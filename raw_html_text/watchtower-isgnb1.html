                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by growing demand for financial tools as more and more retail traders poured into the market.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Watchtower compacts a large amount of technical and fundamental indicators into a small web platform. Currently, users can view historical prices for a stock, filed information of the company they invested in, and a variety of technical indicators they can view alongside their stocks.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Watchtower with a Django backend to require data from Aladdin.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the largest obstacles was formatting the data to be readable by the graphing library.
