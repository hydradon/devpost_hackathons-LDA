                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I use anaconda regularly for my cs classes.  when I saw that it was one of the open source projects I could contribute to, I immediately jumped on it. My mentor was an employee of the company. Super chill guy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an amazing great package management system, takes care of all the dependencies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As this was my first time contributing to an open source, my mentor walked me through most of the processes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was figuring out which part of the code was causing the bug. My mentor suggested the git debug and I used it to overcome and fix the bug.

                    Understood git debugging. Made a PR.

                    What's next for me
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have used open source before but never contributed to one. The feeling is pretty great so, i might start contributing more regularly.
