                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were frustrated in how much tedious manual work needed to be done in educational tools and wanted to find solutions that will help automate repetitive tasks to give teachers more time to spend on teaching their students. We were inspired by Code Nation's problem with transporting students' grades from Google Classroom to their Salesforce database and wanted to automate away the hours of unnecessary effort teachers had to endure whenever they wanted to transfer information over.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ClassUp accesses a teacher's classrooms through Google authentication and exports their students' grades and information with just a click of a button.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to build the foundations of ClassUp using node.js and simple HTML and CSS. This ensures that we do not over-engineer our product and reduces the chances of confusing the people who are in most need of this tool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While building our product, we ran into quite a few roadblocks. In the beginning, we had issues creating our node server and conflicting files in our GitHub repositories. With the help of our mentor and a bit of troubleshooting, we were able to overcome these obstacles and keep moving.
However, we ran into more problems with authenticating our logins with Google sign-in, which stumped us for quite a while. Luckily, we found a solution through lots of testing and documentation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to have tackled new technologies and went outside of our comfort zone to work on a common goal. Despite only knowing Java, we decided to used Javascript, HTML, and CSS to make our project, which was scary at first, but we all learned something new.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because of this project, our knowledge of online authentication, node.js, and csv files were widened. Before ClassUp, we only had knowledge of Java programming. We decided to tackle something completely new and we are proud to have increased our breadth in a variety of skills that may be useful to us in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ClassUp
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As of this moment, we are unsure of what will happen to ClassUp after this hackathon, but we hope our efforts will have saved educators time that would be better spent on teaching the youth of our world.
