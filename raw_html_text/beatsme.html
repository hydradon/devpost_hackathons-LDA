                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recent Advances in Convolutional Neural Networks to generate Speech and existing work from multiple groups
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on a seed generates a set of beats that can be later put into a MIDI file
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used Tensor Flow and Magenta to train a convolutional NN with a few hundred electronic drum beats
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Didn't have a UI so I have to use a template, it was hard to find a use case
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A successful training of the network and the conversion to MIDI files
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Machine Learning is tough
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BeatsMe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I already enrolled a couple of producers and artist willing to test it in real life scenarios.
