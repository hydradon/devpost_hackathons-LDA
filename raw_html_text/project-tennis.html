                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As tennis lovers, we wanted to see what it takes to create a truly 3D experience, integrating real-time feedback and interaction between the audience and players.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can play one-one-one or in multiplayer games of tennis. The audience is able to interact with Alexa, who acts as a personal scorekeeper, judge, and commentator for the game. Using accelerometer data from an Android app and  a Myo attached to a Tennis racket, we were able detect accurate movement and make this experience as immersive and accurate as can be.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Unity and AWS Lambda for Alexa, and "Azure-base".
                </p>

                    What's next for Project Tennis
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Incorporating a real-time website where users can see who is playing from which parts of the world as well as any players who are currently waiting for a partner (and who people can join). 
We want to make this as immersive a gaming experience as possible, and that extends to the experience before and after the actual VR match.
