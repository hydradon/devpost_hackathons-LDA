                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenged at BostonHacks to create a fintech hack, our team wanted to create a visualization tool that (1) answers a financial question and (2) is easy for the general public to understand trends and interact with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team built a web tool that displays side-by-side comparison of investment returns between index fund returns versus actively-managed funds. On the left, user can view the index fund and on the right, the user can add stocks to the actively-managed fund side. With the new stock addition, the user can watch the active-managed fund returns dynamically change.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We had difficulty deploying the application with RedHat OpenShift, but RedHat advisors were there to help and we have it successfully running!

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
