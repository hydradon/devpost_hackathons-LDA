                    In America, the culture of Chinese cuisine has been grossly oversimplified to fortune cookies and orange chicken take-out -- both of which, we regret to inform you, are foreign inventions. The myriad of dishes that evolved from the ingenuity of grandmas, grandpas, mums, and dads during thrice-a-day household meal preparations eventually became what we know today as Chinese cuisine - with each province proudly crowning a signature dish out of the many it is known for. Today we present to you a glimpse of this diversity, one that extends far beyond the fortune cookies and orange chicken, with the help of ArcGIS.
