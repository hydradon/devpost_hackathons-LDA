                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Help people keep track of their calorie consumption without much hassle.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes picture photo of your food and tells you how much calorie is present in that dish. Based on total calorie consumed by you in a day, BMR and how much time you have for workout suggest different exercise.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Google vision API to fetch data name of a dish. Then we used fatsecret API to fetch calorie content for that dish. Used Workout manager API to suggest exercises.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding the API for the data we needed and which was not private was hard. Needed to improvise on the idea of the project.
                </p>
