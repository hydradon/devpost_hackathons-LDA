                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started off having the idea of how people could progressively integrate technology into their lives, and with all the smart electronic device and household appliances, we want to further integrate technology into the textile industry. Our team is particularly interested in computer vision and image processing so we want to create a jacket (cuz it is winter coming) that can be applied to security and healthcare.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Recent reports from PoliceOne.com says that it is vital to integrate these body-worn cameras into their duty to increase efficiency and effectiveness, so we are planning to build these cameras into officers' and police-dogs' jackets for early detection of targeted individuals from police records databases, especially during civil unrest.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Our device would provide a platform for the visually-impaired to get real-time information of objects, signs, and other people in front of them. This program can be connected to smart blind glasses with headphones to benefit the disabled population.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Raspberry Pi camera as a reasonably-sized device to fit in the jacket, then we implemented openCV to capture real-time data with its built-in object recognition functions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, two out of three people in our team are better with software so we needed to spend some time getting used to the hardware tools. Then comes the software problem, we initially started off with openCV and we tried different tutorials to install it into the Raspberry Pi. That took us a huge amount of time and we did not get the code to compile.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then we were thinking of implementing Google Vision API instead and spend quite a while to realize that the API does not take in video inputs but static images. Therefore, we decided to go back to OpenCV, tried out using pre-compiled binary openCV, but we ran into some error. Finally, we realized that we need to resize our OS's partition to have enough space on our SD card to run OpenCV.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team got to explore the potential applications of several hardware tools, learned some cool problem-solving skills, especially when we stepped through how to get OpenCV installed. We also finally came up with an idea that can benefit public goods in terms of security and health safety.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Konnex Jacket
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next steps are we need to find a portable battery to use as a power source for our cameras. We are also trying to put in some fluorescent reflecting paint as a safety feature. To serve as a police public safety device, we need to connect the camera with the police records database, and to serve as a health assistance tool, we need to filter the information reported to the user.
