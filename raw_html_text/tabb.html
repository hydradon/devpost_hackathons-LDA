                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every day, people are constantly running into the problem of not knowing to whom they owe money, and who owes them money. Tabb is designed to solve this fundamental problem by creating a platform where all monetary transactions and tabs are transparent.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tabb allows users to create groups or join groups for specific projects or events. As the group spends money, the receipt information is uploaded. Tabb takes the amount of money spent by each person and provides a real time image of the current financial situation of each member of the group.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Tabb group has never used firebase before, and ran into some troubles getting ideas coded.
                </p>
                <h2>

                    <li>
                        E-Payment options - Allowing tabs to be paid via Interac e-Transfers, Paypal or credit card.
