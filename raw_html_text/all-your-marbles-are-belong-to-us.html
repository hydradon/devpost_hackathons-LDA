                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rocket League, Tetris, and any other game that challenges your dexterity and reflexes.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    You control the Marble of Destiny, the most beautiful Marble living in MarbleTown, but a new Marble threatens to be more beautiful than you! You must consume all the Marbles as fast as possible to maintain your status as "Fairest of them All!"

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Unity, C#, and an obnoxious will to never quit.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had a piece of code that wouldn't allow me to randomly generate the marbles and it took the help of Nick from MLH to point out that I was missing two f***** brackets in the code. Major shout out to him and all the tidbits of knowledge he spread around! Muy helpfull!

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game isn't that great and it really isn't that much to look at, but I am ridiculously proud of it. Not only because it is the first game I have ever written in my life, but it is also the first time I have ever coded unassisted as well. I keep replaying the game, completely astonished that I wrote this own my own!!!

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coding isn't as scary as I thought it was. Yes it is hard, but the end result is OH SO REWARDING! I learned that I love to code! I've always been in the school of thought that I would never and could never be a coder, but this hackathon has changed my mentality and I am so stoked to write more games!!!!
