                    The app was originally submitted into a startup project. Although it didn't make it past a few rounds of screening, our team decided it would be a good idea to see where we could take the idea by modifying some components of the app and trying to bring it to life.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Pastimes connects users through mutual interests and hobbies. As a social app, it helps bring people of similar ages and locations together. Additionally, it allows users to pick up, learn, and explore hobbies that they would have had to pay money for without the app. The app comes built in with its own currency - HobbyCoins, which allow users to trade or "sell" their hobbies or time. Users are always rewarded for participating and sharing with others, and are free to use their earned HobbyCoins on whatever interests they feel like pursuing next.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    During the hackathon, Pastimes was built with a combined team of 6 people: 2 worked on (a separate team) on Blockchain so that it could eventually be implemented within the app and 4 worked on the user interface and design. Prior to the hackathon, the idea of Pastimes was developed by a group of four college students from New Jersey/Chicago, one of which brought the idea to the hackathon.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    It was difficult for us to get to know Swift as we were coding the app. Since we were unfamiliar with many aspects of Swift, we struggled to carry out some of the features we envisioned for the app.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We are proud to have learned and explored Swift and Xcode. We are also proud of our basic app design and idea development for the app, in general.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We learned that web applications and mobile applications require lots of time and devotion. We will spend time programming the app after the hackathon.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We plan to further develop the app, successfully implement Blockchain, and program all of the necessary features and actions.
