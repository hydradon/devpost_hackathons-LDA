                    Inspiration - The inspiration for this project was the the relativity it had to all of us. We have all known someone who had been, at some point, bedridden in a hospital and we know that it is a horrible feeling when there comes a point where you have no company and you are there by yourself. So we created an app to change the lonliness when your loved ones have left the room.

                    What it does do - This app helps patients in need and boosts their happiness by always giving them the connection they need while they have no one else to talk to. We built this for the Morgan Stanley challenge, and we implemented the Twilio API as well.
