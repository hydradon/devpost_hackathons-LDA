                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hate taking notes by hand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Take notes by keyboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wrote a Python program that deciphers USB HID tables from a standard USB keyboard and logs all of the input to a file on the device. The Noteboard doesn't have a display, so it relies on an external interface to access your notes. Because the Onion Omega2 hosts its own AP as well as connecting to a normal WiFi network, you can view these notes from a cloud-based web app (in development) by connecting to the device's AP or by connecting the device to an internet-connected AP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    USB HID pages are pretty difficult to find documentation on. Also, the Omega2 only has 10mb of available userspace storage, so it was hard to find tools that would fit within that limitation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It totally works except for the cloud-based web app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How much of a pain USB HID pages are to decipher.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Noteboard
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A cloud-based web app to access and manage your notes. Also a battery pack. Also embedding it all into a keyboard rather than having dangly wires everywhere.
