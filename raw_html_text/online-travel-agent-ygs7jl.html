                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We love to travel. But having ourselves manage all our traveling needs on different services is a lot of work. Traveling is still considered a luxury for many. We believe that travel costs can be estimated down to tens of dollars for digital-enough countries.
All we need is a visual planner that can help us plan better and estimate our costs to the tenth.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a service where all a user has to input is destination and time (optionally this can also be intelligently suggested).
Once it knows when and where you want to go, it visualizes and plans the trip for you: the flights (by getting quotes from Skyscanner), the Airbnb (by narrowing down the AirBnBs that are closer to your destinations, with a minimum preferred rating and a nice enough review), the Uber (books what you like to ride), your events (pulls up the type of events you'll like), the dinner reservation.
Once booked: it'll show a complete map of a user's whole travel itinerary (and the path) using a map service, and show a very close estimate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And the best part: it does it all for you!
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        It pulls out your tickets automatically when you need them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Books your Uber when you land at the airport.

                <p>
                    Express.js with Node.js is used to develop and serve the backend logic. It developed and uses Google's Direction API, Google Places API, Google Place Autocomplete API. The frontend is developed in React.js. has used the public web address and google cloud services was used for hosting the website.
