                    , we arrived here without a concrete idea but more as curious minds. Dan and Tamas, from Cloudinary, decided to help us and to put us on a project based on their platform.

                    What it does

                <p>
                    The idea was to create a generator of sound based on an image (e.g: meow for a cat image). After some brainstorming and a lot of different ideas, we decided to create a more music-oriented project,
                    <strong>
                        Imacoustic
                    </strong>
                    . It would generate a music based on an artist's picture, and could also create a shuffle playlist with similar songs/artists.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We shared tasks between front-end &amp; back-end. A team first built a simple layout with HTML/CSS while the other one was focusing on javascript/jquery.

                    <li>
                        Communication: overwhelmed by the lack of preparation beforehand, we had a problem of communication between the team. We realised it is quite complicated to share such a short-time project between 7 people.

                        The idea: we did not have any concrete idea before the Hackathon, unlike most of the other competitors.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Music industry: some of us are very interested in the music industry, nonetheless we are not experts, nor musicians and this probably put us in a more complicated position.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Delimitate our project: ideas streamed in from every direction and it took us time to be realistic about our project's feasibility.

                    We finally managed to design something and to make things work (generator) with still a lot of imperfections.
