                <p>
                    According to a study by Gallaudet University, anywhere from 37 to 140 out of every 1,000 people in the United States have some kind of hearing loss with 9-22 of those being functionally deaf. However, very few schools provide the resources to learn ASL. Therefore, we believed there needed to be a way to make learning ALS easier and so we made it.

                <p>
                    Given a word or sentence, QuickASL returns a sequence of gifs that show the user how to sign what they want to communicate. It does this by taking the inputted words or phrases and then scraping through the handspeak website for the sign that corresponds to each word and then presents them on our site.
