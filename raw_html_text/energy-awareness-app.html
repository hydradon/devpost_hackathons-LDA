                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm new to hackathons. My partners have done web development at previous hackathons and wanted to try doing something new, so we tried out React Native.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You start out with a budget of $_____ and choose appliances you want for your dream home by swiping right or left on cards that you're interested or not interested in.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the starting code for a simple Tinder style app and modified it and added new functionality for our purposes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a hard time figuring out what we wanted to work on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a new framework (React Native) and new facts about energy consumption that we didn't know before. It was a big challenge, but we learned a lot!
