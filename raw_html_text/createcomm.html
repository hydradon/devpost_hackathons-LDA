                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team members is passionate about art, and we realized it is very difficult for artists to find commissioners and also difficult for people to find artists to commission.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a social media like platform on which people can look up artists, message them, and commission them. All users have a profile, either Artist or Commissioner and can use this profile to request or accept commissions. Commissioners can submit a request form to be matched up with artists who fit the style that they prefer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with a basic template, and made our own pages, links, forms, and personalizations. Using Cloud9, we were able to all work on sections of the code at once, each person doing about 1.5-2 pages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally, we wanted to build an app using xcode, but the program was hard to understand, so we decided to create a website that did the same function. Cloud9 also had some issues with saving and deleting other people's work, but eventually we got everything done with a lot of saving.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of how our website looks very put together, even though the functions are not yet complete. The website was sometimes glitchy and had several misalignments whenever we made edits, but we were able to debug and fix these issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were all at varying levels of html knowledge, some of us starting out with none at all. We each furthered our knowledge of the subject to a higher level with more complicated interfaces using CSS. Some of us had only done very basic html websites, but now understands the flow of the code a lot more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CREATEComm
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope that one day we will be able to make the website into an app because it may be more user friendly in this manner, and allow for us to actually publish it.
