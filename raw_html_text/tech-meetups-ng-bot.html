                <p>
                    Two things:
                    <strong>
                        single source of truth
                    </strong>
                    for tech meetups and helping
                    <strong>
                        tech meetups get better
                    </strong>
                    by getting feedback from attendees.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a regular techie, keeping up with tech events you would want to attend in Lagos, Nigeria isn't very easy. There is a lot of meetups, a lot of noise, a lot going on. Fortunately, this seem to be the case in most major cities in the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the other hand, organizers of tech meetups find it
                    <strong>
                        very difficult to get feedback
                    </strong>
                    from people who attend their meetups.
                    <strong>
                        Less than 10%
                    </strong>
                    of surveys sent out are filled.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TechMeetupsNG isn't just a messenger bot. It's a system. We first started a twitter handle to gauge how much people loved the idea. Next followed a facebook page. And then the bot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The bot is built with node and express at it's backend, ejs as templating engine and React as client. To keep meetups dynamically maintained, we built a ruby on rails api with an admin interface to manage/update records.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most of the design decisions on the messenger bot are tailored to what people've told us they want.
                </p>

                        We tackled the problems from a people-first, not an app-first perspective. Building users even before we had a product was amazing.

                    <li>
                        Our team is made up of just one dev. The other members of the team have proven how important it is to have a diverse team.
