                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was so much cool hardware to hack with, that we wanted to try all of it! This project combines the Oculus, Roomba, and Kinect into what we think is a really fun experience. Also Google DeepDream is wild.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use an Xbox One controller to drive around a Roomba. A Kinect is strapped to the Roomba and streams point clouds to DeepDream. The Kinect point cloud is passed through several iterations of DeepDream, leading to a psychedelic effect, before being sent to your Oculus VR.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most robot interconnectivity is handled by ROS (Roomba, Oculus, Kinect). DeepDream runs on our CUDA-enabled laptop.

                    Challenges we ran into
