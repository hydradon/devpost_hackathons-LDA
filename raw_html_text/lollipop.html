                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by a TED Talk given by Drew Dudley about everyday leadership. One point that Dudley makes is the idea of a lollipop moment. A lollipop moment is when "someone says or does something you feel fundamentally made your life better." This made us reflect on our own perspective of these moments allowing us to appreciate them more. We want to promote and spread happiness and gratitude about even the little things.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app encourages you to be more grateful and give thanks to the small things that happen to your life. It continues to remind you the small happy moments that you may forget. We allow users write down their personal moments with the option to share it with the world. The users can see the posts from other people nearby to see the good things going on around them. Users can choose to receive a notification every morning to start their morning with a happy thought and one at night to remind them to reflect on the day.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to build the app in Java. There is a SQLite database to store the data from the users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Team members had a lack of experience in android development. So building this app was a learning experience for everyone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to build a minimal viable product that fulfills all the objective that we set out to accomplish.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about android development process and being able to set realistic goals given a time constraint. We also learned how to ideate quickly to develop a project that all the team members can be proud of. Along the way we also learned to appreciate the lollipop moments during HackNYU.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Lollipop
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The future of Lollipop would include moving the database to the cloud so that everyone can interact with the app and with each other. We also plan on improving the user interface to enhance the way that users interact with the app as well as aesthetics.
