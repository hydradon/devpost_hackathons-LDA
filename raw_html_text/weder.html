                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started out by asking ourselves, What does 6 inches of snow mean to any of us? We realized that most of the users can't related to these numbers that are displayed on all the apps. Also, most of the users always had questions like 'Can i go out and play today?' or 'What should i wear today?'  or 'My app shows me there is going to be fog this morning, when should i start from home to reach my destination on time?'
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Weder has four cool features. One, it has a digital assistant you can talk to and ask questions about weather. Two, weder is connected to your Facebook account and you can see the weather in your friends' region. Three, there is a style option that helps you plan your attire along with any accessories like umbrella that you might need that day. Four, weder has a fun play option based on augmented reality that makes it snow or rain in your room based on the weather outside

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the bluemix's insights for weather and apache spark for intelligent decisions

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into some design challenges while designing the style option.
