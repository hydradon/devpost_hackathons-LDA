                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We never have time to eat properly~ we wanted to create a customizable cookbook to help us fix this issue.

                    What it does

                <p>
                    It greets you when you open the app. You are presented with options, currently the working option has a recipe.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) We created a working program in Java: containing multiple classes with all the features we wanted to implement
2) We then slowly started transferring over to Android Studio
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're all in our first year of CompSci and this is our very first Hackathon!
We didn't know how to use Github, weren't very familiar with Android Studio, and we're all just learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We struggled with learning how to work with a repository - but we're thankful we could learn all about it!
We also learned a LOT about Android studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're so proud that we were able to create. Period. We came to learn, learn, learn, and we did!
                </p>

                    We'd love to continue this project so that we can see it complete fruition.
