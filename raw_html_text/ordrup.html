                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On the first night our team came together, we went to have dinner at a restaurant nearby. As we came in, we were told that their network wouldn't be able to handle processing 6 bills in a short-time period. Only 2 people could pay.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This added stress to our dinner, since we were all thinking about how much it would cost the 2 people paying (even though we were going to pay them back). We decided that our project should be about relieving stress for the customers and aiding businesses in getting over technological hurdles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created an application that keeps track of individual guest's orders and allows servers to update and manage their tables. It also allows customers to choose their preferred method of payment and any point between verifying their order and leaving. All this without the bottle-neck of a debit machine or a busy server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Customers use NFC to tap their phones on a beacon at the restaurant table. Their server can then update their order through the app for the customer to view and verify. At any point after verification, the user can pay through either mobile payment and leave, or prompt the server that a card machine or cash payment is required.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used NativeScript for the frontend, NodeJS and mongoDb for the backend. We leveraged the use of cloud computing by using AWS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were two developers on the team so integrating the frontend and backend took a while. Learning and integrating some of the libraries from scratch to make our app was a mammoth task that took a lot of time and effort.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was one of the most admired and unique project in the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for OrdrUp
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Potentially integrating Rogers IoT services to create a mesh IoT network while at the same time extra features can be added to the app such as 'paying for someone else'.
