                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If anyone uses Notion.so, they know it's great - you can add pretty much any type of block you want - creating your own personal dashboard, or an all-in-one space for their team. However, their Google Maps integrations are limited. Currently, you can embed a map that's centred around one place, but not much else. As someone who enjoys planning their trips (such as this one to Boston), I wanted to see more ways Google Maps can be used in the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    These new integrations allow you to get directions and put them into a Notion page without navigating away. The feature would pull the place names entered within the block with a /map command and provide directions as well as the map associated with it to the page. Another feature is the ability to embed maps from your Google account's My Maps. By authenticating with the email address you have with Notion, it can pull your saved locations into the Notion Page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is only a prototype/proof of concept as Notion does not provide an API to let you develop for it (which is understandable due to the maturity of the product), but if I were to build it, I would use the Google Maps directions API, as well as the Google Cloud Platform authentication permissions to connect Google Maps with Notion.
                </p>

                    What's next for /map Google Maps Integrations
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If Notion provides the ability for users to develop integrations into their current app, this would be a key one to tackle. It would also be very smart for Notion to do this since there has been SO many feature requests as their user base grows.
