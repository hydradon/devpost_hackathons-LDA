                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recently, with the rise of new social and political turmoil there has been an explosion of protest, be it the rise of new ones, or the reawakening of old. With so many new protests being occurring, it is difficult to keep track of them all. Often protests will take place, without many unaware that the event even took place. The app, March On!, will help more people find protests near them and keep on top of all the new occasions.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First we laid out our ideas on Google Doc, in order to figure out what the app would include, after that on the google slide we created a framework for the app and fleshed out what it would appear like to a first- time user.  Our final step for the creation was to use Xcode to fully design an official working app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We encountered a bug while creating the UI of the app on Xcode.
When we ran the app on the simulator, it didn&rsquo;t show the expected display. We tried everything, searching on Google, recreating the UI, and searching some more. Did I mention that we searched on Google?
We tried everything...except looking at the runtime warning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Xcode and link buttons to screens
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to not only work hard but to persevere as well. When we had a bug, we learned that we cannot just get frustrated and give up.
We learned how to create a UI and linking buttons to pages in Xcode.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for March On!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully with the use of our app, more
 people will be able to become involved 
with more protests and hopefully a wider
 audience will be able to contribute  a voice 
to social and political problems.
