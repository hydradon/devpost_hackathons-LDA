                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Confusion about the new Block Schedule and where I (or others) will be going every day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Upon installation, the program asks the user for the school they attend and their scheduled classes. Then, the app will analyze the district provided calendar to sort the schedule for each particular letter day in the device&rsquo;s calendar app. This allows quick access to knowing what letter day it is and what class to go to next, as it sends a push notification at the end of each block as to what class is next. It also takes into account partial days and delayed openings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Shortcuts app is relatively new, so much of it is still unrefined. As a result, the program may not function correctly in Daylight Standard Time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning new uses and applications of certain functions in the app in a short time.
Making a program that could benefit nearly 10,000 people across the district.
