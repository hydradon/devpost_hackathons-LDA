                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Over hot pot, we found a dataset on Kaggle that predicted no shows at doctor's appointments. From subsequent research, we discovered that 20-30% of patients miss their appointments, contributing to clinical inefficiency. We wanted to expand this, and build a tool that helps solve this problem. We implemented an algorithm we found in a paper, and integrated it into a website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Schedules appointments in an optimized fashion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wrote the website with Flask and Bootstrap. The backend was created using Python, and a basic scikit-learn linear regression was used.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning new technologies, finding a project that was doable under the time constraint and had enough data.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Modifying and implementing the algorithm. Scalable framework. Finally figured out forms on Flask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Don't reinvent the wheel if it still works.

                <p>
                    Google Calendar integration? Improved UI and error handling. Improving ML model with more data.
