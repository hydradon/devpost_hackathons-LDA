                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To gain experience with making a maze game in python and breath-first search implementation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game automatically creates a grid and places the
                    <em>
                        player
                    </em>
                    and exit point in a random location. The
                    <em>
                        designer
                    </em>
                    clicks on different locations inside the screen, creating or destroying walls. The program constantly checks that the player has a viable route to the exit. The designer cannot completely block the player. It does so by using Breadth First Search, which is a simple path-finding algorithm.

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    We used pygame as the game environment
We yelled at Keven, it got him to work.
