                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We noticed that mental health is addressed in the media all the time. On the other hand, we realized that mental health-related issues haven't been reduced especially for youth and adolescents. This discrepancy guided us to look for ways to better address mental health.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use image recognition to accurately assess and understand a students' mental health by creating a digital student profile.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, we started by testing Microsoft's face API. After we got AI to identify emotions accurately, we built the back end using Amazon web services and Django. Then we started using user interactions to design front end. After we a clean, user-friendly platform, we started working on merging the backend and frontend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges was merging frontend user interaction with and storing data received by Microsoft's face API. This is because we had to extract various different information settings from the AI as it only gave a generic template for the images presented. Another big challenge figuring out how to incorporate the video with the face API since face API only uses image recognition to detect emotions but not videos.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our solution and we truly believe it's a solution to current market opportunities. 
We are also proud of learning how to use Microsofts' cognitive services and use various AI features to extract and process information. In addition, we are proud of the UI which we spent a lot of time to research so all user interactions feel friendly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Microsofts cognitive services and additional knowledge in the backend by going to workshops. We also learned how to discuss and come to a consensus with differing opinions among group members of different academic background.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Moody
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More features such as better algorithms for measuring student's mental health, faster response times as the site can be somewhat slow due to all the requests, and we're looking for new ways to approach mental health among teenagers using cutting-edge technology of today.
