                    Moments is an app that collects memories. It not only takes pictures, but collects and stores metadata such as location, battery percentage, currently playing song, and more. This makes going through old pictures more interesting and immersive. Moments was our first time building an iOS app, and although we didn't meet all of our goals for it, we learned a lot and are thankful for the experience.
