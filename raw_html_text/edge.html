                <p>
                    After the pitching process, we brainstormed ideas building off of the many problems present in the healthcare space. As the theme was affordability, this grounded our ideation until we settled on an idea everyone involved was passionate about solving. Once decided, the build process consisted of identifying a concrete problem statement followed by constructing a user persona to better understand our target market. Afterwards, we broke apart to focus on our respective areas of expertise. The rest of the event was focused on getting our individual pieces accomplished, asking the group whenever we needed advice, guidance, or just to bounce ideas off of. Towards the end, the focus shifted towards creating a story flow to center our presentation and demonstration about.
