                    Safe4Me helps communities disrupt crime.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our app helps make communities safer and the police&rsquo;s job easier. It alerts the police if crimes are happening nearby. It contains information such as who is committing the crime, where is the crime being committed, and when. Safe4Me is a new innovative way of keeping communities safe, and lowering the crime rate.

                <p>
                    The way our app works is, it firsts asks for your email, and then has you fill out information relating to the crime such who committed the the crime. Then it will ask you the &ldquo;where&rdquo; and &ldquo;when&rdquo; of the crime. In order to classify the incident, it would ask you about what crime is being done such as a robbery, or a child abduction. It will then ask you about information about the crime you&rsquo;ve selected. After you&rsquo;ve filled out the necessary information, the app will ask you whether you would want this crime to be seen publicly by anyone, or be private and only seen by the police. With the information given by the people who use this app, the police immediately get new reports, and statistics which help the police know which crimes occur the most, and where.

                    We also include a map on our site identifying which crimes occur in which area, so citizens can keep themselves safe, and know that their neighbors are fighting back against crime.
