                <p>
                    We are Cervelio, an international and skillful team from Canada, US, Italy and Finland, here to challenge the concept of what a bus stop can be. Our team is developed as a result of winning European Innovation Academy in July 2016 with a startup idea (Cervelio). Ever since, we have worked together to overcome numerous challenges. We were recently joined by an additional team member for the sake of Junction 2016. We are passionate about finding new and creative ways to make human and technology interaction more natural. We have challenged Emotion AI, Bio Sensing, and now AR.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We are creating an interactive, comfortable and entertaining space within the familiar environment of a bus stop. We are bringing convenience, timeliness and relevance to the user experience at the bus stop. Our plan to utilize HoloLens technology in implementation of our vision.
