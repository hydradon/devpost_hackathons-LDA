                    As a veteran or any person who has been in tough situations, we can struggle with mental health problems such as PTSD, depression and anxiety. While there is the hospital we can go to, we can't always go out of our way to speak with a counselor or trouble a friend. If we had an app at home or even one on a mobile device that can offer myself and other individuals with similar struggles options to help alleviate their symptoms, it would significantly improve each person's day to day life.

                <h2>
                    Calm Me
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This asks the individuals their moods and based on their responses, it will narrow down specific and accurate moods and by that offer the best course of action by recommending meditation exercises, breathing exercises, small mini games and more just by your answers. CalmMe is also understanding in the sense that it will give you multiple chances to answer each prompt and allow you to participate in each activity more than once. Our website would allow individuals to input their closest family and friends contact info so in case of an emergency, CalmMe can send an alert to their contacts and help can arrive.

                <p>
                    Using Node.js 6.10, referencing multiple gitHubs, YouTube tutorials, and my peers, I was able to create a large binary search tree that enabled the answers to become more and more specific in hope to narrow down an appropriate relief for the individual. The website was developed using JavaScript, Firebase and Bootstrap. Allowing for users to put customized information about their condition and emergency contacts to be stored on the website would allow the creation of a network of trusted people that can be contacted in case of emergency for support. The website also provides useful websites and resources for those afflicted by depression, anxiety, PTSD and other related disorders which would make managing them easier.

                    Learning to program in Node.js was a huge difficulty, I could hardly find an answer for specific things and if I found some answers I couldn't get everything to mesh. I also had issues with using mp3 files since Amazon updated the way they needed to be implemented, It is possible but the time frame didn't allow for the files to be added. We also had issues connecting the website to CalmMe which prevented out "alert your contacts" feature to be implemented which would have allowed users to send an alert to their contacts that they are severely depressed and need help.

                <p>
                    I learned how difficult node.js was and how hard working from both websites developer.amazon and console.aws.amazon was since both had to agree with each other. our website also had issues with firebase in terms of synchronizing the database, establishing a functioning authentication/registration system and implementing bootstrap for a functional layout.

                <p>
                    I learned how to make an amazon Alexa app and the importance of agreeing variables on both sites.

                    What's next for CalmMe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to implement the mp3 features and also add mini games, music and more for each response. We also want to ensure the website can speak to the skill and contacts can be alerted. There is also a watch that allows skills to be accessed any where and we'd like to see this app go mobile so people can utilize its skills and features no matter where they are. Google's Firebase services are scalable to mobile versions which we would work on next, since having a pocket version of this service with you everywhere you go would make things easier for those in need.

                    What was challenging for the web application:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting firebase and setting up authentication and a database in which to store the data. Setting up a responsive bootstrap layout that is user-friendly and intuitive took some time and trying to get some features to work got us to dead ends at times.
