                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unsure. Thought of it earlier in the week and then decided to buy the dance mat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wrote a development environment that lets you program using Hy with a Dance Mat. I also implemented running shell commands and using BF in a different script.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've also implemented a basic web UI, but not quite at the stage I wanted it to be.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built using standard python with the the library
                    <code>
                        inputs
                    </code>
                    being used to read the dance mat and Hy as the programming environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting the dance mat working was fairly easy as it was treated like a standard game controller by Linux laptop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Web UI was built using Pure Javascript, talking over websockets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mostly challenge free, but due to rapidly changing the project my code got pretty unmaintainable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Needed more time to work on the Web frontend.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
