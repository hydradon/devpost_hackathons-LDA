                    Quickdown is a fast lightweight cross-platform markdown viewer, for now. It was my project for Hack the North 2017. It's written in Rust and uses Webrender for efficient GPU rendering of large text documents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was originally intended to be something much more ambitious, but I had to scale down my ambitions due to time constraints. See the "Background" section.

                        (theoretically). In theory all the code should just work on Linux and Windows, but it's possible it requires a little fixing. I don't actually have any other machines to test with.

                        Relatively low memory. It takes 200mb to display my largest document, 100mb of which is just the uncompressed images. Chrome takes 400mb to display that document on Github. This readme takes 50mb, most of which is high-dpi framebuffers.

                    I measure the loading speed by starting the program and hitting
                    <code>
                        ESC
                    </code>
                    to quit in time so that the document just briefly flashes on screen before quitting. This gives an upper bound on startup time:

                    Limitations
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Seeing as this was done at a hackathon with very limited time, there's a number of limitations:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Links show up in color but can't be clicked, because I didn't write an interaction framework.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Only supports monospace fonts. I didn't have time to integrate Harfbuzz or kerning and without that non-monospace fonts look crappy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Doesn't support all Markdown constructs. Only the most popular ones.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Command line interface is unfriendly and will crash if you do things like reference images which don't exist.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Background
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was originally intended to be a prototype of a fast document browser
that rendered with webrender and fetched documents using an efficient compressed
network protocol that required one round trip to fetch a page. Hence the name of the crates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This would allow aggressive prefetching and fast rendering, hopefully hitting
the target of displaying the next page the frame after you clicked a link.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, this was overly ambitious, as I realized an hour or two into
the hackathon. So I scaled back my ambitions to just making a fast markdown viewer.
So that's what this is for now.
