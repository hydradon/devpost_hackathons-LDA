                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A teammate threw the idea out and we went with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works like other libraries such as jquery. It can be used to decompress files. It side loads javascript. It currently can be used to check network download speeds. It is suppose to compress files as well, but am having issues with getting this part to run properly at the moment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built using javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Waiting to test until the end. Errors that were unclear. Getting the compression to run properly without timing out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting most of the library to work before the window closed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Writing compression files is not an easy task. Testing small sections at a time as you go is much better than writing the entire thing and then testing.
