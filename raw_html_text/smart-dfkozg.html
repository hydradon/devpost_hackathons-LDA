                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspiration is the "Noise" art project: Confronting the viewer with "Verwaltungssprache", the bureaucratic flavor of the German language used by institutions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It generates "Verwaltungssprache"-Letters: Letters in the specific style that German bureaucratic institutions use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In python, using markov chains and RNNs. We also added Alexa and a REST service.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was cleaning the data scraped from images of such letters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our code actually outputs sentences that while somewhat nonsensical do fit our goal of producing Verwaltungssprache and eliciting the emotions associated with that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That the real prize is the friends we made along the way :).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for smART
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ideally using the results from our project in an actual art installation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately we can&rsquo;t publish the repo and the dataset due to the PII contained within.
