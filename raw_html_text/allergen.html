                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our teammates, Alex, is highly allergic to many foods, but she often doesn't know to which ingredient in particular. However, if there were a way to cross-reference the ingredients in a group of foods, it would be a lot simpler to figure out which ingredient is causing the reaction. Another teammate, Aafia, suffers from chronic migraines. One trigger is MSG, which is present in many foods. It would be fantastic if there was a way to find out whether something is safe to eat without having to scrutinize an extensive ingredient list.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AllerGen allows you to create a profile with a list of things you are allergic to. You can then scan foods, and it will show the ingredient list and determine whether or not you are allergic to it. You can also create a list of foods and then find the common ingredients to see which ingredient is causing the allergic reaction.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a Python backend which searches and queries the USDA's database of UPCs, foods, and ingredients. We then compare ingredients in various foods to the allergen list or to each other to construct the appropriate response. The frontend is made in React Native, which allows us to use it on iPhone and Android.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Figuring out how React Native works, getting different APIs to work together.

                    Getting the scanner to work, and having everything working together (mostly) seamlessly.
