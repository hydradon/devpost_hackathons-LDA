                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Chomecast broke and we don't want to pay for a new one. Attempt to design a chromecast alternative which only uses devices most people will already have on hand, a laptop and phones.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You input a youtube video url on the website, which you can access form your phone or another computer, and then it plays it on the computer running "computerCode.py"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used Flask to create a website hosted through google cloud platform. Fill in details on what videos to watch on the website and the computer plays Youtube videos you link to it. Can also skip videos with a skip button.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initial plan was to have the computer host the website and connect locally but ran into issues with connecting to other devices on the wifi so moved to the hosted solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before this project no one on our team had any experience with web development and we managed to create and deploy a simple website while also accomplishing our original goals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned a lot about developing a website and how to interact with Youtube.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Open Cast Py
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Continued development. Improve the functionality of the video queue, let you remove videos form queue and see whats in the queue. A party mode with voting for when multiple people are interacting with the site. Some way to have multiple computers using the service at once with different queues for each. Possible support for using a raspberry pi. Development is probably going to be continued because we want to use it.

                    Note on use
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not all mobile links work. All Youtube desktop links should work
