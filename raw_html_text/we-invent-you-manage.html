                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After a few informal meetings with employees at freeman, it became obvious that there were no efficient and economical solutions to manage inventory effectively especially during peak demand times. To help overcome these problems to make processes better while ensuring a strict cost constraints stood out for us as a problem worth pursuing.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Automatically update inventory records using QR scans and assist in identifying and preventing misplaced consignments at inventory management firms.
Conceptual Overview:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whenever new inventory is brought into a warehouse, we would scan the free/cheap QR codes provided by the manufacturer as well as RFID tags for considerably critical products. This activity would populate a database with records which would automatically assign appropriate bins for thoses objects. Each bin is assigned a RFID sensor and the staff which updates stock to the bins are assisted by the AR wearable device like HoloLens to warn the user whether or not if the object is being misplaced or approves if it is the valid location. This would resolve the human error in these processes and save precious human time and money.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Received a big blow as we didn`t manage to get hold of critical equipment like hololens or google glass. So we had to modify the original idea and adapt to what was available. Also had trouble getting raspberry pi to work because of a broken image we got hold of.
