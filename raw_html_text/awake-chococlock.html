                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As future engineers, our class schedules start as early as 8:30 AM in the morning. Often times, we accidentally sleep through our alarms because of "oversnoozing" or sleeping in after the alarm rings. As a result, we end up missing lectures and important memos from our professors, which impedes our ability to learn and achieve our maximum academic potential. Awake can help students like us maximize our productivity and ability to learn to make the most out of their days!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Awake is a specialized alarm clock that forces the user to physically leave their bed to turn off their blaring alarm. Simply use the wired-button interface to set your desired wake-up time and the device's speaker will ring at that time. Alternatively, you can use our mobile app. The only way to turn off the alarm is to be directly in front of it. In other words, the user must be awake and standing in front of the alarm in order to shut it off. Additionally, even when the user's phone is turned off, the alarm will ring at the given time. Since your phone can be turned off while you sleep, it prevents health issues related to handheld devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this device using an Arduino, a NodeMCU, an RGB-LCD screen and Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We actually tried to build this with the Telus board first, but we had numerous issues including
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            an old board that was not compatible with the cloud server of our choice
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            issues connecting to the LTE network
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    As a result, we decided to use an Arduino. Some challenges we ran into included issues with HTTP requests, Wifi connectivity, and timing of the alarm. Specifically, we had issues with connectivity timeouts while sending and receiving signals between the NodeMCU and the app. Additionally, we had a limited number of pins to work with and one breadboard. As a result, we had to share resources and work together as a team in order to build one fully functioning device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of a number of accomplishments during this Makeathon. We connected the mobile app to control the Arduino which took lots of troubleshooting with HTTP requests and Wifi connectivity. Additionally, we are proud of the set up of our Arduino as we were able to fit all the components (speaker, NodeMCU, RGB-LCD screen, wires, etc.) on the board while also keeping the functionality of our product. Moreover, our selection of practical sensors are feasible for real-life production as they are extremely affordable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are a number of things that we learned during this event. Although it was efficient to work alone in the beginning, it took teamwork and collaboration to piece the puzzle together. Moreover, constant communication is key when developers are working together. It is essential that we plan out how to integrate our components together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Awake
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to time restrictions, Awake still has many new features that have yet to be implemented. With more time, it can become a multi-functional tool in our daily lives. For instance, connecting an LED matrix to the Arduino would be serve as a great visual alarm. Furthermore, a better UI can be implemented to make the product more family friendly. Overall, we believe Awake has great potential and a future where it can grow and become a widely used application.
