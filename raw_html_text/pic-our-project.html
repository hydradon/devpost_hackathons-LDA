                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Data should be more than just electricity and numbers.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One can take an mp3, mp4, excel spreadsheet of Netflix shows to watch, an album of digital photos and run it through this program, and have all the data stored on a piece of paper. You can store your entire ITunes collection of music in a single binder of paper.
Our project convert bytes of data into an array of graphical representations of information. It uses geometry and simple math to change data into the graphics, and back again to its original form. This allows a poster to store a song or a person to download a movie in a minute from a projector.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed the separate systems to read and interpolate an image of the graphical representation, generate the graphics based on raw binary data, and reconstruct a file from the graphic storage.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Designing a way to effectively compress the data into a visual form was the biggest obstacle, as it was the core concept of the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gained exposure to applying mathematical and creative solutions to a problem, while trying to keep the concept practical.
                </p>

                    What's next for Pic our project
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd like to develop the idea to accommodate multiple uses such as mass public use and consistent functionality.
