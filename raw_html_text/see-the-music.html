                    Why?
                </h1>
                <p>
                    I spend tons and tons of time listening to music&mdash;over 1k hours last year total. Sometimes I'll cherry pick songs that I want to listen to, not putting them in a playlist for safekeeping.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Previously, when I've wanted to retrieve a list of songs that I listened to previously, I haven't been able to. It's even worse when I want to share that list with friends.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    What?
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Introducing
                    <a href="https://seethemusic.herokuapp.com" rel="nofollow">
                        See the Music
                    </a>
                    . See the Music is a website that allows Spotify users to see a visualization of the last 50 songs they've listened to &amp; save it as a playlist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each visualization is created based on the latest data from your profile &amp; is perma-linked, so you can share it with your friends and it won't be replaced with your future listening.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    How?
                </h1>
                <p>
                    This was my first major project built with NextJS &amp; React, both of which are technologies that I've only previously used on a surface level in the past. There were some tough bugs that I ran into through (buttons stopped working, what gets server vs. client rendered, etc..) but I managed to get it done
                </p>
                <h1>
                    The future
                </h1>
                <p>
                    I really want to add in a space for some general stats about your recent music. Spotify tracks some really cool stuff like dancability, key, etc..
