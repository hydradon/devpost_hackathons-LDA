                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I feel in love with Virtual Reality at my first hackathon two years ago.  Then, when I discovered A-Frames and WebVR this past December, I knew I wanted to build a VR website for the Hackathon.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    UC VR is a virtual reality supported version of the University of Cincinnati's homepage.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it primarily using
                    <a href="https://aframe.io/" rel="nofollow">
                        Mozilla A-Frames
                    </a>
                    .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I actually only had a little over 3 hours to do this project.  This was because my previous project, Burrito Ordering Burrito fell through. Also, my headset would not allow me to show my own VR content, so I had to trick it into thinking it wasn't in a headset.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is only my second time making a webpage with a-frames and I'm impressed with how well it came out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about readability in VR, optimal distances of images and other objects, and equirectangular images which are required for the spherical background of the site.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for UC VR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to learn JavaScript in order to make the website interactive and to be able to link to other (possibly VR) webpages.
