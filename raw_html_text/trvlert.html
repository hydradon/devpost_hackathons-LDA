                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by our own sleep deprivation to design a tool to aid students, professionals, and anyone else to catch up on sleep on their commute to the future - without missing their stop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The tool prompts the user to enter their start and end destinations before their route starts and then alerts the user through an alarm to wake up the user about 1-stop before their destination to ensure that the user has ample time to wake up and get off the transport.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Xcode and Swift we built the app page by page incorporating some information from the Marta website and google maps to allow for an accurate functionality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout the development process, we struggled to finalize how we wanted to structure the large amounts of data coming from all the different public transportation systems of various major cities.
                </p>

                    What's next for trvlert
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are looking forward to many things with trvlert:
*Integrating a live view map with user's current location and destination.
*Creating user accounts to save their preferences and favorite rides for access on any device.
*Creating an alarm based off a hybrid time and location logic.
*Connecting the application to all major public transportation lines and types.
