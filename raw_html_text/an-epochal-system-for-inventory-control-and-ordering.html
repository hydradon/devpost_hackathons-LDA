                    Nowadays there are some serious problems we now face, such as food shortages, environmental problems and so on.
We think we can solve these problems with
                    <strong>
                        Logistics
                    </strong>
                    and so we have decided to make a service which will renew the image of Logistics being not so efficient or transparent.

                <p>
                    Our service automatically orders as many goods as necessary to make inventory control easier. Our
                    <strong>
                        AI
                    </strong>
                    detects the images taken by the
                    <strong>
                        IoT
                    </strong>
                    camera called Raspberry Pi. In Ordering, it uses
                    <strong>
                        smart contracts
                    </strong>
                    so that it secures the trustworthiness of the transaction.
This time the object is apples, but this service can be applied to anything.

                <p>
                    Our system monitors and memorizes the inventory (apples for this time) by using Raspberry Pi. When the inventory drops below the necessary numbers, Raspberry Pi calls Python and executes Geth through Node.js. When the process is done, a notice will be sent to our cellphone.

                <p>
                    The system did not work when it connected to other systems although the individual one works. For example, we struggled with connecting the images taken by Raspberry Pi to AI system. We talked together, and tried many different solutions again and again. However, the letters
                    <em>
                        error
                    </em>
                    kept coming up. We will keep trying to solve this problem.

                    We are very proud of our service that combines Logistics with IoT, AI and Blockchains. Our services can solve many problems with society with this new technique.

                <hr>
                <p>
                    We were able to see some of the possibilities of IoT, AI and Blockchains and come to understand how we can apply these technologies to the real world. We were impressed that we can solve the social problem with technology which we normally use just on the Internet.
In addition, we learned the
                    <strong>
                        importance of teamwork
                    </strong>
                    . Even if I cannot be finished by one person, it can be completed with proper delegation of roles within the team.

                    Not limited to inventory control or ordering, we are going to make systems that can deal with smart contracts in the whole logistics system. With this, we can reduce the time and economic costs so that we can make logistics easier and more automated. And we are going to make a new logistics society. For instance, a highly secured logistics society which the producers and consumers are directly connected. This enables us to change the problematic structure that is based on mass production and mass disposal. So that
                    <strong>
                        we can finally solve the food shortage crisis and reduce the amount of food we waste
                    </strong>
                    .
