                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Two of our team members were skilled in creating games using unity. The other two wanted to take this as a learning opportunity and an opportunity to create a fun game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the fast-paced fun that Dance Dance Revolution provides. We decided to make it more challenging by making users just use their facial expressions to control the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Facial recognition software was used to get facial expressions of users and translate them into emotions, such as joy, sadness, anger and surprise. Our application matches the expressions of users to the emoji's that are randomly appears on the screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Unity game engine to develop the game in C#. Affectiva SDK was used for the facial recognition software.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was our first time using Affectiva and it took us a while to understand how to get facial expressions translated into emotions to use in our own code. The complexity of the facial recognition in our application made it challenging to implement a multiplayer gaming environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After a lot of hard work we were able to implement a multiplayer game that uses facial recognition to enhance the game-play.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt to make a multiplayer game using Unity and implementing facial recognition in a gaming application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Face Off
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to improve the User Interface of the application. By adding more screens and different levels of difficulty to the game. Our next step is going to be adding a tutorial.
