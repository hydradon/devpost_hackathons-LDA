                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for this project was based on the hectic lifestyles of millennials and working individuals in general. With an increase in productivity in workplaces, it is often easy to forget about the importance of self-care. With this, we created Lifestyle, a platform that provides personalized plans geared to anyone looking to improve their overall way of life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lifestyle works by asking the user to fill out a short survey of questions focusing on work-life, time for personal care, dietary preferences, and workout habits. Using this data, the website will generate a customized diet plan and fitness routine to follow for the week. Participants will then follow their plan and track their progress on their accounts. Each account will log their weekly progress, personal information, and any badges earned.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a prototype version of this app to bring out the best features and functionality of our platform. We felt that this would best reflect our ideas for the final aspects of our project, all while maintaining a cohesive theme and aesthetic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we ran into were understanding what features to offer our users and how to make our overall website seem put together. We addressed these issues after brainstorming and analyzing personal needs, community impact, and user accessibility. Keeping this in mind, we created many drafts and made sure to keep our target market in mind.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we chose to work towards a significant problem that is often overlooked in today's community. By applying the skills that we could and stepping out of our comfort zone, we were able to achieve a basic prototype of our website in the given time, all while keeping in mind our target market and initial goals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through Lifestyle, we learned about the importance of working towards a community impact and how to apply our skills for the better. This project has taught us how to maintain a clean user interface, address societal needs, and put forward our best work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Lifestyle
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we plan to add many new features to our website and overall service including delivering fresh produce, tracking water intake, and a wider variety of dietary and fitness plans
