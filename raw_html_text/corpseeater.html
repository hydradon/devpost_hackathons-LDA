                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Matthew 24:28, "Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will gather."
This section in the Bible describes the signs of the end of times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A short tile-based game featuring movement, animations, dialogue, item pick ups.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built with the base game framework Bitsy, with an additional hack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game was initially made for a standalone framework, but time and energy restrictions prevented us from finishing this framework in time. To ensure we had something to present, we moved the CorpseEater assets over to a basic pixel game maker and used that framework instead.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The basic UI design, certain animations, the atmosphere of the story, completing the game in time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned many javascript hacks that can expand the potential of the tiny Bitsy engine; this knowledge will be very useful in the future if we use Bitsy again. Learned techniques for effective tile-making, sprite animation, and creative abstraction for pixel art.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CorpseEater
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CorpseEater's character is a concept that has stood alone from this game for some time (in our minds). We hope to at least add some more interactions and functionality to this basic game, move it over to the intended framework, and possibly expand the story.
