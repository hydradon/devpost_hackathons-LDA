                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My inspiration is the idea of not letting one paper (resume) define your capabilities and strengths. There have been many situations where one incident or one test defined me in the society. For example, in 2016 I woke up one day to find myself being violated by my biological father. After that day I was defined by that one incident. During that time period PSAT was taking place,while taking the test I realized that not one thing can define a person. I have wanted people to know that a student comes with more than just a perfect score or a unfortunate incident. A student is a child at heart and likes to explores vast things in this world and should be defined by their resilience and strengths. Being a math major I decided to travel over to NJIT by taking 5 hour of public transportation commute in order to make a website in a programming language I never used. Meet Alisa is intended for the public to know some things about me that I want them to know.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, Meet Alisa defines myself with couple of my involvements at Rowan University. The website includes a color theme that also symbolizes my personality traits. There many button triggers which allow you to go through the website without having to scroll much. As well as a trigger button that rolls you back up to the top of the page.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By using Visual Studio Code and with the help of Bootstrap, I built Meet Alisa. Also, I used the developer tools in order to see Meet Alisa change live.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of main challenge I had were syntax errors that caused the Meet Alisa, website, to break.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud to have created my first website in 24 hours with very little sleep and freezing weather. This website means more to me than just another project, Meet Alisa defines myself more than a resume as well as, allows employers to see my skills in action.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To be honest I had thought programming was not for me since sometimes I would not know what my peers were saying. Not being a Computer Science major and only a minor in Data Analytics, I have learned that I enjoy programming and will continue programming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Meet Alisa
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to change my website, Meet Alisa to a more formal and professional website where, I can one day give the URL as my resume to employers.
