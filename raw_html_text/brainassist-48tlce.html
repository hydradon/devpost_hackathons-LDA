                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To work towards a world which nobody suffers in silence, and building social support systems for those in need.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BrainAssist serves multiple purposes: as a database that displays trends in good days or bad days, to encourage users to gain the confidence to reach out to their peers who might be in need of help, and to gather data for researching the epidemiology of mental health.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BrainAssist was built using Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Several issues that restricted our group to making further improvements were compiler issues and lack of experience in certain aspects of development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of creating a tangible application that satisfies the criteria for what we defined as "Phase 1" for our application's development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From this experience, we learned that shared Android resources are difficult to use since anything in the raw data folder is read-only, and how to teach ourselves how to code in a short amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BrainAssist
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project was divided into 3 phases in its developmental stages. Phase 2 is a bot using Indeco message analysis that user can talk to for mood assessment. Phase 3 involves Facebook integration for anonymous encouragement from friends.
