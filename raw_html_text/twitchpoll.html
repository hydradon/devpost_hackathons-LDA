                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before TwitchHacks, we were brainstorming about what our Twitch Extension should be. As a Twitch viewer, Jeremy proposed the idea of an extension that could allow streamers to create polls in order to interact with their audience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The streamer can pull up the overlay, type in the question and answers, and propose the poll to the viewers. Then, the viewers can press on the overlay and input their opinions. From there, the results will be presented in a fun colorful graph!
