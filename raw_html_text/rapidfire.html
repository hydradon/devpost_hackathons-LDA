                <p>
                    Personal finance is a passion of mine. I wanted to do a project that was personally interesting as well as aligned with the title sponsor Intuit. The name is a play on the theme of Intuit's product suite - an adjective related to speed followed by the context of the tool. i.e.
                    <em>
                        Turbo
                    </em>
                    <strong>
                        Tax
                    </strong>
                    ,
                    <em>
                        Quick
                    </em>
                    <strong>
                        Books
                    </strong>
                    ,
                    <em>
                        Rapid
                    </em>
                    <strong>
                        FIRE
                    </strong>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    FIRE stands for Financial Independence / Retire Early, which is the concept of not having to work for money such as through passive income, and achieving that state at an earlier age than typical retirement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal of my app is to show different graphical information for various calculations needed to plan for retirement. The inputs should be flexible to target certain dollar values or time deadlines.

                    As of posting this: nothing.

                    I wanted this hackathon to be a casual event focused on learning new skills and spending time with friends who I rarely see now that we are all at different stages in life. It was wonderful to spend time working on something fun in a low pressure environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is currently a React app deployed locally with yarn.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first half of the time was spent trying to do fairly complicated things from the ground up. This was not necessary and was all scrapped in favour of boilerplate code for generic app functionality. After this pivot I was better able to focus on more valuable aspects specific to my goals.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a web app was a completely new experience for me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As mentioned in "What it does", I was pleased with my attitude and intentions going in so it was an enjoyable and casual experience.
