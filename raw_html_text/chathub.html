                    We were inspired by the many different chatbot platforms available to us, and wanted to find a way we could easily use them all together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It allows users to design and deploy chatbots to all the important platforms at once through a code-free drag-and-drop interface.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We spun up different VMs to host different bots and customized each one, using flask API to communicate between services. We abstracted what a chatbot was to a point that it could be described in a Json file. We used react for the front end and used many different APIs to do things.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of our biggest challenges was learning react, along with attempting to hook up the back-end and front-end work we did. It was also difficult to learn how to use every single API
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that somehow we learned how to use React and Google Cloud, and were able to get so many APIs working.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the future we want to finish off the APIs and make the UI smoother.
