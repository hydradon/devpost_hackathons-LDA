                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Quantum computing is a entirely new and radical approach to computation. The purpose of this project to make it easier for beginners to start learning about quantum computing.

                <p>
                    This project makes it easier for beginners to start learning quantum computing by visualizing quantum algorithms in the web browser.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python and Javascript deployed on Google Cloud Platform.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to implement a machine learning algorithm on the quantum computer.  We spent the first day of the hackathon trying to do this; until we realized that it is too early for quantum machine learning algorithms because the hardware for quantum computers is not advanced enough. It was also hard to animate a bloch sphere in the web browser based on the gates that were applied to the qubit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to prototype a quantum virtual machine and to visualize quantum algorithms in the web browser in a single day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have gained lot of knowledge on quantum algorithms and how to visualize them on a bloch sphere.

                    What's next for Quantum Computer Virtualization
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for this project is visualizing more complex algorithms like quantum entanglement.
