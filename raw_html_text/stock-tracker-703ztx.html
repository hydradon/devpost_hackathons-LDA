                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app takes a stock token as its input and returns the current price of the stock. It also has an option to display the price history in the form of a graph.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android-studio which utilizes a combination of java and XML. We used iextrading.com to obtain the json file of the stock we are interested in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us have never used Android Studio before so we had to learn as we built our product. One specific problem that we ran into was that the text kept blending in with our colorful background. We tried many approaches and the only thing that worked was a shadow outline that only showed up on our actual devices.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we are fairly new to the Android Studio program, we are proud that we were able to make an app that we would have never imagined possible. We are most proud of the aesthetics of the app, as we used pixel art to create a nice background.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use XML and Java to create an app using Android Studio. Most of us have no experience with the language and we learned it as we built the product. We learned that if we worked hard enough and spent time developing, making an app was within our reach.

                    What's next for Stock Tracker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Stock Tracker is a very simple app that tracks stocks. There are many improvements that we can tweak so that many people would actually use the app to track stocks. These include adding more statistics to each stock and allowing an option to search up stock symbols since most people do not know all the stock symbols by heart.
