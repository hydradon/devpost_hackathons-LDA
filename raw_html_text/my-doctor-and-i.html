                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being a parent of a newborn and constantly seeking nurse advice in the middle of the night for every concern about my child was time consuming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It a virtual assistant nurse application that diagnose patient symptoms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was built using nodejs, ibm watson, and twilio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Knowledge in the domain is very scarce when it comes to available APIS. Normally, this would require a subject matter to come up with a precise solution. Also, there are not much resources who are interested in working on this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did it in less than a day despite our limited knowledge and also partly because we wanted to contribute on the Health Care sector.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What we learned from this is that, there are still so many problems that needs to be tackled on this domain. So there are a lot of improvements that needs to be done.
                </p>

                    What's next for My Doctor and I

                <p>
                    What&rsquo;s next for My Doctor And I?
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Extend the Rule Engine from IBM-Watson to include images and videos. Those resources could be used to provide additional information on a patient&rsquo;s diagnosis.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use more resource as a knowledge base, so that we could come up with a wide variety of diagnosis.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A location API that would cover a lot more doctors with a particular specialty.
                    </li>
