                    The year is 3030, also known as 110 years after the passing of the last survivor of the zombie apocalypse, 30 years after the zombie horde evolved their diet from human flesh to Hard Shell 100% Pure Beef Tacos and the year where you the last surviving taco take your last stand. Will you be soft-shelled and let yourself be eaten or will you stand your ground and not let your taco friends be eaten in vain. The choice is yours.

                    Objectives of the game and its players
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Last Taco is a game simulation for two or more players. One player operates the Oculus Rift and is referred to as the defender. As the name describes, the defender's objective is to maintain his or her survival from the simulated zombies.Those who are not the defender are referred to as the attacker(s) and they may log into our web app and are provided a birds-eye view of the defender's environment through the Oculus Rift. From there, the attacker(s) may deploy the simulated zombies that the defender sees at locations per their choosing. This game encourages attacker(s) to optimize strategy and teamwork to overwhelm the defender. As such, it forces the defender to be persistant and to exercise his or her sharp reflexes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The players that are known as the attackers operate a Javascript and HTML 5 &amp; CSS encoded web app while the defender utilizes graphics and movements that are displayed through the Oculus Rift with C# coding and details from Unity. Sending data back and forth from the defender and the attacker(s) takes advantage of Electronic Art's API and is the backbone of our player to player interaction system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges that we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the primary challenges that we faced was matching the location of where the zombies will be stationed on the attacker'(s) devices with the general area of deployment on the defender's Oculus Rift. Another challenge that had equal or greater priority was matching the direction and path of the zombies on the Oculus Rift with the icons that represented the zombies on the attacker'(s) devices. Overall, a great majority of our challenges came from establishing relationship between the device(s) of the attacker(s) and the Oculus Rift of the defender. Challenges outside the boundaries of device communication involved the decision on whether to incorporate the Myo into our project. We ran several tests with the Myo, however, despite it being an unique addition to the game we concluded that the movements that the player would make would not be comfortable and may be harmful after long exposure and periodic sensitivity of the Myo would cause frustration.

                    Accomplishments that we are fond of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very content with our access to a variety of APIs and hardwares and how we incorporated a variety of these into our game. Our fondness towards this project also regards how we were able to exercise teamwork and communication despite us being strangers at the start of this challenge. Further accomplishments also include on how we are quite satisfied with the skills and knowledge that we gained throughout this journey in game development and the brief yet strong taste of sharing our project to others.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The knowledge and skills that we gained through our participation is quite bountiful, however, one of the more important gains that we took away from this project was that, games like ours and all other experiences regarding game development is so focused on iteration that it forced us to be selfless, to the best of our abilities incorporate all feedback and suggestions, and to be audience orientated.
