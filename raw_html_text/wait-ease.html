                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Personal experiences such as waiting in queue at places like Rathaus, Gym, Klinikum, Banks etc insipired us to come up with a solution that can help people use their time efficiently and digitalize the whole process of queueing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Digitalize queuing system via LoRaWan communication protocol.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used LoRaWan node which reads RFID tag and further sends to Gateway. Further Gateways sends information such as queue information.
                </p>
