                        Disaster Risk Insurance is micro insurance in case of happening disaster by using smart contract.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Any users who fund premiums and match condition can receive insurance money instantly by smart contract.

                        This is the Disaster Risk Insurance project to build a dapp that calls a Honeycomb marketplace API through a Chainlink node over the Ropsten testnet.

                        I apply oracle to this project by using ipStack API mainly through Honeycomb MarketPlace（ChainLink）.

                    <li>
                        Also I learned how to bring oracle by using ChainLink into my project.

                    <li>
                        Next time, I will find disaster area API and implement them as oracle and implement matching logic.
