                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We Wanted to make something using a technology we didn't know. We felt that creating competition with people to clean up their community sounded like a great idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses Google's Cloud Platform and MongoDb to have user's register their data and mark places in their community that would be in need of some cleaning help
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially used React.js as our framework but ran into problems when integrating Google's Map API and geolocation. We then switched to a simpler template using handlebar.js but still using MongoDb as our database. We were able to then easily integrate the map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having to almost reset our project was a tough blow morally, physically, and emotionally on the group; on top of the growing fatigue. We were able to pull through and deploy to a presentable state while accomplishing our main goals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That in 36 hours we can do more than we have done in a week or more. Together, we were able to put our minds together, create new things with technologies we knew little about.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pixit
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It would be to include more features including the Google Map API since it is our main feature. Regional battles between communities for who could maintain the cleanest area sounds like a fun and cool way to preserve the beauty of our city and nature.
