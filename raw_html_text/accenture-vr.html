                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought about people without the ability to travel or go outside being able to experience the world through virtual reality (VR). VR can be used as a solution for both businesses and the people. Businesses can train their employees with a more interactive environment, engaging trainees at a lower cost. People interested in travel can preview their destinations, experiencing the local hot spots.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've come up with opportunities that can be realistically approached with existing technologies or with some production. There are planned phases to roll out, starting with testing, then expanding in scope and customers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was a positive effect from VR therapy for patients suffering from anxiety, trauma, or phobias. Existing technologies could also be used to provide new services and solutions.
                </p>

                    What's next for Accenture - VR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With more time, we could set up a demo of the live streaming for a vacation spot. A model can be made as well to showcase how VR therapy would work.
