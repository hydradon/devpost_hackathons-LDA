                    Ask Alexa a programming question and she will look up the answer on Stack Overflow

                    alexa2.js is an AWS Lambda function that Alexa uses to respond to user's commands. When the user says "open stack overflow", for example, it will respond with a welcome message and ask the user to search for a programming language. When the user then says "search for ",  it will output a pre-determined response.

                <p>
                    Using Alexa to actually connect to the Stack Overflow website and read the webpage is a work in progress. However, index.js has implemented this functionality locally, independent from the Alexa SDK. When a user inputs a title into the prompt, this program will connect to Stack Overflow and respond with an answer with the most upvotes.
