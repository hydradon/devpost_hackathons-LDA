                    PROBLEM STATEMENT

                <p>
                    Women (Style - Entrepreneurship - Human Employment)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    PROBLEM
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Women and career is being classic problem to have in Indonesia, because family-oriented person become majority in Indonesia. Time management for job and family is always the hardest part when the wife works in a company with work-time, so that entrepreneur, especially online shop owner, are the best choice for many house-wifes in Indonesia. The most bought in online shop is fashion and style, it is a great chance for the womanpreneur because this field always grow. There's no a system that help woman to improve their capacitance in online shop, especially fashion, they're need it the most because if it all come in one system, they'll gonna be helped so much. We're also wanna improve the productivity of many tailor in Indonesia in effective ways, because tailor is the second option after being farmer at the most.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Make a system about fashion social media, social media is chosen because it's always a fun way to make and know a trend happened in a real time and also nowadays everytime we're never get off from social media. Why we should make it specific fashion? Because the growth of fashion development is very great, Instagram is used for many online shop owner to make their bussiness happen, but the system made there still annoying for some reason.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Make a network where user, designer, and tailor met, this connection need to be made because when this community happen, everything in fashion industry trend and productivity will accelerate and develop quicker. This also help each other in every part of Indonesia so that an effective ways to improve fashion industry will made.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Make a better system in design production, some issues that come in design production is copyright, because design is published everywhere and easily. Design, especially fashion, usually used to get inspiration or steal the idea, by drawed and published in this community, between each other will protect and care, and also by system will have the documentation. Another issues in design production is subjectivity, that people freely make their own design, but their design actually can be used in better or even productive ways, so that feedback system will make each other give feedback and make them better.
