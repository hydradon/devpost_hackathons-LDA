                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were tired of designating one person to be the score keeper during card games, board games, and tournaments, and we wanted a more convenient way of keeping score that's not paper or in a note sheet. Why don't we delegate this responsibility to the Google Home!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keep track of each player's score during any given point in the game. The Google Action can let you set up a game, add more players to the game, add points to a given player's score, and connect all the scores to a Google Sheets spreadsheet for score-keeping control.
                </p>

                    How we built it

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We used Dialogflow to set up user intents for our score keeping actions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Dialogflow intents then send webhooks with necessary parameters to our python server.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Our server sends Google Sheets API calls to store and evaluate each player's score for the current round.
