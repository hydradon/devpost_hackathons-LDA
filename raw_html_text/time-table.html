                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were thinking of things that are a hassle in our lives and organizing group work came to us
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It looks at two peoples schedules that want to do a group project together and checks to see when they are both available
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Android Studio and java, with no separate apis
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Comparing the users schedule proved to be the most difficult
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to use firebase to allow anyone with wifi to connect and use our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using firebase's api and calendar api in android studio
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Time Table
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More features to allow for time management for solo use.
