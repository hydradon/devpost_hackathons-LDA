                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    it was one of the beginner projects on the Unhackathon forum that gave me a good intro to programming with Adafruit
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Senses colors from a light sensor from whatever is placed in front of it and emits that color on the motherboard which sends the color to the other neopixels on the chain
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I connected the Flora to my computer  and wrote the code through the Arduino program.  I needed to make sure the code was clean as I combined the light sensor with the neopixel chain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    it wouldn't upload all of the time and as a novice I learned that when you put code in the wrong place it gives you an error message when you try to upload it.

                    I got it to work!

                    that Adafruit can be used for many different applications
