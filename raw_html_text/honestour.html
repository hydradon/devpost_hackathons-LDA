                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed this app to solve a problem most college students face when going on college tours: college tours are impersonal and, ultimately, inconsequential in the college application and choosing process. We developed this app for any college student or alumnus to give tours of their college to anyone that wants to go on college tours. This is primarily for prospective students and their families.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our mobile and web applications have slightly different functionality, but the general mechanism is the same.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Speaking to the UI/UX as part of the mobile app dev team, honesTourists (consumers) will:

                    <li>
                        Taken to their specific account home with personalized functionality.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Find a tour guide based on search preferences.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Set up a tour with tour guide.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed the mobile app and web app separately. This was the best way to use our respective skills with essentially two teams working on the same idea, but developing an app primarily independent of the other team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fortunately, we were able to develop two applications off the same idea on two platforms: mobile and web. I think we were able to work together very effectively given the circumstances.

                    We are still figuring out how much more time we can and want to put in the applications. If you'd like to learn more about it or have ideas that would work well for it, feel free to reach out to me!
