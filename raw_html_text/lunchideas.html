                    The problem
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever been in a situation where a group of friends cannot decide where to go for lunch? Well, me too.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    The solution
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Usually all communication in regards to lunch happens on Slack. What if I could create a
                    <em>
                        bot
                    </em>
                    that would suggest us where to go?
                </p>
                <p>
                    To respond to Slack's
                    <em>
                        slash commands
                    </em>
                    I needed a server on the Internet. The fastest way to achieve that was by running it on Heroku.
                </p>

                    </a>
                    you will be presented with a text string that suggests a Venue. This suggestion is one of 10, pulled from Foursquare's API. Unfortunately, due to lack of time, I did not implement any sort of caching, so each request will also hit Foursquare's API :)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Integrating this with Slack was suprisingly simple, I just added the "Lunch Ideas" app to my Slack workspace and I was immediately able to issue _
                    <code>
                        /lunch
                    </code>
                    slash command. The joy!

                <h2>
                    Things I left out
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally, I set out to not only suggest a Venue, but also provide teasing pictures of yummy food and a link to the menu, but again, due to lack of time I had to leave that one out. I also had to leave out validation that checks if request actually originated from Slack :)

                    Things I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to consume a JSON API and marshal/unmarshal JSON objects. That was really fun! I also learned how to deploy an app on Heroku in less than 5 minutes!
