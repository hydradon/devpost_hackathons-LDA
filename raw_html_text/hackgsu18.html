                    Travis and I came from Orlando, Florida to attend our first Hackathon at GSU. We were so excited, but we had no idea of what to create. We came into this counting on joining another team to get used to the environment. The first night, we teamed up with two GSU students who had been to the event before with the intention of building a web application of some kind. We looked into the NCR and State Farm challenges, while learning how to use Postman to access the NCR APIs. Our team members were local, so they slept in their homes that night. However, on Saturday, we never saw the other team members. They never returned to the event to our knowledge. That left Travis and I to come up with our own project. We started researching React.js and going through some tutorials to familiarize ourselves with the application might run. After several hours, we moved into a brainstorming phase where we focused on finding a social problem to fix or alleviate. Originally, we wanted to design an app to get kids to interact with each other, with a reward system for not using their phones/tablets. However, after exploring that avenue, we felt inadequately prepared to tackle that solution in just a weekend. We moved on. We began talking to some other developers outside of us about ideas and problems we could pursue. Eventually, we came upon community development. We decided to design an application that would bring people together about a common goal. CShare is designed as a place where users can post community projects and opportunities, and other people who might be interested in volunteering their time or donating can get connected to the idea. Travis and I shared a mutual passion in getting a community of any kind away from electronic devices. Even though we are computer science majors, we understand that smart devices have made it harder for the new generations to communicate in a social setting. CShare is a great opportunity for people of any age to get out and create memories that they will remember the rest of their lives.
