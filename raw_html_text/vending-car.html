                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally wanted to build a car, but it was too boring. We thought a vending machine would be cute.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The car runs with two motors controlled by an infrared remote control with capabilities for forward and backward motion, differential steer, and variable speed. On top of the car is a mini vending machine with an option for two snacks. There are four buttons and an LCD screen in which you must input the correct code to get the snack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first prototyped all the circuitry on a breadboard and gradually added components. There are two separate circuit components and microcontrollers for the car and vending machine. At the same time, we spent a lot of time in the hardware area building the car itself using wood, acrylic, and aluminum framing.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The circuitry got complicated with parts for the car and all the wiring needed to supply power to both microcontrollers all from a battery. Building the car itself was also a challenge with limited supplies and tools.
