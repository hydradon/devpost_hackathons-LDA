                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by one of our team members who fractured his ankle but never got it checked out because he did not recognize the symptoms. Therefore, we decided to make injury detection easier by developing Injury Detector.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user selects the location of the injury on the graphical interface and then completes a questionnaire about their specific pain location and symptoms experienced. Then the app sends a query to the World Wide Web, using the Google Search API, which parses through the first 10 search results and identifies the top most likely injuries based on a thorough analysis of the websites.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio for the application and Java with the Google Search API for the backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially programmed in Python; however, we soon discovered that it was extremely difficult to integrate a Python program with Android Studio. So, we were forced to transpile our code to Java, a language supported by Android Studio. We also struggled with slower methods of extracting data, and also had difficulties getting the Google Search API to work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to implement the Google Search API and effectively analyze search results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the Google Search API along with integrating it with Android Studio.

                    What's next for HackTJ Project
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will continue to refine our search techniques to produce more accurate injury predictions, and expand our database of symptoms and injuries.
