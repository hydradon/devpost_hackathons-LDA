                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the facebooks free basic platform and saw there were no games on their platform 
so we decided to write a simple turn based chess game that follows free basics specifications
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we ran into a huge challenge from the start
we could not use javascript on the frontend so that limited us to only using  javascript on the back end and run 
the game and UI only using CSS HTML and a bit of handlebar to accomplish our project
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                    Our plan is to have more and varied games all on this platform
