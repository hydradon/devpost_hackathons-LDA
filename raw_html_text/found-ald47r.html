                    We wanted to do something that raises awareness to an issue that is very pertinent in the real world. To help our society, we decided to focus on natural disasters and the trauma caused by them to those who are affected by the disaster. We wanted to learn how to develop a facial and/or visual recognition software that we can potentially incorporate in an app for the future. We used the IBM API as well as Python and Linux-based commands to develop our idea. In addition, we wanted this app to use length and depth perception to potentially locate missing bodies by scanning the area with a camera.
