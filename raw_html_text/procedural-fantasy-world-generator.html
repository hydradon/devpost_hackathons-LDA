                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've always been a fan of fantasy novels like Lord of the Rings, and fantasy video games like Dark Souls and Dwarf Fortress. I've always admired the deep and intricate settings that my favorite books and games are set in. Another type of game that I'm a fan of are roguelikes- text-only games that rely on player imagination and complex, procedural generated worlds. The concept of randomly creating fantasy worlds with formulas and starting conditions has always intrigued me.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses procedural terrain and history generation to create a fantasy setting much like Middle Earth in the Lord of the Rings.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the Love2d framework and Lua to create it.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I came into Love2d and Lua without any good prior experience- Lua, being dynamically typed and having a (from my view) weird class and object system, was a challenge to learn.
