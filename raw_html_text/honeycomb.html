                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made the landing site using HTML, CSS3 and we made the back end for the API using python.

                    Challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many challenges and quickly learned we had no idea how to connect the front end of the website the the back end without a server.

                    Moving forward

                <p>
                    Being that for most of us this is our first hackathon this was mostly a learning experience, but we know what we need to learn moving forward. That is, we need to more fully unders.tand how to code and come in with an idea of what we want to do already
