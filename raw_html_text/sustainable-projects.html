                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make it easier for city employees to find the optimal spot for sustainable projects in the hope that cities become more green and sustainable. Sustainable projects are things like the addition of solar-powered trash compactors for public use and vegetation roof top installations.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finds the best location for a sustainable project.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used ArcMap and ArcGIS Pro to create a geoprocessing model which was published to ArcGIS for Server/gp service created. That gp service is consumed in an ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Problems syncing up coordinate systems. Permissions issues across internal ESRI networks. Issues extracting dynamic output.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting a fairly complex model built and the service working in a short amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Spatial references can be really tricky even when you think you know how they need to work. Learned how to troubleshoot gp services. Learned how to get dynamic inputs and outputs working and connected to the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sustainable projects
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to expose more parameters on the front end so users can customize the analysis on the back end. We could develop it for devices. Improve the weighting analysis on the backend.
