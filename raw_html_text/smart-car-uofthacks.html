                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app allows users to control parts of their car through the app using the SmartCar Api. The user can unlock, lock, locate and view details about their car at any time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created an Android app that is a front end client for our back end node.js server that interacts with the SmartCar Api with the functionality of controlling multiple cars with persistent storage. We decided to use a web server as a middleman with SmartCar because it provides opportunity to regularly retrieve and analyze information about the vehicles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Obtaining the security certificates needed for SmartCar to call our redirect uri through a secure connection. Ensuring proper logic flow when combining individual work to the group project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about the importance of designing coherent and modular software. We also gathered insights into networking protocols and procedures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing firebase for persistent object storage in order to create analytics based on driving time and locations that your car goes. We would utilize the node.js server to request data about saved vehicles at fixed intervals to provide semi-continuous data that will then be interpreted from the app.
