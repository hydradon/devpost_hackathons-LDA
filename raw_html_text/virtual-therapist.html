                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt from some videos and articles that how so many people facing mental issues should try and have a talk with someone, we got an idea like how about the immediate help for the people is their own virtual assistant!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa acts as a Virtual Therapist where it tries to start a conversation with the person trying to reduce the level of the issue he is facing. It plays songs, reads stories and also makes calls for the person in order to reduce their level of stress and depression
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using the Voiceflow and AWS interfaces specially made for Alexa, where we created special intent and choices for the person talking with Alexa. We also set up an external API with Alexa where it fetches random jokes from a website to lighten up the mood
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced problems while coming up with the responses for Alexa to respond to the user.
We also faced trouble when we were trying to classify the inputs from the users (for ex: user can show affirmation
in many ways: Yeah, Yes, Sure, etc)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to say that Alexa can now solve over three mental issues by so many different ways. (Music, Story, Calling, Jokes, etc).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Virtual Therapist
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Virtual Therapist will try and expand its base by including more mental issues and by increasing the number of 
ways with which she can solve the issues.
