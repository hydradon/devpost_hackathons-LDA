                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The tedious process of verifying and submitting hours for required volunteering can be very frustrating. We wanted to create an app and website that makes this process easier and more streamlined. We also wanted to create a central location to find all sorts of volunteering opportunities for all interests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app allows you to find relevant volunteer opportunities around you. Organizers may register accounts in order to put their organization in the app, and students can search for volunteering opportunities to based on location proximity and what category of volunteering they wish to volunteer in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created an Android app using Android Studio. We also created a website using html and javascript in Visual Studio Code with similar functions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulty learning to use Android Studio, as it was our first time using the IDE. Similarly, creating the website was further a challenge as we only had basic knowledge of javascript and css.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create a functioning app that will help students find volunteer opportunities and keep track of their hours. We also proud of learning to use Android Studio; this was our first time in app development. We are also proud of our website as we were able to start from scratch, both coding wise and knowledge wise, and accomplish a good bit in 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics of Android Studio, and how using Android Studio is very tedious. We also learned how to collaborate on projects as we had to delegate work based off each of our individual strengths and then communicate the project and get the all the pieces to fit together
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TopTeer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to promote TopTeer's use in schools across the nation to make volunteering easier for all students. We would also like to expand TopTeer to allow employees to track volunteer hours that are required by their employers. This would drastically reduce the hassle of processing and verifying volunteer hours, encouraging more people to volunteer since people who used to be discouraged by this hard process will no longer be discouraged now.
