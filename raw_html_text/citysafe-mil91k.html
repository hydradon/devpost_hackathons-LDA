                    CitySafe, an app geared towards providing crime data for a particular city/ location with an interactive map, was inspired by the concerns of college students who work, study, and live in urban locations in which crime may be particularly common. This app in particular focuses on plotting the crime data of Baltimore with data displayed as a heatmap -- more red areas would indicate a more dangerous, more concentrated area for crime and the green areas would indicate areas where crime is comparatively less prevalent in comparison to the red areas. The app pulls the crime data, which is available to the public on data.baltimorecity.gov and plots it on the app. Users can very easily analyze which areas are more dangerous than others, and they can use this data to plan their routes around town accordingly.
