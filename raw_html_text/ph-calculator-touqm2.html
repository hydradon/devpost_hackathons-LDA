                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am inspired by my chemistry class and the current unit we are doing
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app identifies the acid and base pairs from a chemical reaction and calculates pH values for increasing volumes of titrant
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Swift for the front end design and added a C++ backend to the project
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since there is no native chart builder for iOS I had to download 3rd person libraries but they were buggy and crashed. In the end, I was unable to utilize a char in my project
                </p>
