                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create something interesting using all sorts of open data. This project appeals to us because it has funny elements.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Predict the spread of the virus/disease based on the location, commuting between district, employment rate, population &amp; wage + give you morbid thoughts of the future.

                    Challenges we ran into

                    <li>
                        Too much data sets that do not exactly match
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Difficult to incorporate/combine data for wanted results. (e.g. getting Local Authorities' boundary coordinates)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Severely lack of APIs which resulted us in downloading datasets and converting them into database tables.

                    <li>
                        We went through 5 hours of thorough planning, weren't tempted to tap away on our keyboards until we were done planning.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Although we did not manage to properly crunch the data we have, we still managed to get some sensible information.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We went through hell digging for datasets in open data websites (e.g. ONS, Data.gov.uk, etc).
