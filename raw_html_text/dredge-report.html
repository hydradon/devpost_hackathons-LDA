                    Pulls social interaction data from subreddits and uses it to rank presidential candidates.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started by making the back end using python and the reddit API. We pulled the data from the subreddits using the api, then sorted and processed in our python script. Then we used an html based site to visual the data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Data visualization on the domain that we were given by domain.com was extremely difficult. Also finding the correct API library for reddit was a challenge as the design library was not current.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally started on a hardware-based project and realized rather late that we would be unable to complete it to our exacting standards in enough time. We then got distracted by the Splunk capture the flag challenge, which we all enjoyed. We are all proud of finishing our hack in a more compressed timeline than we originally planned for. As well as figuring out data visualization given that we are all freshmen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to more effectively create programs that work with API to pull data from a service, as well as store, process, and visualize that data in an efficient manner online. All of these are things that we did not imagine being able to do, much less by ourselves.

                <p>
                    We will try to continue building the database of user interactions as well as expanding it to Twitter and Facebook with a more advanced algorithm.
