                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team was tired of missing networking opportunities at events. So we built a solution to reduce the chance of missing vital in-person connections. Now you can meet new people and ensure accountability while supporting your favorite nonprofits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We want to encourage meetings, but we know when you&rsquo;re at events things happen. So this is about helping people network, grow their networks to accomplish goals. Not wasting time by not having as many flaked meetings.
                </p>
                <h2>

                <p>
                    WitWay connects you with the most relevant people at events and helps you schedule meetings. Meetings are staked with ETH to ensure accountability. If one person misses the meeting without prior notice, their stake becomes a small donation to the other person&rsquo;s charity of choice.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first made user stories, then made mockups. Following that, we used React Native so that we can easily make both an Android and iOS app from the same code. This Javascript connects to a backend built using Django, as well as Ethereum for our staking function. The django app was dockerized for easy and quick deployment and I used multiple open source libraries to support the effort. Web3.py helped us connect with the Ropsten test chain via websockets. Django rest framework allowed us to totally decouple the front and backend from one another and rely on the API as the sole communication. Gunicorn and the wsgi standard supports the serving of requests, and the whitenoise package extended django to serve static files like css and html.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was the first time the front end devs using React Native, so there was an ample amount of learning all along the process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dockerizing the backend was a headache at times, as not all the docker python images supported the gcc compiler, which I needed to connect to the blockchain. I spent the last year coding in Java and spring-boot, so returning to django required a refresh of design patterns and best practices. The documentation of the web3.py package for ethereum connection was at times frustrating, and I had to iterate a fair amount before I was able to successfully sign and send raw transactions on chain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our team was located in both American &amp; European time zones, making it somewhat difficult to collaborate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building a real UI and a functional product within 9 days. 
Ambitious project having functional backend and a frontend. Decentralized team and got it accomplished.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I&rsquo;m super stoked to have a dockerized app that builds without any need to fiddle with the code. 34 backend commits and roughly 20 hours of work later the product we&rsquo;re presenting is way more polished than I expected given 9 days. We even have tests :D
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned how to build a quick, nimble tech team. 
Where blockchain can be applied strategically to add value, verses being forced into something in which it may not be best suited. 
We learned the importance of having a strong designer to enhance our UI/UX even in such an early stage. 
Design is fundamental to products people will actually use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We&rsquo;re not stopping with this, we&rsquo;re going to continue on to build this out and get a nonprofit/NGO audience to use it and start connecting with each other. We'll be adding a geo-calendar component to make discovering overlaps with you network easier. We are going to reach out to the organization we've identified as partners to validate the need for this app.
