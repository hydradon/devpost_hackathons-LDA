                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teen suicide has been on the rise for many years now. Since 2006, teens have been experiencing a 70% increase in suicide rates and a large increase in depression and anxiety. This crisis is something that needs to be address so as to ensure the health and safety of our population. If healthcare professionals have the tools they require to assist at risk individuals, maybe this epidemic can be slowed or even stopped.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of hard work and not a second of sleep. This was our first time building an application about something that hit so close to home. As a part of this generation we are experiencing a rapidly growing crisis in teenage suicide, depression and anxiety.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning the google cloud suite was very challenging as we have never interfaced with it's technology and APIs before. Understanding the ins and outs of cloud technology was huge in completion of this project. We also wanted to focus on adhering to a design standard. Something that would be pleasing to look at and pleasing to use. Since this was neither of our areas of expertise, we were happilly suprised with how well it turned out based on the hard work and grit we put in.
