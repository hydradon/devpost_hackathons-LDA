                    Let's talk about how I fail in this challenge
                </h2>
                <h3>
                    My Original Plan
                </h3>
                <h4>
                    1. Collect Static data
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Like temperature, wind speed, gas price, stock prize, geolocation data. Also, categorical data like if there's a wildfire, storm, economic crisis are also included.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    2. Collect real-time data (for text mining usage)
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Using Facebook and Twitter API to scrape real time comments from users. Evaluate their emotion and take it as the factors
                </p>
                <h4>
                    3. Machine Learning methods
                </h4>
                <p>
                    I would apply the random forest first. After applying some feature selection methods, I would continuously apply deep learning like CNN or other neural networks
                </p>
                <h4>
                    4. Goal
                </h4>
                <p>
                    before forecasting the average energy usage, I'm more prone to know
                    <strong>
                        what factors influence users behavior toward using energy
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    In sum, I hope to predict the energy usage in an user's perspective. I believe this may help with your forecast :) However, I am too naive. I encountered several difficulties to find and manipulate data sets.

                    1. Collect Data
                </h4>
                <p>
                    (a.) Failed to scrape current and forecast demand data

                    (b.) Could not find climate data in year 2017

                <h4>
                    2. Manipulate Data
                </h4>
                <p>
                    The most difficult part is to manipulate each 15 minute records. Even though I could collect the data, I failed to convert those 15 minutes data into an hourly data (*note: there're bunch of database which do not provide 15 minutes data).
                </p>
                <h4>
                    3. Draw time series plot
                </h4>
                <p>
                    It seems to me that I still need to improve my data manipulation skills especially in cleaning the
                    <strong>
                        Datetime
                    </strong>
                    column. I often got the same error messages like "Error: Invalid input: date_trans works with objects of class Date only".

                <h3>
                    What I learned
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Although I did not finish this project, I still learn a lot of data manipulation. Also, this experience motivates me to approach to many data resources and play with it. It's a pity I failed in the end, but I would continuously stride forward to the road of data forecasting :)
