                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have suffered from a condition called Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) for over 15 years. I discovered that tracking my symptoms on paper or on existing applications was very difficult. I had to take matters into my own hands.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To learn more about ME/CFS, please visit my blog:

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I originally created My Journal to help people such as myself suffering from a chronic condition to track day to day symptoms and vital signs. My Journals reports can be used to support disability claims, but also to provide historical trends of the patients health condition. My Journal iPhone eDition features an easy to use graphical interface, but the web version will work in any modern browser. The enhanced interface is designed to be easy to use for patients suffering from significant mobility and/or cognitive issues (even for typing and clicking).

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The My Journal iPhone edition app is built in Apple Xcode and is written in swift. The backend was created on the LAMP stack running on AWS.  Graphing features were created with the Google Charts API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adapting my original My Journal application for smaller screened devices proved challenging.  With the help of my good friend Rob after a few intense design jam sessions, I think we have accomplished what we set out to do.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am creating a series of apps that I believe will be able to help people like myself facing chronic illness.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest lesson here is the importance of UI/UX, the goal is to reduce complexity for the user by shifting it to the developer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for My Journal iPhone eDition
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hope to continue development of the My Journal series of apps and to share them with patients suffering from chronic illnesses that require detailed tracking.
