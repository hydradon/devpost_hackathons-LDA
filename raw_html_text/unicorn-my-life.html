                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted a quick and easy project that would unicorn-ify my photos. I chose to do this using a random rainbow filter. I wanted to challenge myself by not using any external libraries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also wanted to create a random rainbow animation for the OctoCat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are two pages one allows upload of a photo, there is a variety of filters and masks.  On submit a random rainbow will colourise the photo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using html and JavaScript.  There are 2 html pages and 2 JavaScript pages, had i had more time i would have condensed this down to one JavaScript page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The rainbow effect should have been considerably easier, however it too me a long time.  I also had trouble with my web server so i hosted it on git hub.  I also wanted to tilt the filter to the side, I did not have time to do this.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am pleased with the ease of use of the site.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have never used Git hub to publish anything.  It is really useful.
                </p>

                    What's next for Unicorn My Life
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I might continue to develop the filter so that it slants to the side. I would also like to add a slider to adjust the brightness. I will use it n the future to put random effects on my photos.
