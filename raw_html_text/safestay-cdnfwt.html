                    Overview
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Safestay is a web app that seeks to help users affected by any natural disaster connect with nearby people who are willing to help out by providing them a place to stay, resources, or even just any kind of support.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Plan
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ideally, we want the user to be able to choose whether they need help or want to help after logging on Facebook. 
If they choose to help out, they'd fill out additional information about where they're at, what resources they want to offer, and if they have any room for housing, how much space they can hold. 
If someone needs help, they'd be redirected to a map. The map would show the affected area (with data provided by NOAA or other sources) with different places of people who are willing to help out. On the side, there would be a list of all these locations ranked by closest distance to your location. By clicking a location, you'll be able to internally message or with the other person that could help you out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Where It's At
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently the app is a standalone web application hosted on Heroku. By logging into your Facebook account, you'll continue as someone who needs help and redirected to a map with nearby people that willing to help out.
The app has a long way to go, but we believe that the idea has potential and can be a really useful tool when completed!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Future Goals
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we would want this feature to be implemented within a social media network, like Facebook instead of a standalone application. We'd then be able to expand the use of the "Check-in" feature already built in, as well as using Facebook Messenger as a method to communicate between the people.
