                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students who study without reminding ourselves to take breaks and eat, we felt that it would be helpful to create a conversational chatbot that cares about your well-being and success

                <h2>
                    What it does

                <p>
                    The most productive couch potato you will meet.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to build the app using Microsoft Bot Framework and C+.

                    Thinking of effective and unique functions as well as new and fresh ideas that other competing productivity chat bots don't have.

                <p>
                    Emily learned HTML/CSS for the first time.
We learned how to compromise and collaborate as a team, consisting of members who met for the first time, to work efficiently and productively.

                <p>
                    We wish to develop the app for Spuddy Buddy and put it out on the market for the general public, so that in 2.5 years we can put it on a platform such as Slack or Kik Messenger.
