                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This connects to canvas and gets all the information about the classes and assignments from the website, parses the information, and answers any questions you may have about your assignment or classes.

                <h2>
                    How we built it

                    We found a resting Canvas API and used it to gather information from the website
