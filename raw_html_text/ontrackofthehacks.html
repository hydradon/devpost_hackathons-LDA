                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are life hacks for almost anything. Seeing as most of them are untapped, we decided to build an app that would bring everything together into one platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It scrapes the web and gathers information about life hacks pertaining to the input provided by the user and puts it together right at the user's fingertips. It also offers a link to a good resource to find out more about these lifehacks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it by using the JSoup and URL classes to scrape the web and we used if blocks to parse the HTML code and we were able to determine what to display.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The URL class is very limited in its options and because our resources weren't as up-to-date as we would like them to be, we had to make a lot of changes before we could actually start.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of accomplishing to scrape the data with large success and do so in an effective manner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that external JAR's an be very useful and are very specialized to perform certain tasks. For example, JSoup is much less restricted than the URL class and was much more effective in getting the task done than the URL class.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for OnTrackOfTheHacks
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for us is to develop a firebase were we can store all user searches. This way, we can look at the most popular searches and the changes in the trend of searches within our app on a global level and it will enable us to move OnTrackOfTheHacks to the next level. After that, we can implement user accounts which will allow users to access their accounts from multiple devices and also allow us to add a recent searches option in case the user would like to visit his or her recent searches. In addition, with the implementation of artificial intelligence, which we will develop through data gained by the firebase, we will be able to provide recommended searches which will be user specific.
