                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our goal during this hackathon was to build a data-heavy hack. We realized, in fact, that devpost was an incredible source of data! With 56,000 total projects available to analyze, this was the perfect direction for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to build a project that uses past hackathon project data to inform and help hackers. Specifically, our hack:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Data visualizes past data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Generates project name / project idea given past projects, and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Determines your project's chances of winning a prize.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web application stack includes the following:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Backend:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        API Layer: We wrote a Python Flask API layer to communicate with our front-end.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Analytics: We leveraged Python for all of the data scraping and manipulation into proper formats for the front-end.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>
                            markovify
                        </code>
                        : We used this library to, given a corpus of past projects and names, generate project names and projects.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        IBM Watson: We used this technology to tag projects with keywords. We also wrote our own, separate method for keyword generation. Using this, we're able to understand how a project ranks against others in the context of winning.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Key challenges included:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        API Keys: we were limited by the number of API keys available, so we had to be creative in how to use them and how to substitute our own techniques.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Key libraries: we realized that libraries such as
                        <code>
                            markovify
                        </code>
                        were layers of abstraction that, without a clear understanding of how they work, were not 100% useful. We had to make sure we understood how and why those libraries worked and how we could shape the input for the best output.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're really excited that we have a full web application that has a ton of potential. However, the best moment came when the following randomly-generated project was outputted, showing us that even one project created thanks to our generator would be worth it:
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>jane is a platform that serves up real-time information on bed availability and predictions on when their shelter will fill up in an open format that all can use, via public apis.
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a ton of new technologies and were challenged with a really cool data-driven project. In the future, we're really excited to push our limits in this space.
                </p>
