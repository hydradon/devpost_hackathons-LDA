                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    $11M. dollar were scammed out of people in bitcoins due to the WannaCry virus, a malicious software that targeted hospitals for records.
                    <strong>
                        decrypt the currency
                    </strong>
                    lets us teach people how to get into the crypto currency field in a much more secure and interactive way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created an interactive environment on-top of IBM's open-mainframe by implementing a block chain  in our server, allowing us to keep the users data secure and Oculus VR integrated with amazon alexa for the best user experience

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Oculus VR to visualize the exchange with the amazon alexa as an instructor to keep track of the calculation in the crypto currency field.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building a REST interface in unity to communicate with the server side.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working successfully as a distributed team, two front end developers with two platforms engineers. Everyone worked on separate parts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Separate teams working with different languages across the front and back-end lead to communication challenges and design difficulties. While not ideal, implementing the entire project in a single language (C or JavaScript) may have lead to better results.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a framework to build the front end in an extensible fashion and creating automation that will allow the NodeJS back-end to distribute across multiple servers.
