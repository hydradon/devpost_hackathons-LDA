                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's often difficult for us to find time to actively cut down on our energy consumption in a highly technological world, so we decided to tackle a small but very important part of our lives: showering. It may not seem like much, but excess shower time not only wastes water but also wastes a lot of energy in the form of hot water, leading to higher costs for consumers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SmartShower was designed to benefit the consumer by monitoring water usage during showers and gradually shifting to shorter and shorter shower times, in turn saving money. Data collected from the showers can be viewed in the accompanying app, which is used to keep the consumer aware of how much money and water is cumulatively saved. Users are prompted to set their own goals and can keep track of their weekly, monthly, and annual progress. Throughout the duration of a shower, LED lights signal when a user is approaching a suggested limit on water.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an Arduino Uno paired with a water flow sensor and HC02 Bluetooth module to wirelessly transmit recorded data to the app. The LED strip is controlled by the Arduino, and changes color based on the water consumption limits calculated from the app.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Learning how to create and develop an Android app for the first time and figuring out how to use the Bluetooth module were the biggest challenges we faced.
