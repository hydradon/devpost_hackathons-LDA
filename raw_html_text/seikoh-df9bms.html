                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all. They have a strong outreach throughout the country, but varying laws for each state coupled with hundreds of pages of law make it confusing for residents to understand policy. If there was a way for tenants and residents to quickly find the information they need without having to hire a lawyer or spend countless hours parsing through documents, this would save a lot of time and money spent on service lines.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sokieh is a lawyer bot at the tips of your fingers that can explain what to do in certain situations. We chose to focus on the Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act for this stage of our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sokieh was built using the Microsoft Bot Framework. We implemented the Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS) to parse through inputs and tag key words.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making the Bot "life-like" and smart enough to understand the users needs was very challenging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    We are very proud of our website integration, using agile methodologies, and machine learning capabilities.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned agile methodologies along the way, more on how the Microsoft Bot Framework works, and Machine Learning capabilities,

                    What's next for Seikoh
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to expand to other states and soon be nation-wide. This is a great platform for people that need a way to get quick information with no cost.
