                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To make learning fun with Tic Tac Toe for Kids.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app allows kids to play tic tac toe and learn at the same time. In order to choose a particular position in the 3x3 matrix, kids need to play mini-games to get their mark on the matrix sheet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using the Android-Studio IDE including languages like java and xml in it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was challenging to link each position of the 3x3 matrix boxes to a new mini game and come back to the same page with updated scores for each player.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to think of such a unique and intellectual idea that would improve the learning for kids and were able to create our Tic Tac Toe game using Android Studio for the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about how to create an app using Android Studio and also prepared the back-end mini games that would be linked to the 3x3 matrix of the Tic Tac Toe.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EduToe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I think it needs to be completed as it is a great idea that would make learning for kids fun and entertaining. Once, the matrices are linked with each intellectually challenging mini game, it would improve their productivity of learning.
