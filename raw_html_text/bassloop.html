                <p>
                    BassLoop is a web-based music production software, where everyone in the entire world can make music at the same time, simultaneously. BassLoop uses a real-time database to manage the sounds played and sync between multiple music producers in the same lobby. Because there's no need for authentication, many different lobbies can be created and multiple people (1k+) can produce at the same time.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used firebase as our live database as well as a lot of javascript for the samples syncing. Different lobbies were created using random id number generators and howler API made things a lot easier for the sound scripting.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firebase documentation is a little bit raw and many problems occurred with database linking and removing. Also, one of our biggest challenges was to make all the samples sync.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Any samples you put together will sound good, that was one of our main goals. Making good music.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that javascript can be very powerful for sound manipulation.
