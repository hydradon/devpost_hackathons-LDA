                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As an RA, I need to complete a handwritten duty log every night that I am on duty. It is a very out of date system and  inefficient since staff members of the building cannot see what is happening in the building in real time. So, we created a sms service that allows RA's to text a service about what is going on in the hall that night and include mandatory information required by professional staff like maintenance issues and start times for rounds. Also, this system will allow staff members to access a database of duty logs so that we can see what has happened on a specific night and notice patterns throughout the building.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This service takes texts sent by RA's and puts that information into the mandatory duty log. Information that it includes is interactions with residents, start and end times for rounds, maintenance issues, and any notes for professional staff members.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created this service by using Java, Mysql, and twilio.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were able to get a proof of concept working and able to complete a duty log along with storing them in the database.
