                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted a better way to organize our messages, and were tired of taking our phone out of our pocket, unlocking our phone, and opening our messenger, just to see that someone said "k"
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Communication Commander organizes your messages into different categories based on different words or phrases that are representative of the priority level. For example, "Call 911" would be urgent, whereas "lol" is unimportant.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed the app entirely in Android Studio
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While the actual texting interface and organization went smoothly, the biggest issue was assigning categories to each text, without either creating massive databases to index constantly, or performing excessive instructions. Despite documentation saying that starting an activity for a result would pause the current activity, it didn't...so we spent a long time working through that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Successfully creating an app that can do large scale indexing and organization without wasting time and ruining the UX.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Deeper insight into the activity lifecycle of android apps and greater experience coding in android studio.
