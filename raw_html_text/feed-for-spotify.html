                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It always frustrated us that while Spotify has the ability to follow others, there is practically no functionality for it. Likewise, previously Spotify would notify you any time an artist you follow uploaded a new album, but they removed that functionality and changed it to their weekly release radar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Listens for changes in the playlists for a user, and sends those changes to the server as a post to everyone who follows that user. Likewise, sends a post to any user that follows an artist when they release a new album.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used Angular for the front end, and made a REST API with Node.JS and Express to handle Spotify Web calls from the front-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Spotify doesn't allow you to find who a current user is following, so we had to do it in reverse.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    Listening for playlist changes, Spotify Authentication, Great UI.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Backend development, how to design and create REST APIs.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Find a workaround to finding who a user is following, so we can implement the service fully.
