                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through our experience dealing with depression, we realized there was a need for more support. Teenage depression is a big issue happening worldwide, we decided to focus specifically on helping teenage girls. Our team is also very interested in learning about foreign cultures, so we decided to make a website to help support these girls, with many different languages, so that it can be useful worldwide.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website provides resources to help teenage girls around the world find support. Resources include links to support groups and girl empowerment websites, as well as feel-good songs, and inspirational quotes and pictures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started by brainstorming what we wanted to incorporate into our website. Then we drew some wireframe diagrams to provide a layout for the site. We used cloud 9 to get our website up and running. After some research of quotes, links, and general background knowledge, we started writing some HTML code. We then spruced up the website with some styling and organization. Each person contributed to a different part of the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were confused as to what each person was responsible for at first, and how they would do it. We were able to organize ourselves after a consultation with Lisselot, our CEO. We also struggled to stay focus, and sometimes had problems procrastinating.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We finished the website on time! We're also really proud of our carousel on the homepage. It took a lot of time and effort, with some help from a mentor, but we were able to get it working!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teamwork makes the dream work! We learned how to collaborate and listen. We also learned a lot about using divs in our website. We learned how to embed YouTube videos into our site, and gained a lot of experience with styling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for H.O.P.E
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to integrate the Google Translate API so users from around the world can read and understand the website. We also want to provide chat rooms for users to help support each other.
