                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make an application that ailed one of the many problems we had in our day-to-day life. One such problem involved the struggle of attending office hours in a crowded computer science department.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web application streamlines the process behind signing up for office hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python/Django as our server-side scripting language. We used SQLite as our database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were all very inexperienced in web development, as this was the first major web project we worked on and the first hackathon we have participated in. As a result, we had to learn everything along the way. Database design was especially difficult to understand for our team as none of us had dealt with that aspect of back end web development before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being the first hackathon we have participated in, we're proud that we were at least able to create something tangible and working. Additionally, we learned a variety of new technologies and concepts that we wouldn't normally have done had we not embarked on this project together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned the ins and outs of the Django framework, front end design, and databases..
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Boston Kremes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Correctly implement a relational database and be able to link both the front end and the back end to a cohesive website. Our hope is to come up with a final, polished design in the future, as we believe that the issue of inefficient office hours is pervasive in our day-to-day life. If we can solve this problem, we believe it could help a number of people, including ourselves.
