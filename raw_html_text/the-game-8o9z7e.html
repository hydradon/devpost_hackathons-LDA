                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am a huge fan of video games and have always wanted to program one myself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is just a small tidbit of a larger text-based RPG I plan to make.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using Python. It's mostly functions and if statements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am not too experienced with programming, so it was a lot of trial and error to fix some of the bugs I have encountered. Even now, there are plenty of bugs that I was unable to fix given the time I put into working on it by myself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm really proud that I was able to figure out how to get the shop working. I spent over five hours trying to figure out why I couldn't add an item to my bag using .append, so when I replaced it with just a variable name, it worked fine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that input commands need to be set to a variable before being put into if statements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hope to fix up the battle system to add some more depth to the game. Right now, it's more just a text adventure than anything else.
                </p>
