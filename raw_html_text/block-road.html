                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to monetize individual data and allow people to buy data through microtransactions using cryptocurrency.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a solution to integrate blockchain attributes into microservice architectures. Now your Lambdas can yield the power of Smart Contracts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a smart contract to hold the data on the Ethereum blockchain and accept microtransactions to access it.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>

                    Lack of sleep
