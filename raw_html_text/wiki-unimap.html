                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Universities in big cities like London are really struggling to provide enough spaces for students for studying and discussions. As students in UCL we find it really hard to find study spaces somewhere, quite often student end up in library which eventually become overcrowded and noisy! 
    So we wanted to come with a hack which would solve this problems with long standing problems such as finding printers and room Bookings!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Students can post about available empty rooms, the more you post, the more users will upvote you, the more your reputation is! User will be able to find available study rooms in the website and they can mark it filled once it's filled. Users can add printer locations, if there's no printer at that specified location, other users with downvote it and thus the post will get deleted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used BeautifulSoup with Python to scrap the data off the web and passed it to Meteor and built the entire app from scratch
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scrapping LatLon values, we got banned from UCL website for higher volume of HTTP request.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We achieved the desired app. Built an app which is scalable and has a awaiting user base in the universities across the city.

                    What we learned

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are passing it to TechSoc of UCL, who can scale it using the data from ISDs and other departments to make the app more user friendly and resource rich
