                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever wanted to know when the drama club was giving out free pizza? As college students, we sometimes struggle with funds and it can be difficult to find deals that cater to our budget. It can also be hard to know what events are happening for what student organization at what time giving out what stuff, and this way we may miss on swag-portunities if we're not 'in the know'.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SwagHaul compiles all the free deals on campus and around campus by pulling data from restaurant websites and community driven submission posts, similar to coupon websites. Our app is specifically catered towards organizing all deals, discounts, and giveaways in a user's area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We divided up the tasks using Trello, then set to work. We created a frontend website using Domain.com's embedded website creator, and we created an app using Visual Studio in C# and XML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we first began creating our app, we originally started in android studio. It took much longer than expected to get a handle on, so our backend developer switched to what he knew better - Visual Studio. Our frontend developer had trouble trying to create a website using the Google Cloud Server, so we kept just the frontend designed portion as is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our organization and teamwork was unparalleled as we were able to seamlessly get to work. Our backend developer also learned how to better create an app in Visual Studio using C# and XML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes Javascript just doesn't pan out. Domain.com also doesn't truly allow for the connection of a backend unfortunately.
                </p>

                    What's next for Swag Haul
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'll continue developing and finalizing our product - expect to see us again soon!
