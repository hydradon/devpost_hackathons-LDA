                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa was the name of one of our teachers.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa is now the best travel companion, as well as teaching you programming languages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wrote in code in an Amazon service called Lambda with python.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It took us few good hours to make Alexa say something, as it is not that easy programmable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    Make alexa keep a conversation with you, and really teach you something.
                </p>
                <h2>

                <p>
                    We learned how to program an Alexa.
