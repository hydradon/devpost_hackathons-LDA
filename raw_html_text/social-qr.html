                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We became tired of having to ask more than once for people's various social media platforms so we decided a single step process for all social media 'requests' would be beneficial for humanity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It scans a QR code and adds the person who 'owns' the QR code on all social media.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using swift and xcode with firebase as a potential backend
                </p>

                <p>
                    We didn't cry too much and we have a skeleton of an app, with some psuedocode and limited functionalities.
                </p>
