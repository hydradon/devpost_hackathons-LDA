                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In high school, volunteering is a difficult but important task, and we wanted to make it easier and more effective
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It shows you volunteering opportunities around you, and you can easily sign up for them. It also gives you a chance to host your own events
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used some HTML, CSS, Photoshop and invision.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One challenge that we ran into was being able to make everything flow seamlessly, after about 2 hours of work, we were able to make that happen. It was also difficult to think of an idea that hadn't already been taken.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that the functionality of the app is working seamlessly while providing the user with the best experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that great ideas aren't easy to come across and that it takes time and effort to come up with a great idea. 
Sometimes the idea is more important than the execution.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We hope to make this a real website and we hope to expand our horizons to helping the whole country.
