                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After playing around with the HTC Vive in the game room, we decided to program something using VR. It was interesting the way that VR can take you into a whole different world, and we wanted to experiment with that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our VR experience is a small step to developing better VR games, starting with simplistic actions of throwing and interactability.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hooked up an Alienware desktop and a Dell monitor with the Oculus Rift and Leap Motion and started brainstorming to make this VR experience. We used Unity to make this game along with other open sources and source coding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first working with VR, so setting up everything was a struggle in the beginning. We also had our file corrupt, so rebuilding everything from scratch was also a struggle. Editing coding also took awhile, since using the Oculus was something new to us.
***Actually, the worst problem was the really long Windows update XD
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm very proud of the work we were able to do within this hackathon with VR. It was a long process, but we all learned quite a bit from building this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how VR and motion sensors can open a whole new world to the virtual reality. Using teamwork and plenty of ingenious ideas led to where our project is now.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Outside Target Practice
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to build off from this experience and build something even better with VR and Leap Motion next hackathon!
