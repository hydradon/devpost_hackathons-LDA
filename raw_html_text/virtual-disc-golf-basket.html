                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As two students who love to play frisbee golf, we wanted to create something which would allow us to take the fun of golf anywhere.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creates a virtual basket with ultrasonic ping sensors that lets the user know when they have scored a basket
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is built with an arduino uno
                </p>

                <p>
                    The sensors were innaccurate.
