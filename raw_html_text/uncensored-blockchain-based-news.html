                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to explore and utilize blockchain technology after BostonHacks 2018, where a team built a blockchain-based voting system. We decided to build a news platform solution as it is a very relevant use case and continues to be an issue in the present day (as seen in China, North Korea, etc).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    UBBN provides a blockchain-based news network solution for journalists and activist parties to publish sensitive information for the overarching purposes of society's common good. The nature of blockchain technology allows said parties to contribute their findings without the fear of government retaliation or repercussions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the blockchain in Python front-end in HTML/CSS/Vanilla Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing blockchain and PoW validation without any prior experience working with either.
                </p>

                    The whole project; what we learned and created in such a small time frame.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
