                    This project is intended for the everyday user wanting to pass their free time in a fun manner. Among many categories, users will be able to choose their favorite option from two choices. One way this project can be improved is to enhance the category list algorithm to handle many topics. Another way to improve the project would be to enable censoring for specific categories. It would be nice if the "leveling up" functionality was enhanced; this would involve the completion of the interactive horizontal bar graph on the profile page. We would like a way to replace the appropriate profile picture that matches to each account using firebase. Ultimately this is an application you can play on the go with your friends and family.
