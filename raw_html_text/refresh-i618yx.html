                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At reFresh, we are a group of students looking to revolutionize the way we cook and use our ingredients so they don't go to waste. Today, America faces a problem of food waste. Waste of food contributes to the acceleration of global warming as more produce is needed to maintain the same levels of demand. In a startling report from the Atlantic, "the average value of discarded produce is nearly $1,600 annually" for an American family of four. In terms of Double-Doubles from In-n-Out, that goes to around 400 burgers. At reFresh, we believe that this level of waste is unacceptable in our modern society, imagine every family in America throwing away 400 perfectly fine burgers. Therefore we hope that our product can help reduce food waste and help the environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What It Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    reFresh offers users the ability to input ingredients they have lying around and to find the corresponding recipes that use those ingredients making sure nothing goes to waste! Then, from the ingredients left over of a recipe that we suggested to you, more recipes utilizing those same ingredients are then suggested to you so you get the most usage possible. Users have the ability to build weekly meal plans from our recipes and we also offer a way to search for specific recipes. Finally, we provide an easy way to view how much of an ingredient you need and the cost of those ingredients.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We Built It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To make our idea come to life, we utilized the Flask framework to create our web application that allows users to use our application easily and smoothly. In addition, we utilized a Walmart Store API to retrieve various ingredient information such as prices, and a Spoonacular API to retrieve recipe information such as ingredients needed. All the data is then backed by SQLAlchemy to store ingredient, recipe, and meal data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We Ran Into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout the process, we ran into various challenges that helped us grow as a team. In a broad sense, some of us struggled with learning a new framework in such a short period of time and using that framework to build something. We also had issues with communication and ensuring that the features we wanted implemented were made clear. There were times that we implemented things that could have been better done if we had better communication. In terms of technical challenges, it definitely proved to be a challenge to parse product information from Walmart, to use the SQLAlchemy database to store various product information, and to utilize Flask's framework to continuously update the database every time we added a new recipe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, these challenges definitely taught us a lot of things, ranging from a better understanding to programming languages, to learning how to work and communicate better in a team.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Together, we are definitely proud of what we have created. Highlights of this project include the implementation of a SQLAlchemy database, a pleasing and easy to look at splash page complete with an infographic, and being able to manipulate two different APIs to feed of off each other and provide users with a new experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We Learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was all of our first hackathon, and needless to say, we learned a lot. As we tested our physical and mental limits, we familiarized ourselves with web development, became more comfortable with stitching together multiple platforms to create a product, and gained a better understanding of what it means to collaborate and communicate effectively in a team. Members of our team gained more knowledge in databases, UI/UX work, and popular frameworks like Boostrap and Flask. We also definitely learned the value of concise communication.

                <p>
                    There are a number of features that we would like to implement going forward. Possible avenues of improvement would include:
