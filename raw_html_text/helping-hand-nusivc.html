                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project was inspired by our lack of easy access to small services such as lawn mowing, snow shovelling, leaf raking, tutoring etc. The logic of the project is modelled after Uber, a rapidly growing application that provides Taxi services to its users
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Helping Hand connects end users to individual small service providers around them for easy-to-access services.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided that we will start Helping Hand as a Web Application, since it matches our skill sets the most. We used HTML to build the body of the website, filling in the content and setting up page redirections. We used CSS to style the pages and make them look more appealing. We used small amounts of Javascript to setup the Map function so the interface becomes more clear and easier to operate. Lastly, we used Firebase as a database and to setup log in credential verification.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we ran into is time. We did not have enough time to implement all the functionalities, such as chatting between users and providers, into the code. To setup the site for a demo, we used hardcode displays and fake data to make the website operable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We implemented a Map with specific pins on it. Each pin corresponds to a an individual service provider. When clicked, a bubble will appear, showing their names, contact information, hourly rate, and the button to request this service.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Firebase as a database and explored its library for useful functions. We learned how to manipulate Git commands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Helping Hand
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for Helping Hand is to finish the missing pages and functionalities for the Web App. Then we will move on to create mobile applications for IOS and Android
