                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to learn about neural networks :D
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its a neural network with support for gradient decent backprop for supervised learning and a genetic algorithm for unsupervised learning (intended for interfacing with games)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of linear algebra and JS
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neural nets matrix math is hard
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we figured it out at the end
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    linear algebra and Neural nets :D
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GeNN
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Make it in a language that isnt constrained to the browser, we dont have too much experience with JS and it seems all le hot companies be using this meme language so we decided to use it too.
