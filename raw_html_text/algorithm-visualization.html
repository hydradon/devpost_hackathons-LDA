                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we first learned the algorithms, professors were using slides for the demos, and sometimes it is confusing. So we decided to build a visualization page for each algorithms for all the beginners at home so they can understand everything easily.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a simple html site with three demo algorithms we implemented: selection sort, bubble sort and binary search.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it in javascript with api j5ps.
                </p>

                    <li>
                        mouse press didn't work
3.When combining everything together, there're some problem with the files.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For me, I learned the JavaScript for the first time! I am really proud of our first project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned JavaScript, and how to work under pressure and a tight deadline. Also improved my communication skills to discuss the progress more efficiently with my teammates.
                </p>

                    What's next for Algorithm Visualization
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will build in more algorithms, improve the visual of the website and maybe add a front page.
