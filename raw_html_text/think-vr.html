                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were looking at the cool hardware available at HackTech and thought of ways to combine them to create novel solutions. One idea that stuck out was mixing Muse and Oculus to do neuro-feedback in a virtual reality environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ThinkVR tracks brain waves with Muse and passes it to Unity which creates a dynamic environment based on the data. In this environment, changes in the users mental state are reflected in a immersive virtual reality environment. Neuro-feedback is already backed by research showing that it's an effective treatment for mental health and this approaches it from a new angle. Also you can order food using the PostMates API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Muse API on backend to pass data to Unity, with various API added to provide additional functionality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We weren't familiar with Unity or C# so understanding a 3 dimensional layout based in a completely new software proved especially challenging. Hooking up and interpreting muse data in an Oculus app also proved quite challenging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In Unity we were able to accurately ray-cast crosshairs to find where the user is looking. Another accomplishment was that Muse sends data through TCP  but C# only has a UDP listener so we hacked Muse to send data in that format instead. Users can order food within the VR app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The basics of Unity, the world of Muse
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Think VR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More moods and environments, custom hardware.
