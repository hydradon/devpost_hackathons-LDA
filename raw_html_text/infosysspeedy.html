                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tom is from the F&amp;A unit of an institutional customer of Bank and is logged on to a third party portal. Tom wants to have an aggregated view of all accounts and their balances that his company owns at the bank and/or with other banks. To have the consolidated view, the commercial banking customers have tough time to manually enquire to bank staff or log on to each banks online banking account individually and check the accounts and balances. This is a lengthy process, leads to loss of productivity, delivers poor customer experience as well as results into errors/ ineffective investment decisions.

                <ol>
                    <li>

                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Chat Bot (Infosys Speedy) using Infosys Nia ChatBot Solution
                    </li>

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Main task was to build integration layer. This should cater requirements of different conversational devices. Like screen size, sentence length etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
