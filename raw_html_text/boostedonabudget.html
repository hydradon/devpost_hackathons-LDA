                    We used the idea of a boosted board and made it significantly more cost effective and increased the ease of use
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: we started with an electric razor scooter, removed the handle bars and mounted a longboard truck system to the front of the board. Next we replaced the existing motor-control board with an Arduino and a new motor-control board. After that we replaced all the wiring and inserted a Bluetooth transceiver. The next step was to create the app to control the board. Using Bluetooth it will communicate with the board to go forward, reverse, stop the motor, and control speed.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: Electrically we were very unknowledgeable, so it was a lot of trial and error to find the correct configuration of wiring. The app was also a struggle. None of our team knew about the development of apps, so it was a learning experience for all members
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of : The Bluetooth connection to remove the need for a separate controller.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: We learned a lot about the hardware in the board aswell as a tremendous amount of work that goes into app development.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BoostedOnABudget: Increase the power of the motor to allow for more load. Create a sleeker design and decrease the weight of the board itself.
