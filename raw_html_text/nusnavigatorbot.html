                    Singapore can be very confusing, even for its students! Countless times have we been late to lessons and appointments because we wasted precious time looking for a way around this maze. That is why we developed NUSNavigatorBot Telegram Bot! Getting you to places @NUS

                    Just kidding. We used Node.JS since we wish to learn a new platform, and Node.JS seems like it is the most appropriate choice for the task -- event-driven application. Moreover, it has various libraries and most importantly, support for functional programming style. We prefer writing in functional style because it is less bug-prone.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our initial plan was to build an app in React Native, only to find out that due to the neck-breaking speed at which it is being developed, many libraries released as recent as 2017 are already broken with the latest release of React Native.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also have to get up to speed quickly on Telegram Bot API (which was easy as it has a good documentation). We also had some problems trying to debug our bot. We only learnt quite late that Node.JS allows debugging via Chrome Debugger Tools.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also had to scrape the data for our bot manually as there is no complete dataset on coordinates of bus stops and buildings in NUS.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to finish everything in less than 12 hours!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Node.JS is awesome! I can finally have a good GUI debugging system courtesy Google Chrome! Yay!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also learnt a bit about React Native and jsx. It would be good to use RN if we were to develop an app without external library dependencies, but apparently it is a poor choice for what we wanted to develop.

                    We can add functionalities to search for any buildings and offices.
