                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration came from the difficulties that people with a disability face and how they must be feeling when dealing with every day situations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Showcase a rather difficult platformer but with the main factor of jumping taken out along with speed being heavily cut down, forcing the player to think outside the box to get to the goal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've built it using the Unity engine with C++ coding along with Photoshop for drawing out sprites and tile sets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to get the game to work properly and learning the ins-and-outs of Unity.
                    <em>
                        We were unable to complete even a level due to difficulties of learning how to use the engine.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Got the basis of the game to work (the movement and some aspects like platforms and intractable objects like enemies and trampolines)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've learned the process that comes from developing a game alongside more information on working with Unity to its fullest.
