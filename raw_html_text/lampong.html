                    DENR&rsquo;s Biodiversity Management Bureau&rsquo;s record shows that in the last 5 years, the confiscated value of wildlife reached PHP 184.9 million due to illegal wildlife trade. But this figure is of a lesser concern compared to greater effects of wildlife extinction. Ecological Imbalance, loss of biodiversity, habitat loss and degradation, over-exploitation, and unsustainable use of natural resources, to name a few.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Philippine Government&rsquo;s effort in eliminating Wildlife Trafficking and Poaching such as Ecosystem Conservation Programs, Biological Diversity Conventions, and coordination with LGUs and Indigenous Community for the protection of Local Conservation Areas is still not enough to address all problems associated with wildlife. These programs will only be truly successful with proactive cooperation of LGUs, concerned citizens, and the availability of an accessible platform in producing a powerful solution against wildlife crimes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our system &ldquo;Lampong&rdquo;, named after the supernatural being based on the Philippine Mythology who protects wildlife animals from hunters, is an integrated mobile and web-based system using crowdsourcing for dynamic mapping and real-time reporting of wildlife crimes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lampong empowers citizens to report crimes through anonymous crime reporting. This will trigger real-time alert and notification of wildlife crime reports in the LGU&rsquo;s web system. It will also reflect on the dynamic map of wildlife trafficking. Lampong will automatically locate the nearest ranger, and the ranger will use Lampong&rsquo;s efficient route finder system to locate the incident and validate the report. Once validated, the LGU can systematically deploy troops or policemen. Motion sensors will also translate alerts to notify LGU of human activities in the protected zones.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All throughout the preparation, from the first day to the competition day, we have witnessed the different wildlife crime preventions that were discussed by the government or the concerned authorities. As a response to it, we have developed a possible solution using our technology to really help them in solving the problems relating the wildlife crime.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The remaining days for the development was about the system approach for the users of the application, highlighting the use of the technology for good and the implementation of User Experience (UX) Design Principles in enhancing the system's functionality, navigation, and accessibility. The application was built using Android Studio, Visual Studio Code and utilizes Mapbox API, Leaflets, Firebase.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lampong will utilize Data Analytics to produce crime prediction and behavioral patterns of poachers.
