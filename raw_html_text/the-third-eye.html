                <p>
                    1.3 billion People have some sort of vision impairment. They face difficulties in simple day to day task like reading, recognizing faces, objects, etc. Despite the huge number surprisingly there are only a few devices in the market to aid them, which can be hard on the pocket (5000$ - 10000$!!). These devices essentially just magnify the images and only help those with mild to moderate impairment. There is no product in circulation for those who are completely blind.

                <p>
                    The Third Eye brings a plethora of features at just 5% the cost. We set our minds to come up with a device that provides much more than just a sense of sight and most importantly is affordable to all. We see this product as an edge cutting technology for futuristic development of Assistive technologies.
