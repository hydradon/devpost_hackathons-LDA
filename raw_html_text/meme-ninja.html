                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group did not have a specific idea at the start, however, we were interested by the unique hardware available at the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game tracks the movement of the user's fingers and maps it onto the screen. If the line formed by the user hits an enemy/meme, the target is destroyed. If you miss a meme and it disappears, you lose a life. The completion of 3 levels results in a win while 5 lost life points causes a game over.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The leap motion senor acts as an interface to receive the user's hand gestures as input. The hand gesture required the user to touch their index and middle finger together while pointing outwards above the sensor. The average coordinates of the tips of these fingers act as an x,y coordinate where a circle/dot is drawn on the screen. This process is repeated every 17 miliseconds, so you can draw lines. We made it so that only ten dots could be drawn at the screen at a time; leaving a disappearing trail as you drew the lines. Next, using objects, a target class was implemented which creates different memes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, our group wanted to create a painting canvas with the leap motion. We felt that for an immersive experience, the oculus rift had to be in combination with the leap motion. However, none of our laptops were compatible with the oculus rift and we thus scraped the virtual reality aspect of our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of coming up with the clever solution to a tricky problem of creating a trailing line. Our progress was halted to a stop at one point, however, by using an array list, the line is constantly adding a new point and taking away the last. Furthermore, we are happy to say that an inexperienced team were able to develop and complete a complicated program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned how to program with the leap motion. Additionally, we were able to strengthen our skills with java objects and classes, specifically with 2D Graphics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Meme Ninja
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on polishing this game further by adding more levels and enemies.
