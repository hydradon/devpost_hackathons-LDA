                    CheckIn is an app which allows students to check into class and check in with their emotional and mental health. If a student requires assistance, they are directed to academic resources and are encouraged to get help. This app also enables teachers and instructors to keep track of the class attendance as well as get an indication of how their students feel. As a result, healthier relationships are fostered between students and faculty.
