                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As tutors at the University of Melbourne, we have found that students regularly struggle to initially understand fundamental programming concepts. Furthermore, existing solutions do not effectively cater to visual learners.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It teaches students what basic programming concepts like loops and branching mean, through visuals. The visual will be presented in one part of the screen, with code in another part. It will also feature challenges where users will be given a visual representation of a function and asked to reproduce the visual using code.

                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the platform using Node.js and Express. Additionally, we used the bootstrap CSS library for the front-end design as well as the p5.js library to render the code visually.

                    More concretely, adding extra exercises and features. A potential feature could be VR support for the widely available google cardboard. This would allow users to see more complicated visuals / diagrams, that are difficult / not possible to display on a 2d plane.
