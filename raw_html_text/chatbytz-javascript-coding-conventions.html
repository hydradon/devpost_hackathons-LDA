                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspiration which initiated me to develop this bot was to make an interactive-conversation to learn and improve JavaScript Coding Conventions. Usually beginners seek for guidance of a mentor/expert in the platform. In the absence of the mentor/expert, the other option would be the resource in internet where millions of information for a single platform are available. So as  to make  an interactive-conversation, the beginner shall interact with the Chat Bot, which helps him to improve the knowledge and also know the latest updates in the platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Chatbytz initially check the developer knowledge in JavaScript over a conversation and decides whether the user has a knowledge in ES5 or ES6. Based on the conversation the bot decides the knowledge of the user gained over the language. In the case, if the user has knowledge over ES5, then the conversation will start based on JavaScript ES5. On the other case,  the conversation will be based on JavaScript ES6. If the user is a beginner, then it will proceed with the JavaScript ES5. Further conversation with the bot will check the knowledge over the language and also teaches best practises to write better code.

                    The Conversation bot is created using

                    which is a simple JavaScript Framework to build Facebook Messenger's Chat bots. The Application has a built in Question/Answer and Scoring engine to find the Developers coding practices  as well as helping them to learn the best practices to Code in JavaScript.
