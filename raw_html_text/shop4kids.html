                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Food4Kids is an organization that provides elementary school students with limited access to food on the weekends. We went into DeltaHacks so we could learn about new technologies while contributing to an organization at the forefront of social innovation. Since Food4Kids aligned with our values, we went forward with it to put our efforts into creating something that will help some of the people who need it most in the local community.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app around the ASP .NET MVC framework and made use of Microsoft's Azure Cloud Services to host both the application and database. The icons were made in ClipStudio Paint and the payment mechanic makes use of the PayPal API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a few issues with the PayPal API, as this was the first time any of us had interacted with a payment mechanism. With a lot of trial and error, we managed to connect to the API and track purchases made through the application. We were presented with several other smaller challenges, such as ensuring the information on the application was consistent/correct.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're most proud of how we were able to host the app on a cloud platform (Azure). The complete integration of the PayPal mechanic into our project and the fluidity of our team workflow with the help of Slack and Git also proved useful in the completion of the project and our overall knowledge. We're proud of all that we learned and are pleased with the overall final design of the application.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about new technology stacks (Azure, PayPal, .Net Core, MVC) as well as database administration.

                <p>
                    Open source the code to allow for other developers to learn from our experiences as well as to wrap up the web application, squashing all bugs and allowing for full commercial use.
