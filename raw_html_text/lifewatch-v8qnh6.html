                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's hard to be ready and save a drowning swimmer. My close friend Rudi remembers the day his coworker lost their lives. After his shift, the next lifeguard-on duty responded to a drowning swimmer but neither the lifeguard nor swimmer survived. It's difficult to save a panicking person where plenty can go wrong so It's crucial to prepare.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LifeWatch helps lifeguards practice their skills and hone their knowledge without the cost of dangerous and costly tests or real-world experiences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LifeWatch was built in 30hours by 3 UCSD students learning C# and Unity for the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we encountered was getting started with a new development environment. Unity has a comprehensive framework linking scripts to dialogue boxes, but is often overwhelming. Learning this environment took our team roughly 50% of the entire hackathon. The second largest challenge was working with a brand new, undocumented, SteamVR api. Not only were all tutorials online outdated, even the vr mentors at SD hacks were unfamiliar with the new api. Minor challenges arose from our team without a CS student being unfamiliar with best object oriented programming practices. Our code could use more work D':

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alec, Sayan, and Howard are most proud of the immersive product with dynamic water, realistic models, and rich sound.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The three of us learned that Hackathons are about connecting with like-minded students and they are about demonstrating an ability to plan and deliver.

                    What's next for LifeWatch

                <p>
                    The release of LifeWatch2 with awesome new features including rescuing a person while in the water and performing CPR.
