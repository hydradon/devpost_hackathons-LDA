                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did a survey in India and found the majority of the population is yet to hear or experience Bitcoin or Cryptocurrency. Upon discovery, we found that a ) many have not tried it because there is a belief that Bitcoin has to be owned as a whole which is expensive today. b) buying Crypto is still an inconvenient experience as it deals with complex tech and riskier to lose funds. To address this we have created CryptoAlly.io on the lightning network where people can buy Bitcoin as low as 1 dollar or 1 rupee. By these people experience Bitcoin for the first time without spending much. We believe crypto adoption can be driven through CryptoAlly.io as it is a low-risk experiment for people in terms of value and can get the full experience of how to be part of this economy and technology. CryptoAlly.io would like to be the go-to app for first-time users.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Idea is to enable buying Bitcoin as low as 1 dollar or 1 rupee. Today, you can discover prices of Bitcoin or Satoshis in 100+ currencies in real time and you can claim 200 free satoshis as part of the launch. Payment integration is pending for completion.

                <p>
                    Crypto line of businesses doesn't get banking or payment gateway support in India and many countries. This resulted in a pending fiat payment integration.
