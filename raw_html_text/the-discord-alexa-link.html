                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a skill with Amazon Alexa that would both aid users and help them communicate with others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can trigger a skill on Alexa, which will allow you to send a message into a Discord channel.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with the help of the Amazon Alexa SDK and Python 3.6. We also used VSCode and Discord as helpful software as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were a lot of bugs, including a bug where Alexa wouldn't register our response as a command.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It took one of us three hours to sort out the biggest bug in the program. We also used some of Alexa's machine learning algorithms to register most sentences into a valid collection.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot more about Python and how to make skills for the Amazon Alexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Discord-Alexa Link
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It will notify the user upon the mentioning of their account.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Demo Information
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, the Alexa Skill is not publicly available on the Amazon Alexa skill marketplace. However, a live demo can be seen at our location, which is to the closest right of the big screen and down two rows on the edge closest to the center aisle.
