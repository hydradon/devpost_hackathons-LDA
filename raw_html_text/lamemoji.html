                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project detects faces in a live video feed and from there overlays an emoji that best corresponds to their emotions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed this program with OpenCV and the Keras API. With OpenCV we extrapolate faces within an image and use the keras model to predict the expression of the faces. With that information we overlay the corresponding emoji onto the video frame.
We also introduced multiple threads, the main thread is responsible for image manipulation, while another is solely responsible for grabbing images from the live feed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into the issue of detecting false positives during face detection process.
