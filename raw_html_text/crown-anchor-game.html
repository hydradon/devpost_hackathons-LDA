                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am fairly new to programming and began learning Python 3 months ago. I learned the basics of lists, loops, parameters, etc, but had never integrated this all into one program. I've been meaning to do this but never had the time/focus to dedicate myself to starting/finishing a project of this scale. While the focus of the game doesn't fall under the categories for YHack, I wanted to build a simple program (preferably a game since they're fun) that would combine everything I've learned about Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program allows the user to play the card game, Crown and Anchors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of trouble passing parameters and getting the program to continuously run.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing it!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Where is it?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've copied and pasted the code below, sorry if this is sketchy, I just don't want to put it on my GitHub yet!
