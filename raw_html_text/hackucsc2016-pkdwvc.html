                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> California is in a water crisis. Citizens are taking measures to reduce their water footprints by not washing their cars, taking fewer showers, even trying not to flush toilets. Domestic use of water accounts for only 20 percent of California's overall water use while agriculture is responsible for the other 80. If Californians want to make a difference when it comes to water consumption, a much more effective measure would be to reduce the demand for food products that use more water. A hamburger takes 660 gallons of water to produce. You'd have to skip showers for 2 months to save the same amount of water as skipping one hamburger.

    waterCode empowers consumers to make drought-conscious decisions when purchasing food at a grocery store. it's an Android app that scans barcodes to analyze the ingredients used in a particular product and then shows the user a graded scale for how water conscientious it is. An F is the worst choice and an A is considered very good. It also has features for helping users track their water usage.

 waterCode is developed in Android Studio. It uses API's provided by the Zebra Crossing project (ZXing) for the barcode scanner and links to an online database provided by openfoodfacts.org.

                    Almost every single detail of this project was a challenge. No one in our team has any experience with Android programming or has ever used Android Studio.

                    Almost every single detail is an accomplishment I'm proud of, for aforementioned reasons.
