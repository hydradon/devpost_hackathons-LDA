                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is always hard for people to keep track and manage their money in a timely and intelligent fashion. This app makes it convenient for bank users to estimate how much extra money they can spend without overspending.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By directly accessing the user's bank account balances, and keeping track of the user's weekly income and expenditures, as well as estimating the amount of money put aside for various savings accounts, it can project what their future disposable incomes are for the upcoming week.
