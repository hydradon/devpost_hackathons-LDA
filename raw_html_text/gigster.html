                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired to make Gigster because as a musician myself, it is very difficult to find other musicians near me, especially since I'm a high school student. I wanted to make it easier for musicians in similar situations to be able to find and meet musicians who have a similar taste in music near them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The goal of the app is to make musicians able to meet other musicians nearby, with similar music interests and skill levels, and form groups to perform together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have not yet finished Gigster and I have to add on some features, but I used swift in Xcode.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I find it difficult to find distances between users after they enter their ZipCode. I plan on finding an API to do this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I proud that I was able to build an app from barely nothing. I had no Swift experience before this, so I'm very proud of the fact that I was able to gain a basic understanding of the language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that I need to manage my time better. Next time, I want to make a more detailed plan and stick to it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Gigster
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully soon I'll be able to ship a usable product to the App Store.
