                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What we do: We make you look cool in front of all your friends after you lost that one bet, because now you can gesture your way to the amount you need to venmo. Lose with style and grace.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes peer-to-peer, MyoKit, and Venmo requests and puts them all together to detect a nearby phone on the same network thats using the PayItForward app, use gestures to change the dollar amount, and double tap to submit payment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used iphone peer-to-peer connectivity to find nearby venmo users. Then integrated the MyoKit, so we could recognize different hand gestures to increment and decrement amount payed. User confirmed payment by double tapping their fingers and we used the venmo api to ensure it went thought. Also blood, sweat, and tears.
