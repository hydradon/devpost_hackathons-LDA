                    Due to hectic work schedule and unpredictable working hours, while working as a Software Engineer, I was losing health, immunity and gaining weight.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Two months ago, I realized that if I approach health not as a science, but as a math. I can control my eating and make sure to stay in good shape. It's all about the calorie count. Micheal Phelps eats more than 10000 calories a day but loses the same or more amount by extreme workout schedule.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since we all can not have the lifestyle of Micheal Phelps, this app can help you to keep your daily calorie in check by using location based search and healthy food recommendations for any restaurant at the current location. App also has community feature where you can see healthy food recommendation from any other users or trusted editors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you start the app, it uses your mobile geolocation and lists all the restaurants for the current location. On click or search results, you get all the healthy food options for selected restaurant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gone are the days of being confused while ordering food and eating wrong food due to less awareness. This app has editor's choice and user-based recommendations to help you get the best of each restaurant and best of your health. You can personalize your recommendation based on your expected daily calorie diet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We all have that list, let's share it and help our community be healthy and happy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's eat smart, moderate, stay healthy and fight obesity.
