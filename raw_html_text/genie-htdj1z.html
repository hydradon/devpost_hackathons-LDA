                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are loads of awesome services out there that makes everyone life easier, what if all those services actually communicated with humans in a natural immersive way?
                </p>
                <p>
                    That was what motivated us to build Genie, Genie is a messaging app that talk with

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows you to chat with various services at the same time, 
Are you looking for a trip to a safe country with cheapest possible route? then start a group chat with Skyscanner and Blackrock and let them take care of everything for you. 
Do you want to tweet and facebook at the same time? then message facebook and twitter!
Send a picture to Clarifai and let Clarifai figure out the tags in the pictures. 
Do you want to turn on the music on your laptop? then message your laptop with that command.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With natural language processing all those conversation will flow naturally and immerse you in a world where the line between virtual and reality is paper thin.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using node.js we host a server that integrate the aforementioned APIs, we built a native iOS interface that aimed to be simple as possible
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating all the APIs under one platform
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have managed to achieve everything we set out at the beginning of the hackathon to do and learnt a lot on the way.
                </p>

                    What's next for Genie
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating more services, ensure a better scalable server (potentially moving to AWS), fixing bugs and refactor the hackathon code later.
