                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As part of our commitment to creating a more inclusive future, we worked with TD Da-Vinci API to create a TD Advisor app that enables users to get advice on their day-to-day finances and get matched with a nearest TD branch financial advisor if users need in-depth information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TD Advisor is an android app which helps the user manage their financial portfolio. It advises the user with
                    <strong>
                        Financial, Mortgage and Investment
                    </strong>
                    opportunities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app makes use of TD's open-source Da Vinci API to fetch information about a realistic-user. It uses that data to see their financial activities and provides them information on what they can improve on. It even advises them to go see their local advisor to get on track with worry-free economic life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app also provides the user with relevant information about how much mortgage loan they are eligible to take based on their income and current financial status. This allows the user to have a ball-park idea of what range of houses they can afford. Addition to this, the app provides useful info and links to trading opportunities that may increase their needs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an Android app. We used an Android Studio IDE and TD Da Vinci API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our algorithms require a large number of data to process accurate information about the user. Some of the things are not provided in the TD Da Vinci API, for example, Credit Score of the user. As a result of this, we had to come with a different way of analyzing our calculations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A functioning demo that successfully makes use of TD's Da Vinci API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about how to handle large real-world financial data. Big data filtering and processing was done to get the desired result.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TD Advisor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating information about the nearest branch and real advisors information. We want to be able to provide a service that enables the user to get the financial help they need at ease. This may involve sending a text/ notification if their financial activity is causing a dent in their credit score.
