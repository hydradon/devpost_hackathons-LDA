                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I got inspired to create this app because of what I had seen other developers make on the App Store. It is seriously amazing how such great technology and knowledge people use to create apps. I personally got this idea because I used to be late to school many times because of my sister, and I felt that there was no way to stop this from happening. I then thought that making an app that would let you share alarms with others would definitely help in me not being late anymore.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My app allows users to share alarms with whomever is making them late. It could also be used to share alarms with people you would be carpooling with, meeting with, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Firebase to upload values to the database and read these values when needed. Firebase also allowed me to create users and share alarms with others over the air. I used the language "Swift" to develop my app along with the program Xcode.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into many challenges. Many of them being related to Firebase.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud to have created a sharing app that I use with Firebase.

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    I learned how to develop apps in Swift and Firebase.

                    What's next for GroupAlarm - Share alarms with others
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will be including a variation of sounds, and creating groups to send invites to via GroupAlarm. Right now I have my MVP released, but I plan to include many features in the future.
