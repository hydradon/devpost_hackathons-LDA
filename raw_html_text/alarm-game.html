                    Elevator Pitch: Wake up your brain by playing the game

                <p>
                    Story: While we scrambled to find an idea, we decided to do a project using hardware with the Arduino. This project is dedicated to those times we turn off the alarm only to fall asleep right after and miss the dreaded 9am lecture.This works by extracting the time using a computer system (unfortunately, we didn't have access to a RTC clock). When the time hits the time specified by the user, it begins to beep, shine an LED and a game is launched on the 8x8 matrix. This game is a basic space invaders game where the user has to kill 10 enemies for the ringing to finally stop. By forcing the user to focus and concentrate, they will end up more awake by the time they complete the game than if they just mindlessly had to hit a button.Despite the simple premise, we had a few issues such as reading the input from the hardware, with so many wires, it can get quite convoluted so having the pins set up correctly can take up a sizeable amount of time debugging. Furthermore, combining our code has led to many compile and run-time errors, to fix this, it would've been much better if we had used Git so we could contribute on each of our machines.In the future, it would be much nicer if it had a variety of games. Due to the way we wrote the code, we allowed for more games to very easily be implemented, so it would be much more fun if there was a variety of games. Also, it'd probably be more convenient if the alarm clock had a casing, since its large breadboard can take up a pick of space and the joystick is loose.Overall, this was a great experience for us as a team since this is our first time here. We would love to come next time and try out some other challenges.
