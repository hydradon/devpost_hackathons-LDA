                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a huge issue in society where people who are speech impaired (7 million in the US alone) aren't able to communicate effectively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BrainScan gives speech impaired people a voice by converting their brain waves into audible speech.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Hardware and Data Processing -- Used the Muse BrainSensing Headset to read brainwaves.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Neural Networks -- Used the python keras library to convert brainwaves into readable text.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Amazon Web Services -- Used AWS to create an Alexa skill that read out the readable text.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We only had 1000 data points, which was not enough to effectively train our neural network model on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got our validation accuracy of the number classification 5% over the baseline.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Amazon Web Services, specifically about Lambda Functions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BrainScan
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to implement the three step process with synchronous communication and have an instantaneous feedback loop.
