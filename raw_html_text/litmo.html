                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were in ECHA at uAlberta and we found out that we couldn't make a game. So we were like "Yo Leap motion in a car!".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows the user to run automated tasks in a vehicle's infotainment functions with gestures allowing the users to focus on the road.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were like yo, leap motion. We need to connect it to a phone. First we explored direct connection with an android phone. However, with a lack of public sdk privileges, we had to explore another means of communicating gesture data with an android phone. Our solution was to route the data through the cloud enabling communication with the device.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Reliably accurate gesture identification and server optimization.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided on a project and followed it through without hesitation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the fundamentals of group collaboration and splitting up the work in a coding project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Gest
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are going to transition from the cloud and establish a direct hardware link to enable a more reliable and streamlined experience.
