                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was the fact that finance is becoming increasingly relevant in today's society, especially for college bound teens and grad students, who oftentimes struggle to effectively manage their money.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app with the knowledge that there are countless other budgeting apps already in use, however our app offers an adorable incentive- a pig!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started building our app in two groups with one group tackling the cute pig visuals and the other group writing code to work with the visuals. The group handling the pig visuals, the graphics group, comprised of members that were extremely familiar with Photoshop and InDesign and were able to produce our fun pig graphics! The group handling the code to implement the visuals comprised of members that were familiar with java and javafx in Eclipse and were able to produce the GUI for the app.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As the coding team, we actually ran into a couple of issues that were primarily because we didn't have the right software to begin developing android apps. We started coding on Eclipse, which actually no longer supports Android app development, so we had to save the portions of code that was still (app)licable to the Android app (pun 100% intended). By the time we had downloaded Android Studio (in which we could still use Java, the language that we are most familar with), we had lost a significant amount of time. Since it was our first time using Android Studio, we spent a large portion of our time just trying to understand how Android Studio works, so overall we felt really short on time.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The pig visuals, in our opinion, are really cute and we're very proud of them! We're also pleased with our GUI, which we were able to produce from scratch after having installed the program for the first time today.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot more about using Photoshop and inDesign in terms of visuals, and about developing android apps on Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Budget Pig
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We weren't able to get our app running to the extent at which we had originally planned, and thus weren't able to run some of the features that we really wanted to incorporate. Fortunately, we were able to gain a lot of experience through this hackathon, and this is definitely not the last you will hear of Budget Pig!
