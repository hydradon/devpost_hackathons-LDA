                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On my birthday I got an echo plus as a gift from my parents. I started learning about Alexa and I was excited to figure out that I could add skills. While reading and researching Alexa I stumbled upon this hackathon 6 weeks after the starting. While I had only a few days to build a skill I successfully built a simple skill. I am very happy that I had this opportunity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The skill I built is a math game that kids can play using Alexa to learn addition and to enjoy interacting with Alexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the programming language Python. I used the Flask library and the flask-ask library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the challenges I ran into was a problem with a loop in my program to make Alexa ask 5 math questions and give the score at the end in addition to offering the player to play another round.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of the fact that I was able to build a skill in such a short time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to build a simple Alexa skill using Python. (my favorite language)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Addition Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will definitely continue developing the Addition Game until I make sure it is ready to be enabled for Alexa production.
