                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Illness is a constant threat to our bodies, often debilitating us and hindering our ability to perform daily activities. Online solutions such as WebMD serve as one way of relieving our symptoms, however, can be very inconviencintntinnt at times, especially when ill. Incorporating a program such as this in an easy to use device like an Alexa can make this process easy.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Symptoms are inputted by the user and then are evaluated by a symptoms API. The diagnosis is then reported to the user by the Alexa.

                    ## How I built it
Using AWS and Amazon developer with Python, we coded this.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble maintaining sanity in the early hours of the morning. In addition, we had trouble interpreting the templates provided by amazon. We had some syntax and logic problems which we could barely overcome.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to make a skill on an Alexa.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Amazon has a very bad user interface. In addition we increased our knowledge in python and now can effectively and easily create a basic skill and interpret amazon template code.

                <p>
                    We plan to add more symptoms and add more variables such as gender  and age
