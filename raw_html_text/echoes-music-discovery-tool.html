                    Echoes uses the Spotify API to analyze the Audio Features (details like key, loudness, tempo, speechiness and liveness) of the user's favorite Track. It creates a List of 20 Songs that are very similar to the user's favorite Song.
The user can save it as a Playlist for later or watch the YouTube Videos of the tracks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the APIs of Spotify and YouTube to build it. My main tools were PHP to get and post data to the APIs and HTML and CSS to display it. 
It's mainly based on the the Audio Features Endpoint and on the Personalization Endpoint of the Spotify API.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Music Hack Day was my first Hackathon and it was a great experience. 
I learned how to use the Analytics Data from Spotify and I will definitely use their API in some of my next projects.

                    What's next for Echoes - Music Discovery Tool
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Let's see what the people think about it. I saw some hardware projects at this hackathon and maybe I can turn this into a physical Radio that plays only the stuff that I like.
