                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Legal conflicts are often expensive to resolve. Arbitrations typically cost about 2000$, while court trials can cost from 20,000$ to millions. Marginalized smaller entities often have more difficulty in affording legal protection.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Juretheum is an arbitration method that provides an affordable alternative to solve legal conflicts. It is intended to solve legal conflicts that can be decided based on people's common knowledge of things. It allows the two parties/multiple parties of the conflict to upload evidence and tell their stories, so that ordinary people can act as jury for them, which saves time, energy and cost for everyone. Voters can choose to open or not open their votes when their voting period ends. They are encouraged to open their vote by giving back a percentage of their contribution to the pool when they voted. If their opened votes are on the majority side, then they receive a payoff that awards them for making a judgment that is consistent with common sense.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Juretheum based on Ethereum smart contract technologies
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges into implementing our design. We ran into bugs in our codes that took way too long to solve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the innovative design of this arbitration system that utilizes the benefits of blockchain technology, which makes collusion or corruption less likely to happen, and reduces the cost of protecting people's rights.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to write solidity. How to think about anti-collusion mechanisms in designing an arbitration system.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Juretheum
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Juretheum could possibly become a viable alternative to solving legal conflicts without cumbersome and costly arbitration/court procedures. Currently, our design of the system includes only binary result. However, in the future we hope to develop methods to reach more detailed arbitration results.
