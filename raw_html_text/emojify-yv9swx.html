                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project inspired me by the vast use of emojis in today's era. Most reactions are made with emojis and this project emphasizes on that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Emojify takes text as an input and converts the meaningful keywords to emoji characters
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I stored the emoji's characteristics in objects. With these objects I was able to compare the inputted words to synonyms/actual word of the emoji. I used javascript to bring the interactivity to the user. To show the emojis, I used a css library which contained the emoji pictures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Emojis didn't play nicely on a browser. Emojis reference to unicode, and I was not able to make that direct conversion. Instead, I referenced to pictures. I never messed with JSON files, and I struggled for a bit on how to convert it to an object.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned way more about objects than I thought I could learn, and how css libraries work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to work with JSON files, and how they are imported.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Emojify
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully I can publish this online!
