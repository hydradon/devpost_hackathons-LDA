                    Inspiration

                <p>
                    We all wanted to do a health-related hack that we could focus on hardware with while still doing some coding. From that we came up will

                <p>
                    Pill Buddy is a pill dispenser that will dispense the correct medication at a set time. Pill Buddy is bio-metrically locked so that only the intended recipient of the medicine will take the medication dispensed. The bio-metrics can also be used to keep the box locked for everyone except the doctor and other authorized people. This mechanism is important because it helps get rid of mistakes like mixing up medications and also helps keep more at-risk individuals for drug abuse from taking too much medication and possibly over-dosing.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we had such time constraints, our dispenser is built from cardboard. We used cardboard for the main body and then used hardware components for the actual working mechanisms. We used an Arduino 101, a micro servo, a fingerprint scanner, and a digital display as our main components.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge that we ran into was finding the right components to interface with each other. The MLH Hardware Lab had a big mix of components, some of which only work with specific boards. We had to change out our components a lot throughout the day and night.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being here at Technica and building something. Two of our teammates are new to hackathons since its their first time ever and they just wanted to get in the spirit of it and learn some new stuff. That is exactly what we all did and we couldn't be more proud of that.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that you can build things out of very little material and what you can find laying around.

                    What's next for Pill Buddy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for Pill Buddy is to make a software that works hand-in-hand with the dispensing unit so that the doctors, caregivers, and patients can have their own portals to view their medications on and adjust the dispensing schedule.
