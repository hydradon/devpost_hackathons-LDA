                    <strong>
                        The Golden MacGuffin was born out out of a love for all things science fiction, fantasy, and adventure that I read as a child. The wonder and magic I experienced is something that I would love to give back to kids (and possibly all audiences) through this project.

                    <strong>
                        The skill allows the intrepid adventurer following along with TeyShawn to choose what adventures will take place depending on the choices that they make. There are 96 nodes or scenes, and plenty of different surprise endings, as well as narrative loops.

                    <strong>
                        After deciding on a concept, I started my research on GitHub and discovered the

                        created by Amazon engineer Thomas Yuill and uploaded by Amazon engineer Robert Jamison. As someone who is new to the world of coding, this tool really gave me the impetus I needed to be intrepid and explore my creative abilities and coding skills.

                    <strong>
                        While the tool was tremendously helpful, I wound up having to break out of the node.js kit provided in order to customize the project to my own ends. Narrative looping was especially difficult for me. Figuring out how to re-use intents within nodes proved quite the challenge, but it was worth it!
