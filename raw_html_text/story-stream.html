                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We strongly believe in a quote that says, &ldquo;great story happens to those who can tell them&rdquo; (by Ira Glass). So Story Stream will allow all voice-based-creators to upload, and users to stream their content.  Currently, professional storytellers/voice actors/ including some radio celebs narrate stories (by w/ great voice acting and bg effects) to create an immersive audio story content for listeners. These creators are publishing their &lsquo;audio-heavy&rsquo; work on YouTube and have over a million subscribers that love the content.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Story Stream allows listeners to stream immersive stories and audio dramas on their Amazon Alexa enabled devices such as Echo devices, and Smart headphones &amp; speakers like Bose QC 35 and Sonos One etc
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started off by reaching out these narrators on YouTube and talking to them (sometime in July 2018).  We built out back-end on AWS parallelly.  Our entire skill is build manually using ASK CLI and developer account interfaces.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During the beta (in Aug 2018), a lot of users had told they hhad difficulty invoking with the skill because of the invocation name 'Oyku Stories' [Oyku being a non-english word, btw, which means 'a story' in Turkish :)]. But thankfully we hadn't submitted the skill for certification and we were able to change the invocation name to 'Story Stream' after th beta

                    <li>
                        Three (3) top narrators from YouTube are onboard this project and are uploading their content on our platform
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We got covered by Alexa Skill Review podcast on their Thanks giving episode

                    <li>
                        We got picked up in another episode of Voiceity podcast where Nick and Seth discuss 'how cool Story Stream skill is'
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We got interviewed on our journey and how we built the skill on voiciety podcast on the 30th of Dec

                    <li>
                        For lot our users, Story stream has become a bedtime routine!  And share feedback that reads 'I love this and I can't wait to see it futher developed', "I'm 30, Single female, Story stream someone narrates a story while I fall asleep everyday'

                    <li>
                        A lot of things. Especially it's been challengin and fun to design voice experiences.

                    <li>
                        Keeping thins unscalable/manual allows you to learn and adapt faster, even though it kills you in the process ;)  But hey, it could be because both of us have full-time jobs and are building this simultaneously.
