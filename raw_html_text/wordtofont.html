                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The right font is hard to find, especially when you know little about typefaces and fonts.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This website crowd-sources adjectives and words to be associated with fonts.  In turn, users can search abstract words, moods, thoughts, or adjectives to find the right font.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used ruby-on-rails to maintain the backend and handled the front-end and UI with Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Prior to this, I had hardly ever programmed in Javascript and I had never set up a rails server with API's.  So, the hardest part was just figuring out how to connect all the parts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works.  I just can't believe it works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a much deeper understanding of how to develop ruby-on-rails applications and I got great experience in programming user experiences in html, css, and javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WordToFont
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hope to significantly expand the database with many more word-font associations and many more fonts.  Then I hope to add some more complex algorithms to proactively label fonts.
