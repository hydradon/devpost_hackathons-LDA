                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've always a wanted a simple, easy to use desktop app for monitoring prices of items that I plan to purchase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Want helps users save money by monitoring Walmart.com online pricing for saved items and sending notifications when prices drop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With Visual Studio 2015 and lots of C# and XAML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had lots of trouble with some UI stuff as well as the Windows.Storage APIs, but I was able to get all of my issues worked out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integration with the Walmart API and the relatively good design for the time I had to work on it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There isn't much documentation out there for Windows 10 apps (yet).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Want
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'd like to add a bit more polish and make this a production app very soon. I'm thinking about integrating with other services as well.
                </p>
