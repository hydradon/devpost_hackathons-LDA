                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The current situation of our environment inspired us to create an interactive website and IOS app to help people realize just how severe climate change is affecting our lives and future of society.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Eco Mode website informs the user about global climate change and why it is important to take immediate action. It includes an interactive globe that tells the user if a specific regions climate is currently stable or not.
The Eco Mode IOS app allows the user to create an account that they can use to find or create economically friendly events around them. It also includes an "Ecofy Me" feature that lets the user set reminders to make being economically friendly easier to remember, and a News tab to keep up to date with local weather and environment news.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Thimble and Glitch with html and javascript to build the Eco Mode website and its features. We also used Xcode in Swift to attempt to create the app, and used MarvelApp to prototype the end result of the Eco Mode app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The interactive map and banner were the biggest challenges we faced while creating the html website. The app in general was very difficult to create in Swift considering that I only have experience with Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the idea we created and how the end result of our website and app prototype turned out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to code in Swift, while my team members learned more about javascript and html.
                </p>
