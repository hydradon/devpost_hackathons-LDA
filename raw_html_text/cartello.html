                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the Martello challenge to use radio telemetry to identify if a wireless connection is sufficient or a a new connection is needed, thus being able to make better travelling decisions. We were also inspired by the new developments in AR technology to incorporate AR elements in our data visualization.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use AR to visualize how your algorithm will pick a network for your car to connect to.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We an wrote ingestion script to consume Martello's data , a script to allow for real-time simulation of data,  framework allows for flexible definitions of algorithms to fit customers need and then used ARKit to visualize car travel and connection in simulated real-time.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulties rendering the map, creating the environment within the camera space and anchoring down the path.

                    We are brand-new to AR, we're proud of our camera space and front-end
