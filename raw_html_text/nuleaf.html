                </h2>
                <p>
                    Twitter shows that words can be extremely impactful. In a mere 140 characters, a person's self esteem can be crushed. These harassers may not be aware of the impact of their words. We want to draw awareness to this impact, so these harassers will reconsider sending these types of tweets out.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We constantly scout for tweets harassing people. Once we have found the tweet, we return a quote that allows them to reflect on their hurtful words.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're using Twitter's API in order to gather tweets that contain harassing words toward other people. We feed these tweets into the IBM Watson's Alchemy API which allows us to analyze the emotion of the text. After confirming that the tweet is considered harassment, we use Twitter's API to retweet the harasser with a quote that allows them to reflect on their hurtful impact.
