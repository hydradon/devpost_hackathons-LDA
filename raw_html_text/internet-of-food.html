                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I excited about the Internet of Things.  I wanted to make an Internet of Food.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We connect a wire a cup, utensil, or food.  All of these are conductive.  We attach a wire to the person so are ground.  When the food touches a person's lips, the computer records that a bite has been taken.  Nutritional value is looked up and displayed.  This system helps a person keep a balanced diet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about pull-up resistors and implemented a moving window averager.

                    What's next for Internet Of Food
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keep logs of what what you eat and recommend food for a balanced diet.
