                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every year, grocery stores throw out forty-three billion pounds of food, amounting to 9.7% of vegetables and 11.4% of fruit lost.  In the city of Chicago alone, there are 600,000 people who do not have access to fresh food and live in "food deserts".  We seek to alleviate this problem by re-purposing food that would be thrown out and bringing it at a low cost to the food deserts.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Oasis unities communities that have a need for fresh food and grocery stores that have a surplus and organizes shipments between the two areas.  Weekly shipments would be coordinated and optimized through the website and then individuals in communities would be able to purchase produce at a low cost.  Oasis strives to benefit both groups by becoming the middleman between them.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this website with html and css, and used phpMyAdmin for the database.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a hard time creating posts within the website and then relating location to shipment choices.  Operating with a small team (2) was our downfall.
