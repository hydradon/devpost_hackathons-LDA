                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are many data collection tools but there are few data collection tools that use Chatbots as a channel. Many people now have access to a smart phone that could be used to collect data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mobile Data Collection, Aggregation and Analytics software that enables you to design simple forms and collect data via either Slack Chatbot, Telegram Chatbot, Facebook Messenger Chatbot and SMS. The data collected is instantly uploaded to a central server that can be downloaded into different format such as excel and pdf and geospatially analysed on Google Maps. The data can also be automatically emailed to a recipient or sent to a 3rd party system by calling an its API.  We support collection of text, integer, decimal, radio button (single select), photos, videos, gps co-ordinates and mobile money. We are also the first chatbot worldwide to support collection of mobile money payments as a question type.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I did R&amp;D and first designed a form builder that could enable one to easier design a form. Then, I integrated with the external chatbot API's to send and receive data. An active form being filled is saved in a session. I build an intelligent algorithm to know the current question, perform on the fly question validation and return a list for multiple question.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, Natural Language Processing (NPL) questions are sent to API.AI and the results are returned to the user after we hit an intent.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Integrating to external API and NPL API's. It was a learning experience where I improve my skills of better design, development and consumption of RESTful API. Also, interacting with NPL educated my on Intents, Agents and Entities
