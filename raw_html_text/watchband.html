                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In a word, Apple is dope. From Apple Watches to the Apple TV to our iPhones, we've used a variety of their products and can confirm that they're all awesome! This hackathon, we thought it would be a cool idea to integrate all the above into one immersive and fluid app to share our excitement!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WatchBand is a musical adventure through Apple's wearable and product ecosystem. Using Apple Watches, users can strum, drum, and saxophone to the beat of their favorite tunes. With real-time motion tracking of both the Apple Watch and Siri remote, users are truly in control of the musical experience at their fingertips. You have the option of choosing songs from multiple genres.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>

                <p>
                    But also a very intensive Swift-heavy development process involving both tvOS and watchOS2 integrated into a seamless, all-in-one application with watch-to-iPhone and iPhone-to-tvOS interconnectivity.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    75% of our team had barely used Swift prior to this hackathon. We're so happy to be here, at the end of the day, demoing a fully-fledged multipurpose application that we're all really proud of!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first time we ventured into and successfully integrated watchOS2. We also were able to implement features from the accelerometers of both the Apple Watch and Siri remote.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WatchBand
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is our team's mission to always shoot for bigger and better, even when we think we've put all we've got into our app. We want to ship WatchBand in the near future and make this a reality for users across the Apple ecosphere, reviving the air guitar trend that once swept the world!
