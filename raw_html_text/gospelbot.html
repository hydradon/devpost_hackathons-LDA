                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AI and virtual assistants (Siri, Google Now, Amazon Echo) have begun to infiltrate every smart device that we own. People enjoy casually interacting with them and getting them to automate tasks. We think that by riding on this wave, we will also be able to reach into the lives and share gospel truths with anyone who owns a smart device.

                    We used the LUIS, the Microsoft Bot Framework on Node.JS, and Azure to host the bot in the cloud.

                    <li>
                        Building bots and leveraging computer intelligence today is relatively easy, this project has shown a ton of potential in the short time that we started working on it, there are so many more possibilities that could be opened if we took this forward.
