                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to control things with simple gestures could be crucial to helping people with physical motor skill disabilities to be able to perform everyday tasks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The code takes in the myo data and according to which position your hand i in the robot will drive forward, backward, left or right.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used an arduino connected to 2 servo motors that were then connected to two wheels on the robot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had a lot of problems with having the right resources for motors which hindered my progress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the myo armband was super fun!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to talk to the Myo through the arduino.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Myo Gesture Controlled Robot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to develop the robot more with better motors. My initial plan was to have 2 dc motors with an Hbridge motor driver. Also, some additional sensors could include a wall sensor, and an image processing sensor for facial or object recognition.
