                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Emotions are powerful, and we wanted to see if we can harness the power of emotions to generate music.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mews detects and composes music according to your mood, while providing a cute visualisation of the music.

                    How we built it

                        Magenta.js
                    </a>
                    to generate music using seeds from various MIDIs. Microsoft Azure's

                        Emotion API
                    </a>
                    was used to detect the emotion of the user. Some experimentation was used to generate music that corresponded to certain moods. Bongocat was brought to life using some CSS and Javascript.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting Magenta to generate music that sounds decently nice required quite a lot of experimentation.

                    Making a nice little application that can bring some cuteness to people.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    How to use the Magenta.js library. Music is difficult to compose even for machines.
