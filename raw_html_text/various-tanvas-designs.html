                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After playing with the Tanvas demo we became inspired by the potential in this innovative technology. We decided to spend the rest of our time at MLH Prime brainstorming fun and innovative ways to use Tanvas. We did not have enough time to implement some of the many ideas we came up with, but chose the best of the few. We decided we wanted to see more games featuring this technology which lead us to creating Haptic Labyrinth. Some of the ideas that we were not able to include in this submission are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        An application which contains several musical instruments such as a guitar, where the strings would provide a haptic sensation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Haptic passwords/login where certain areas with the haptics to be touched in order to unlock the device.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Haptic Labyrinth is a creatively innovative way to experience Tanvas. Haptic Labyrithn is an dark maze of sorts with objectives that must be completed in order to advance to the next level of the labyrinth. The player will begin at the entrance to the labyrinth and without any visual aids, and must navigate through the maze only using sense of touch. The haptic walls generate a rough sensation which will be very noticeable to the player. As the player navigates throughout the maze, they must find a key to unlock the objective gate which blocks the exit to the next labyrinth. In case the player misses the key, and runs into the haptic gate first, there is a special haptic feel unique to gates. Keys will become visual when they are within a small range of the player. To provide some sense of direction to the player, we included a temporary path and visual steps where the player previously moved.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of the time was spent coming up with ideas to devote our time to creating the application. We also ran into issues with wifi/internet access being very sluggish so we decided to communicate our ideas on paper.
