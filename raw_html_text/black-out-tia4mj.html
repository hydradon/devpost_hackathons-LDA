                <h2>
                    Inspiration came from my friend mentioning how veterans often time suffer from ptsd
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does? It searches the entire page and censors key words and blacks out what is detected
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it? We used javascript and built off some source code we found online about scraping data and just a lot of tutorials on youtube
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into? Neither me nor my partner know Javascript but managed to put together from our limited knowledge which we managed to get to our MVP. We also tried to include data storage to allow users to put in their desired keywords but we were unable to finish the extra challenge we imposed onto ourselves.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of? We are proud of being able to allow on and off feature for premade words however the feature itself is buggy which was added ontop of our MVP.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned? We learned that we don't need to know the full understanding of a language to crate something with it.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Black out? We plan to implement user options for words which can be toggled on and off.
