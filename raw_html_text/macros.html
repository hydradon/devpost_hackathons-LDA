                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unhealthy diet is the leading cause of death in the U.S., contributing to approximately 678,000 deaths each year, due to nutrition and obesity-related diseases, such as heart disease, cancer, and type 2 diabetes. Let that sink in; the leading cause of death in the U.S. could be completely nullified if only more people cared to monitor their daily nutrition and made better decisions as a result. But
                    <strong>
                        who
                    </strong>
                    has the time to meticulously track every thing they eat down to the individual almond, figure out how much sugar, dietary fiber, and cholesterol is really in their meals, and of course, keep track of their macros! In addition, how would somebody with accessibility problems, say blindness for example, even go about using an existing app to track their intake? Wouldn't it be amazing to be able to get the full nutritional breakdown of a meal consisting of a cup of grapes, 12 almonds, 5 peanuts, 46 grams of white rice, 250 mL of milk, a glass of red wine, and a big mac, all in a matter of
                    <strong>
                        seconds
                    </strong>
                    , and furthermore, if that really is your lunch for the day, be able to log it and view rich visualizations of what you're eating compared to your custom nutrition goals?? We set out to find the answer by developing macroS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    macroS integrates seamlessly with the Google Assistant on your smartphone and let's you query for a full nutritional breakdown of any combination of foods that you can think of. Making a query is
                    <strong>
                        so easy
                    </strong>
                    , you can literally do it while
                    <em>
                        closing your eyes
                    </em>
                    . Users can also make a macroS account to log the meals they're eating everyday conveniently and without hassle with the powerful built-in natural language processing model. They can view their account on a browser to set nutrition goals and view rich visualizations of their nutrition habits to help them outline the steps they need to take to improve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DialogFlow and the Google Action Console were used to build a realistic voice assistant that responds to user queries for nutritional data and food logging. We trained a natural language processing model to identify the difference between a call to log a food eaten entry and simply a request for a nutritional breakdown. We deployed our functions written in node.js to the Firebase Cloud, from where they process user input to the Google Assistant when the test app is started. When a request for nutritional information is made, the cloud function makes an external API call to nutrionix that provides nlp for querying from a database of over 900k grocery and restaurant foods. A mongo database is to be used to store user accounts and pass data from the cloud function API calls to the frontend of the web application, developed using HTML/CSS/Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to use the different APIs and the Google Action Console to create intents, contexts, and fulfillment was challenging on it's own, but the challenges amplified when we introduced the ambitious goal of training the voice agent to differentiate between a request to log a meal and a simple request for nutritional information. In addition, actually finding the data we needed to make the queries to nutrionix were often nested deep within various JSON objects that were being thrown all over the place between the voice assistant and cloud functions. The team was finally able to find what they were looking for after spending a lot of time in the firebase logs.In addition, the entire team lacked any experience using Natural Language Processing and voice enabled technologies, and 3 out of the 4 members had never even used an API before, so there was certainly a steep learning curve in getting comfortable with it all.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to tackle such a prominent issue with a very practical and convenient solution that really nobody would have any excuse not to use; by making something so important, self-monitoring of your health and nutrition, much more convenient and even more accessible, we're confident that we can help large amounts of people finally start making sense of what they're consuming on a daily basis. We're literally able to get full nutritional breakdowns of combinations of foods in a matter of
                    <strong>
                        seconds
                    </strong>
                    , that would otherwise take upwards of 30 minutes of tedious google searching and calculating. In addition, we're confident that this has never been done before to this extent with voice enabled technology. Finally, we're incredibly proud of ourselves for learning so much and for actually delivering on a product in the short amount of time that we had with the levels of experience we came into this hackathon with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made and deployed the cloud functions that integrated with our Google Action Console and trained the nlp model to differentiate between a food log and nutritional data request. In addition, we learned how to use DialogFlow to develop really nice conversations and gained a much greater appreciation to the power of voice enabled technologies. Team members who were interested in honing their front end skills also got the opportunity to do that by working on the actual web application. This was also most team members first hackathon ever, and nobody had ever used any of the APIs or tools that we used in this project but we were able to figure out how everything works by staying focused and dedicated to our work, which makes us really proud. We're all coming out of this hackathon with a lot more confidence in our own abilities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for macroS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to finish building out the user database and integrating the voice application with the actual frontend. The technology is really scalable and once a database is complete, it can be made so valuable to really anybody who would like to monitor their health and nutrition more closely. Being able to, as a user, identify my own age, gender, weight, height, and possible dietary diseases could help us as macroS give users suggestions on what their goals should be, and in addition, we could build custom queries for certain profiles of individuals; for example, if a diabetic person asks macroS if they can eat a chocolate bar for lunch, macroS would tell them no because they should be monitoring their sugar levels more closely. There's really no end to where we can go with this!
