                    I was thinking about why we still haven't built a space elevator? Even thought this was the initial ideal behind this. It was for me in away to prove that this could function based on the radius of our planet. It seems that it would be difficult for us to build a elevator off the earth because even when built in optimally conditions. It seems that even with centrifugal acceleration  that would cause the some error within the tethering system or it could be the fact that I'm not making sure that the nano-tubes are spun into a braid.  But it could just be my math.
