                    By triggering action words like "Homework due" it crawls through a dummy blackboard site, reads deadline due dates of a specific course and sends that data to google assistant and reading that data out.

                    Using previous knowledge of using data scraping tool to make a text file and make our google assistant read that text file.

                    We will be using the same algorithm and data scraping tool to create some new features like reading notification from blackboard or other websites. We will also build automatic google calendar updates from actiongini.
