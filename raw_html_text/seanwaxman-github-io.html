                    I wanted to build a website for the first time so I decided to base it upon one of my interests, vexillology. I find flags cool because something which can seem so insignificant can be used to identify a country or give someone information about that country simple off colors included in a rectangle(unless its Nepal which is a weird triangle shape). I learned basic HTML, CSS, and javascript for this project. The project displays flags and lists the country the flag represents below it. Users can click on the flag to display the next flag in the series of flags. I hosted the site of github as it would be easy to see versions of the site I used and that it was free to host my site there.
