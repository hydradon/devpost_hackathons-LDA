                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teaches coding in an easy, non-intimidating way. It also provides a one-stop access to information about our field, hands-on experience and networking opportunities.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We broke down the bigger problem into smaller subtasks. Next, we broke our team into pairs to program different parts. We used HTML, CSS, Javascript to build the website and Mock-ups to develop the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were new to using GIT meaning that we ran into issues understanding how to use it. In deploying the website, we struggled to set-up to the server.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As new hackers with non-tech group members, we are proud to have built a working website and MVP app design that we can demo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came into the Hackathon as two separate groups, but we came together and worked well as a team even though we had just met. The new hackers with no experience learned how to use new programs that they had never seen before.
                </p>

                    What's next for AllTheCodingLadies
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We aim to build a working app that can be deployed to spread what we have learned during this Hackathon.
