                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I got pretty sick and tired of having to upload my resume to a million places (LinkedIn, CareerBuzz, Handshake, Google Drive, recruiters who one is in conversation with, the jobs that I applied to online that allowed resume updating...) whenever I had to update my resume. Often, these changes would be a small typo I notice, which take a couple seconds to fix in a text editor, but a block of time to deploy everywhere.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Runway will take your resume and upload it to LinkedIn (as media under your profile description), CareerBuzz, and Handshake. Some planned future integrations are any Workday/Greenhouse.io job, Google Drive, and even CI/CD for git-happy folks who use LaTeX.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Browser automation (Selenium) scripts run within a Node/ExpressJS server with a UI layer (ReactJS) on top.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My original plan was to use these services (LinkedIn, CareerBuzz, Drive, workday job apps, etc)'s public APIs to accomplish most of the resume updates. When I discovered most of the companies don't offer public APIs, I endeavored for a couple hours trying to crack their private APIs, which was really hard; the folks who secured the giant LinkedIn's private API are probably a

                        tad
                    </em>
                    bit smarter than I am. Eventually, I pivoted towards a more practical alternative (browser automation).

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                    Building something that I'd actually use, and that I'm excited to continue working on when I get home.

                    <li>
                        how to sniff high-level network traffic (past using the Network tab in your browser)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        gained familiarity with browser automation and testing frameworks--super useful! Can think of plenty of uses for these for any future personal project or job.

                    What's next for runway
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm never satisfied with a project. Runway needs:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        actual linting, testing, and pipelines set up. Testing especially important, as browser UI-based automation is vulnerable to breaking due to website updates.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        authentication built into Runway--more elegant process for the user than expecting the user to sign in ahead of time. For my personal use, this is fine; for deployment this is annoying. Unfortunately, most of the services Runway integrates with do not have public APIs and/or are not very friendly towards OAuth, so we shall see what happens...
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        other deployment and scaling thoughts. Using a Desktop app (Electron?) rather than a webapp, especially since Runway needs access to the user's filesystem (to access browser cookies that have authentication state).
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                This sounds preeeettttty baaad, I know, but the alternative is that the user does the equivalent of ZIPing up all their passwords in plaintext and uploading it to a website I manage. Which is probably way worse.
                            </li>
