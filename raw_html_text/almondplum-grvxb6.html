                    How we built it
                </h2>

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Installation of angular.js and npm (ran into permissions issues with shell), submitting txt records, both very time consuming road-blocks.

                    Animated, giant 3d almonds and/or plums that users generate by interacting with the site.
