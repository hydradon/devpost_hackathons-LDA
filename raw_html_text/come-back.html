                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a model that would predict where people will be based on their past habits
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given a user history and a location, give back when they will be back to the location
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We trained on user data using azure ml
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding the right features to train on
                </p>

                    We learned how to start training ml models
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
