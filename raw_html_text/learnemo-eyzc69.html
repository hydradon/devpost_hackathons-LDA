                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought of using the Microsoft emotion api in a classroom setting to better understand student's emotions during class.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the data from the Microsoft emotion api we are able to provide detailed analytics for teachers to better understand how a student is understanding information during class.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We captured the data with photo and video and used the Microsoft emotion api to analyse possible emotions, we then transfer that data to a webpage that inputs the information into easy to understand charts thanks to Charts.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were challenges in both acquiring the data and setting up the webpage. First we had trouble understanding and retrieving the data while working with the Microsoft api. We also encountered challenges while setting up and designing the webpage (front end and back end).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we are able to work together while encountering hard to grasp tools such as the Microsoft emotion api and Chart.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it is rather difficult to not only understand how to use these tools but also be able to use the data in a way that is easy to understand. We focused a great amount of time to learn the concepts, not accounting for the fact that applying the skills actually takes more time to do it right.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LEARNEMO!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope that we are able to better help teachers to understand the emotions of students during lectures, assisting students where they are confused the most.
