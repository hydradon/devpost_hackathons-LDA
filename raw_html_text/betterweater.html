                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Don't you hate it when you don't know what the weather is outside? It's 10 degrees outside and silly you forgetting to check the weather goes outside in a T-Shirt. This is what our app is for. It's a notification and alarmed based app that reminders people to put on more clothes when the weather is colder.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The frontend of the app is a basic weather app. It displays the temperature, humidity, visibility, chances of rain and other useful information. And the most useful piece of information of all, the appropriate clothes to wear. It also fetures an alert which users can set to get a daily alert of what to wear.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is built purely out of Java and XML.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team is pretty inexperienced and we had to learn a lot of stuff like http requests on the way.

                    What's next for BetterWeather
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is far from done. There are a lot of tweaks and optimizations that can be done to make the app better looking and easier to use.
