                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We saw all the fun mobile apps that encouraged real-world exploration like Pokemon Go, and wanted to make a similar social experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web app provides "challenges" in the form of questions that users must answer with a photo. Questions and answers alike can be serious, witty, or funny. Users may then view other people's photos or submit their own challenges for others to try.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host the web app (EC2) as well as store all of the data required (EBS). The app itself was made with JavaScript via Node.js, with the visuals made with Bootstrap.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team had no experience with AWS, as well as very little experience in making a web app. As such, a lot of learning had to be done in order to get a working product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This being our first year at SpartaHack, a minimal working example is a huge success! We were also very satisfied with the Bootstrap-enabled responsive design, which enables our app work on both desktop and mobile.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about frontend&ndash;backend interaction. Seemingly simple tasks such as photo storage and retrieval were surprisingly nontrivial, and the process taught us a lot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Snap Conquest
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's a lot we didn't have time to do! Things such as friends lists, friend-only challenges, timed challenges, viewing submissions by location, and a better browsing system and voting were all planned as stretch goals. Overall, gamify-ing the app would be the next priority.
