                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought of it after some debate, and thought it would be a fun way to spend even more time debating whether or not FCPS will school the next day.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each user registers and logs in in order to create a profile in which they can make predictions for the next day. By predicting correctly, they gain reputation points, and by failing to predict correctly, they lose reputation points. Each user is able to also see a list of other user's predictions and reputation points, promoting a fun competing environment.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using android studio. Parse was used as a backend service in order to store user's data and information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Along the way, we wished to be able to somehow verify whether or not user's predictions were correct by looking at FCPS websites and tweets, but we weren't sure how to go about doing this. As a result, we instead used an admin account that would function the same way. Along the way, we also wished to use a navigationwindow, but encountered errors connecting the fragments and activities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to use the Parse api in order to create our app. We are also proud that we were able to build a relatively complete project in such a short time
                </p>

                    What's next for CloseFCPS (Snow Day Predictor)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wish to be able to format it in a way thats more appealing to the eye, as well as connect it to databases such as MongoDB. Additionally, we wish to use the app to predict future snow days based not only on weather reports but also on history of snow days. lastly, we hope to scale this project to all counties and regions.
