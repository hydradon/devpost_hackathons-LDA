                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team was inspired by the gleaming issue in modern security: the lack of protection from numerical passwords, as well as their difficulty to remember.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This script is designed to take an image from a computer or phone's camera and compare it with a variety of reference images (or images added by the user). Its purpose is to determine if the user's face is stored in the data of program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program was written entirely in python, and used multiple external modules, including numpy, opencv, and matplotlib.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, the best tool to be utilized in facial-comparison via opencv is no longer built into the module. This challenge was overcome through the use of alternative identification strategies. In addition, one of our members (we do not have his email to register him) had to leave the event early.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team is proud to say that our prototype code can successfully recognize common faces between sample images, as well as consistantly detect the location of any faces in front of the camera.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team learned much about the application of modules in python, as well as the many different ways in extrapolate data from an image feed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FaceAuthenticator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step in our project is to discover additional ways in which to recognize the facial features that will result in less extraneous points. Complete implementation for the camera in facial-comparison is also to be improved.
