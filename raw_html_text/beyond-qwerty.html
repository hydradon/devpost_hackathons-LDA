                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A few months ago, I heard about another keyboard layout, dvorak, that was supposedly more efficient and faster than QWERTY! Upon further investigation, I found many other layouts that all promised the same things - efficiency and speed. I made this app so people can easily try other layouts without fiddling with annoying settings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Open the site and flick the switch. Your keyboard (in qwerty) has just been transformed into a keyboard in dvorak. Type around and test it out!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HTML for the structure, CSS for the style, and Javascript for the functionality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I thought of this idea at 11pm at night so I didn't have too much time to complete it. My knowledge of CSS is also pretty low but at least I had w3schools.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of just making a project that is functional on my own.
                </p>

                    <li>
                        Be better at coding.

                <p>
                    I will add more layouts than just dvorak (colemak, azerty?).
