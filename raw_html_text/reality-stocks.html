                <p>
                    Leap Motion has been around since early 2012. Not many developers have worked on huge projects. That's why Team Reality Stocks had thought about working with complex hand tracking technologies that aren't really available to the public. It's not very known so we gave it a try and we were blown away by the results. WE WERE CURIOUS. WE WERE HUNGRY and that's why we're building hand technologies cause it looks cool.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Reality stocks makes viewing and interacting with stock market data more engaging (and fun).
