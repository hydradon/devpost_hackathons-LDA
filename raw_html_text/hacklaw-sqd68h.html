                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just wanted to make people conscious of the amount of carbon oxides that we produce, and how easy it could be getting rid of a vast majority of them by simple actions as walking.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application integrates a GPS that tracks the movement every time it finds a change in the location, it calculates the movement, and then determines whether the user moved with a vehicle or on foot. It gives specific punctuation depending on the percentage of each movement you've done that day. This score (out of 100) can be later be compared to previous personal averages. It exports all daily data in a .txt file while the relevant data of the other days in another.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First of all, I started by the layouts, and once the layouts were drawn, I started with the most basic functions like the display of objects on screen or stuff like it. Once I've done, I decided to focus in all the algorithms that lay behind, like the GPS, the averages and the writing on files.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The GPS provider using the GPS itself won't work, so a network provider had to be specified in order for it to work.
Formatting of time and management of the different data in .txt files.
                </p>
