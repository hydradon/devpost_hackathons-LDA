                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During work as a tutor for the academic success center one of problem that ended up normally occuring was when there was a shortage of tutors for the number of students that wanted to recieve tutoring
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project takes data about students visits and analysis it to make predictions about when students will be coming for tutoring and for what classes to better help with staffing and how many tutors need to be hired.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During the course of this project I learned how to code in C# and how to make a GUI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tutor Analytics
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step in this project is to make and implement new data structures to give user a greater control how they want the data broken up. After that data structures are implemented,  controls for how the data will be processes and what information will be displayed will be added.
