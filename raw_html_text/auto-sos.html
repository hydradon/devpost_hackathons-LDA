                    Inspiration
                </h1>
                <p>
                    One of our team members, Shaown, had his car break down in the middle of nowhere, and was stranded because he was unfamiliar with his surroundings at the time and did not have access to services like AAA (American Automobile Association). Our app aims to help prevent situations like this by allowing people to ask for help from people near them.

                <p>
                    Our app is like Uber for car repair. AutoSOS would allow you to request help from your current location, and also allow people to help others near them.

                    How we built it
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We decided to move on with React Native. This decision was made because most of our users would likely be stranded somewhere and would be more likely to have access to a mobile phone with Internet access. Using React Native also shortened our development time by allowing us to compile apps quickly.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to use React Native, and getting the apps to compile properly (a major pain point, especially for the Android app) in React Native alongside GitHub/git implementation.
                </p>

                    Getting a working app.
