                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alzheimer's patients are in dire need of a way to remember important parts of their daily life. With Reminiscence.AI, these patients can now achieve the level of memory that would make them optimally productive and satisfied with daily life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A user will be able to pull conversations with people and pull those same conversations at a later time when needed to help them remember context in a current conversation. Essentially, their memories are stored in text format and pulled from a database when they need help remembering them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used XCode to develop the iOS application and Flask to create the backend of the application, and utilized NLP inside the iOS application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges developing the Android app due to the ineffectiveness of many Android speech-to-text API's.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were proud of our iOS application because it effectively leveraged NLP libraries and our Flask backend to accurately recall memories based on context
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work with natural language processing, deploy a backend in python and Flask, and develop a front end in iOS
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Reminisce.AI
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we wish to integrate Reminisce.AI with social media in order to get the Alzheimer patients friends and other social media content to display profiles of their loved ones in a simple and organized manner.
