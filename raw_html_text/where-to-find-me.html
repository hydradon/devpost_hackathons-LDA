                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the top of our resumes, we have so many links: GitHub, personal site, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc. What if there was a way we could combine our online presence/portfolio into a single sharable link? Well now we can with Where To Find Me!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our webapp provides a service that allows users to consolidate the links to their professional networking sites and social media accounts into a single, easy-to-use link to share with potential recruiters. Just go to wtfindme.net/ryan to check mine out. Additionally, we never actually know if recruiters ever click the links we share on our resume. When you login to our app, you can browse your analytics dashboard to see just how much traffic is going to your individual links.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a flask app running on an EC2 instance connected to DynamoDB in the back and used JavaScript on the front.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first approached this project with the goal of making it very scalable and modular, but with the constraints of time we realized it is often better to start by creating the minimum viable product and then expanding from there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to make a pretty cool app that we're all proud to say we worked on. Our team was able to overcome the difficulty in creating presentable frontend with the little UI/UX experience we had.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use d3.js and chart.js as well as how to quickly get set up in AWS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Where to Find Me?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to work on improving the analytics dashboard by adding more functionality for professional networks such as Linkedin and Dice and would also like to polish the user landing page by scraping some content from your social media accounts to display, such as popular GitHub repos or Twitter followers.
