                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game Clue.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You're a detective picking a filthy criminal from a line-up (hence the name) of suspects to a crime. You're given a set amount of clues and you have to try and deduce the answer to the question, "Who dunnit?". Pure logic and brain power are your greatest tool in this game of pure logic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We slapped some Unity and Adobe together in hopes something good would come out. Thank goodness it did! We were able to get a decent prototype of a game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us were beginners and had no idea what we were doing. We just drew some characters on a sketchbook and went with it. We ended up getting a small prototype.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a working example. As I said, we managed to achieve only a small prototype, but it's our prototype, and we worked on it, which makes it special to us. We stuck together, and worked together, and created a humble little .app file to submit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use all the programs we used. We also learned that it helps if everyone had the same OS. It was a fun experience, with bumps in the road.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Line-Up
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are EXTREMELY excited to say that we are going to keep developing adding more and more until this is a full-fledged game. Even if we don't make it to first, or third, or second place, we will still take this prototype, we will build this prototype, and we will make a game. We want to make more levels, more characters, more clues, more of everything!
