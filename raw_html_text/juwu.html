                    Often times, dogs eat human food without the owner knowing. Because of this, our team wanted to make a web app that could easily determine if the food is safe for dog consumption or not. This is an incomplete version of the program.

                    Even though none of our team had any backend experience and had a very limited amount of time (since most of our members had to leave early), we decided to challenge the odds to make something.
