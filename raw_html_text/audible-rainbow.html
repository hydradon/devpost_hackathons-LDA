                    Our app main audiences are people who suffer from visual impairment like blindness or color blindness.
Through
                    <strong>
                        Android-Studio and Google Cloud API
                    </strong>
                    , we were able to create an Android app that would let the user aim their camera at anything and the app would tell them what dominant colour that object has as well as where you can find these colors and what meaning these colors have in our everyday life. Like red represents excitement and blue represents peace.

                    It was our first time using Android Studio and the Java with it, we came from other coding background and would like to learn something different, so there were alot of challenges setting it up at first. We were also having alot of trouble trying to use the Android API.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, we were able to pull through and create functional app despite having only three people with no prior experience. We learned how to do basic request POST/GET to remote server as well as the basics to create an Android App with functional I/O.

                <p>
                    Audible Rainbow is functional, however, we would like to make it more accurate in predicting the main color names and also update the visuals and descriptions of the basic colors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were also thinking of implementing voice control as well.
