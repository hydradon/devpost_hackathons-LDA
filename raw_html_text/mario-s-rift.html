                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We knew the popular game, Fez, had incorporated the idea of assimilating split viewpoints mentally. We decided to take it one step further and apply this to the beloved platformer, Mario, and to add Oculus Rift support. We also make a design decision to make the game harder than most platformers, since the genre has been watered down in recent years. Adding LeapMotion support helps with this idea because it requires greater body awareness, control, and timing than playing with just a keyboard and Oculus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You see the main camera on the Oculus Rift in first person. In the top left corner is the "traditional" side view camera. You then have to traverse the level using spacebar (or the Leap Motion) to jump, and using the W and S keys to move forward and backward.
