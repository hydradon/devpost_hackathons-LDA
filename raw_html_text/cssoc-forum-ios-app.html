                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A suggestion made at this year's CSSoc annual meeting was to create a mobile app for the forum. I was also slightly interested in learning about development on the Apple platform.

                <p>
                    Loads the UOIT CSSoc's forum website and can navigate around

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Swift, compiled with Xcode 9.1 on macOS Sierra 10.12.6
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was my first time coding with Swift, let alone creating an iOS app
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    Finished a really simple version that works (for now)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A very tiny bit of iOS Swift programming in Xcode
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CSSoc Forum iOS App
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More features/functionality, better app design/UI and navigation?
                </p>
