                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We asked our friends, "What is the most random app you can come up with?" They thought of ideas for an app to resurrect the dead, or alert friends when one is dying. But then, at 3:07 AM the day of HackHolyoke, we received our answer.  Give the computer an object, and it would draw a picture of it. Well, as first year CS students, that was far beyond our capacity. But we embraced our crappy coding abilities and crappy artistic skills, and thus the Crappy Drawing Machine was born.

                    . What category of crappy art are you looking for? An animal, nature, food, or something else? What color should it be? Select what you want, and the machine proceeds to select the perfect image for your needs. Maybe you don't know what category you want? Well, click "Surprise Me!" and the machine will find just the right picture for you, and even change the color! Maybe you have your own crappy art that you believe deserves to be included? Navigate to the Submit Your Own tab, and follow the instructions! Your art will soon appear on our website, so you can show all of your friends just how crappy your art is!

                    Through blood, sweat, tears, and a sacrifice or two, the four of us piled together our

                    knowledge from our 6 weeks of CS101, and used the only thing we know: Unity and Javascript.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Everything. We had no clue what we were doing. Google and the Mentors became our best friends, as we basically tried to learn everything we could.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made something. It wasn't what we initially dreamed of, but it is something. We went through a moment around midnight when we were convinced that the only way to do this was to make about 300 buttons on the screen. We managed to reduce to 8.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the power of teamwork, energy drinks, mentors, and Google. We learned how to build a website, not go crazy, and when it is time to sleep.

                <p>
                    Who knows. More drawings, more colors, more interactive UI. Maybe even some more buttons?! Crappy Drawing Machine has so much potential, and can go wherever it wants.
