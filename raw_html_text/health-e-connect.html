                    Patients who are identified as high risk by their doctors are asked to &ldquo;buy-in system&rdquo; by purchasing their patient-specific QR code (fridge magnet/ID wallet-card). As this is an insurance of patient care, the patients would not have to pay for anything further than the QR code. This QR code will not only allow EMS access to patient records, but it will also be the patient&rsquo;s approval to share their EHRs with other medical services in the Healthcare Network. This, along with a two-step verification of the EMTs would allow them to already have access to pertinent patient information, eliminating wasted time at the site of emergency. If and when medical transportation is required, EMTs/Paramedics will then be able to send this &ldquo;Emergency Narrative&rdquo; directly back to the hospital where the patient will be receiving the medical services. In this way, the hospital can have quick access to the patient&rsquo;s emergency narrative and can begin setting up necessary nurses, equipment and rooms to cater to the patient&rsquo;s needs. This will eliminate waiting time in the ED and can effectively communicate to the nurses all the pertinent information they need to know, which had already been verified by the EMT/Paramedic personnel. By connecting the patient&rsquo;s EHR to the EMS, EMTs will reduce their time at the site of emergency, EDs can effectively prepare to treat the patient and the patient will be comforted knowing that they will have a more streamlined access to the medical attention they need. By offering this service as a Health Information Exchange, we are able to improve the quality of care and therefore reduce costs.
