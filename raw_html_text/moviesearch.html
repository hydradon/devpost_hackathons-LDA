                <p>
                    MovieSearch is for those times when you are out with your friends, and they suddenly start talking about a movie or show that you aren't quite caught up on yet. Instead of trying to fake like you know what your talking about or scrolling through miles of synopsis on your phone, MovieSearch was designed to concisely deliver the main points of whatever TV show or movie you need to know about.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MovieSearch was developed in TypeScript. I also used The Open Movie Database API to access the information for a fairly significant number of titles. The software uses the API to parse through the JSON files for each title, and pulls important stats from them to display in an easy to read user interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    My Experience
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first time using both TypeScript as well as Angular(and also my first real hackathon!). Although I struggled a bit to grasp both at first, I eventually figured out the basics of each and saw how they can both prove to be very useful to developers.
