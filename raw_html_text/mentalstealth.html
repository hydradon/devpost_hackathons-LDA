                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After my partner and I went to a workshop about twilio we decided to implement text messaging that send and receive sms. Having known someone who has depression I have learned that taking the initiative to speak to depressed people make them feel better. The thought of someone knowing how you feel and what you are going through is comforting. You can see this app as a guardian angel where they watch over someone they care about until it is known everything is alright.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app starts off with a 4 number pin screen but for sake of time password is not implemented. Once the check mark is hit the app grabs a number of messages. These messages are put into an arraylist and later scanned to find the positive or negative statuses of the message. For each message has the phone number it was sent from, the message, the date, and the sentiment value. Any number that is below zero is considered negative and any number that is above zero is considered positive. There are cases where the value is zero and that means it is a neutral emotion. The sentiment values do not go above or below 1.0, it stays in between so the strength in positive or negative message varies with a scale of 0.0 to 0.9. The app-user is hidden from the user they are monitoring so keeping unnecessary confrontation, for example: given care when not needed, ignoring the monitored user, anxiety from monitored user risen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio for the code and photoshop for the custom icon. Obtaining our sentimental analysis from IBM resources. To create the interface of our program we used xml provided in Android Studio. The first few tests to receive or send messages the command prompt was used to run the program. To test our code we use android cell phones for multiple trial and error sequences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating the sentimental analysis. Trying to put this API into our code was very difficult with the amount of unreponsive moments. Sometimes the frustrating part was when the values were not given at all. However, one of the most challenging moment was finding the API. I have looked through several resources almost 7 that runs perfect somewhere else besides our code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating the custom icon with multiple images and photo shopping. Having the API installed and run with the app next to each message is a milestone. Another accomplishment was sending and receiving sms to other phones with the program. The purpose of the program is to notify the user when another user has received something negative. Besides the provided messaging programs within the phone our app has created a way to receive and transmit the values when something is not right, hopefully.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that with the amount of API's out there it is difficult to find the correct one. I have gained more experience in Android Studio, why the xml file and the java file can correlate so well with one another. Transmitting of messages from sms can be retrieved with the right command prompt. The amount of messages that depressed people send is a problem and must be handled before it is too late.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MentalStealth
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step is to finish the password system, create a database that will save a profile for the user, having customized ringtones, sorting the messages from recent, and running in the background more efficiently. With the right amount of time this can be accomplished.
