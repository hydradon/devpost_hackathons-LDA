                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since none of us have experience in hardware, we decided to hack on IoT and give it a try.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a Moo Cow game.
                    <strong>
                        First
                    </strong>
                    , a cow will pop up on the screen and user has to memorize the movements of the cow.
                    <strong>
                        Next
                    </strong>
                    , a user has to move the joystick and it has to move exactly the same as the movements of the cow. If the user forgets or misses one of the movements of the cow, the game will ends (GAME OVER!) or else it will continues to the next level (Congratz!).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Keysight's Raspberry Pi and joystick, we are able to create the cow's movement on the screen of Raspberry Pi. We connect the joystick to the Raspberry PI and use wires to set up the device. We use Python script to run all these programs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up the Raspberry Pi was challenging at first but with documentations and help from Keysight's representative, we were able to resolve it quickly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since this is our first time developing a game, we are happy to have learned tools and technologies in IoT device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Raspberry PI and build a simple game on a Raspberry PI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Memory Moo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add more features such as the ability to keep track of the scores on Google Cloud Platform and add more challenging movements in the game.
