                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build something familiar but new, we decided to innovate upon a classic graphing calculator in a way that can be experienced completely differently.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We all agreed that when learning calculus (which is essential to many topics in Computer Science and Engineering) we found that visualization of material is the best way of grasping complexing and abstract topics. Particululary in Calculus 3 when trying to handle integrals that may not be easily represented on a 2D plane, this program allows for a user to not only visualize but immerse themselves in the actual content of a problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This calculator functions like any other graphing calculator however you are completely immersed in a Virtual Reality world where you can touch and modify the graph.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the graphing calculator using Unity, MonoDevelop, Oculus Rift, and C#
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning a new language always proves to be difficult, however it is a great experience to gain another set of skills and be able to develop for new platforms.
