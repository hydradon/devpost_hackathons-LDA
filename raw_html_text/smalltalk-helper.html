                    How Smalltalk Helper helps
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Smalltalk Helper proposes some potential conversation topics by using APIs to find a) something current and relevant or b) a random fun fact to talk about.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am very new to coding in general. Self taught, no background, but very passionate. I learned about APIs the week before I came here and I successfully wrote code for my first (!and second!) API call. This is quite likely to be old news for almost everyone at this event - However: HUGE success for me :)

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I made a fun little idea work. I wrote my first web app. And deployed it to a .tech domain! I am also quite proud of myself for staying up so late.
