                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As college students living a fast-paced lifestyle on a large campus, we are constantly meeting possible friends every day. With thousands of other students spread across a sizeable area, it is often that we do not run into a person we meet in a timely manner again. Social media exists to connect us online, but problems arise when you do not know the person&rsquo;s handle for a platform, or are unsure whether the person you find online is the same person you met. It would be much more simple if there was a platform on which only students at your university were available as users and could link their social media handles to you upon request.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A user belonging to a group can create a profile that can only be searched by members of that same group (i.e. only Vanderbilt students could look up other Vanderbilt students). The user can then enter the name of another member they have met and are given the option to connect with them, which sends a request to that user. The user that receives the request receives a notification and is then allowed to choose which common social media handles (i.e. Facebook, Snapchat, etc.) they would like to provide to the requesting user. The requesting user will then receive links to those social media profiles and can add that person on all platforms that were provided.
                </p>

                    Challenges we faced
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making the friend requests and acceptances more intuitive and user-friendly was a difficulty. In addition, modelling the database and building a schema to represent the specific requests was also a challenge we faced. There were also some logical errors that needed adjustment, such as duplication of accounts during requesting and accepting.

                <p>
                    With cliqwith.me, we are excited to have formed a social networking tool for students, developers, professionals, and the ordinary person. We are also happy to have ironed out the major issues that were getting in the way of simple user interaction and the logical issues that were creating extraneous issues in the user database.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to tackle problems as a team, work together, delegate tasks based on specific skillsets, and manage time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Our future objectives include optimizing the search algorithm. We will also integrate our software with university event attendance, classlists, student organizations, and more. We will apply this to other universities in a similar manner. We will also expand this platform to networking events, hackathons, professional conferences. These events can register with cliqwith.me for a fee contingent on size of attendance and event, which would be the potential core of our revenue model.
