                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started off by brainstorming together on what we could do with Retro gaming. As we talked, we thought it would be exciting and fun to somehow incorporate fitness into the strategy of playing a game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As someone is being active, they gain points that helps them level up in order to be stronger than other plays that they play against.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Fitbit Ionic to gather fitness information in order to calculate the amount of calories one burns. With that information, they are able to gain points that will allow the character to level up and earn points.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of use knew Javascript, Swift, or how Google cloud/firebase worked. We all had to watch many tutorials on how to make programs in order to create this game. The only languages we knew were Python and Java, which were not very useful in what we were trying to accomplish. We did not know that we would face this type of problem, otherwise we would have chose something that was more in line with our knowledge and experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to have been able to create an original fitbit application and to have built up a simple game on Xcode.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it is very important to evaluate what languages would be needed in order to accomplish our ideas. To do it again, we would investigate the language needs before pursuing so that we would be able to make something based on skills we have.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RetroFit
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next is to continue to develop the app so that it is publishable to the public as an enjoyable game that will help others engage more with one another and have fun exercising and gaming.
