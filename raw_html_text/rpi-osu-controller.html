                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    osu! is a popular rhythm game that I wanted to get working on a portable device like the raspberry.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is literally no way to get osu working on the pi. Even if you got the x86 emulation working, you'd still run into problems with inplayable frame rates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some things I tried:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        wine emulator
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        java version of osu
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        installing dotnet on the pi and building the source code of the project
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Installing windows 10 IoT
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Installing android and then running the app through the android platform
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Emulating x86 on an ARM architecture is way too hard, and I didn't get it to work at the end.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the future, I'll have to play around with what can and can't be done on Linux.
                </p>
