                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Visualising past the third-dimension was somewhat of an intriguing impossibility until the computing powers of python graphic suites made it possible
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows the user to create and rotate n-dimensional objects and project them in a 3d vector space
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We generated vectors using haskell along with some basic analysis. We then ran the vectors through our code which could rotate and create a wire frame in the third dimension
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The mathematics behind the concept were tricky to say the least.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Grappling with graduate level mathematics in order to create a tool useable for all. Also, processing documentation is virtually non-existent for python version.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Several graduate level mathematics concepts including n-dimensional vector spaces, hyperplanes, projection of n-dimensional objects to n-1 dimensional objects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HyperPlane
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the program from the command line with inputs so that it can be called from other projects that work in n-dimensional spaces.
