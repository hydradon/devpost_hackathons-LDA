                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was that, being in Waterloo, not many people played sports. We rarely ever had enough people to play basketball, so we made this to premake events ahead of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It marks a location on the map and sends it to your friends so they can see when/where it is
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using android studio  and java on the mobile side, firebase for db, and javascript/html/css for web all using google map api
                </p>
