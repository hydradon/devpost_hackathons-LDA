                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build a fun VR game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You are in the ring, facing an opposing boxer. Dodge, dip, roll and the strike back to win the match!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google Cardboard's Unity plugin
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, the opponent was near impossible to beat, with lighting speed and constant flourishes of punches. Making it usable for the Google Cardboard, such that people weren't overwhelmed by needing to spin around and disorient themselves was one of the trickiest problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Landing punches and hits properly is something that I feel is a rewarding mechanic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <code>
                        Literal of type double cannot be implicitly converted to type 'float'.
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unity is good for some things, less good for others...
                </p>
