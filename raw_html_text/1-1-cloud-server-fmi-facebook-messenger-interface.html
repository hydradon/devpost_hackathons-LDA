                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've used 1&amp;1 for a ton of domain and hosting related services for different organizations and clubs I've been a part of. Love the product and service. Never heard of 1&amp;1 Cloud Server but it seemed like a cool product! Why not try out the API challenge (says every hackathon-goer)?
So...there were no Amazon Alexas left in the hardware lab. Crap. Can't do voice command. Oh well. Cortana? Nah. Twitter app? Nope. Chrome extension? Eh. Facebook chat bot? Yassss.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This Facebook bot allows admins of 1&amp;1 Cloud Server accounts to spin up or delete servers from their accounts (and also show information about the servers on the account).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used 1&amp;1 Cloud Server's API along with node.js to create a Facebook messenger bot, hosted on Heroku (since that was really fast deployment).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting set up wasn't too bad. The Facebook bot worked great! Until I tried integrating the API (which had wrappers for Perl, PHP, and Python...none of which I had chosen for my app). I used Postman to test my API calls, which helped a lot.
The node.js app also kept crashing on Heroku if I used promises for some reason (ugh). So getting the messages to be posted in the correct order was a pain.
When I tried displaying all of the servers on an account, I didn't realize I was dealing with a string instead of an array. So when I went to iterate over everything from i=0 to i=body.length, I crashed my Facebook, Heroku, and phone. Oh my. Bless JSON.parse().
I was debugging everything in production by deploying every little change to Heroku...

                    I learned so much during this time (see below) and have something that I can use on the go! (Though I wouldn't really need to manage many servers, haha).

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Would love to get all of the API options in! (Sadly, I only got to the main functions for the server...there were so many more opportunities). Also, I wanted to try out the other functions with Facebook messenger's bots! Could've had more user inputs to alter the servers (description, performance options, etc...). And of course, natural language processing!
