                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I always enjoyed considering how concepts such as logic, relations, and graphs play into human knowledge and learning
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It can "understand" certain statements based on sentence structure, learn "concepts", categories of concepts, how the concepts are related (relations), and using logic to make deductions. It can also have an emotional response to certain words
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Python to create a class for general concepts, categories for concepts, relationships of objects, for rules of deduction, word and word structure storage, a personality and a "brain" class that stores instances of all of the previously mentioned classes
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Build the logic class to work like acutal logic
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing most of the essential classes for the program, and managing to build instances of my classes
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To remember to test complicated classes through test instance of the classes before moving on
about my limited knowledge in logic, and brain processes
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BrainMaker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    finishing (and fixing) some of the functions in the class so that BrainMaker can formulate more complex responses, also to add a portion of code to allow some to make an AI from scratch
                </p>
