                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by a TED talk from Shawn Achor, my wife came up with the idea to support positive vibes in our family. Over dinner everyone had to tell at least 3 positive moments of their day. This simple technique helped to make our dinners so much more fun.

                <p>
                    Happy Moments boosts your happiness by focusing on the positive moments in your life:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Launch the skill and tell happiness coach Lexana your very own happy moments
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Whenever you feel sad or need some super powers, start Happy Moments and ask for a happiness boost
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Coach Lexana reminds you of your very own happy moments
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Compared to all the other affirmation skills available, Happy Moments
                    <strong>
                        actually tracks your very own moments
                    </strong>
                    and supports positive thinking by
                    <strong>
                        providing your happiest moments
                    </strong>
                    instead of random quotes.

                <p>
                    There were three major parts to this project: Research, Development and Testing
                </p>
                <p>
                    Research:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Read a lot about positive thinking and self improvement
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Attended Alexa Dev Day Berlin to learn about new features of the Alexa platform
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Development:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Created object model for users, moments and sessions
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Scribbled interaction model and defined intents and utterances with the Interaction Builder
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Coded the backend in Node.js and MongoDB
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>

                    <li>
                        While coding I used the Alexa Test Simulator which helped a lot to speed up my workflow

                    <li>
                        Most important was testing on an actual device
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>
                        When I tested the skill on a real device, it wasn't able to reliably record my moments, so I had to throw away my carefully designed intents and find a workaround
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>
                        I found a reliable solution for recording user moments
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I wrote an algorithm that transforms first person sentences to second person sentences
                    </li>

                    There's some space for improvement and I have a lot of ideas, but these are most important:

                    <li>
                        It's a single user skill right now, but it could also make sense for whole families
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Let users search for previously recorded moments
