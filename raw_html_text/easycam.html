                    The inspiration came really from a moment where we needed to share photos and videos from our

                    </a>
                    in a quick way while we were taking photos in some of the events that we are organizing. We realized that there's a huge bottleneck from the moment that you take a photo and that photo ends to any Social Media.

                        Yi Action Camera
                    </a>
                    (from Xiaomi) - the user goes to the built web application and selects the time frame that they want. The application imports all the media from that time frame and shows all the photos taken during that time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to optimize the selection process, the application splits all the photos by similarity using Machine Learning and then the user selects a cluster. Given that cluster, the application selects the best quality image.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And then, in less than one minute, you have the photo ready to be shared!

                <p>
                    The most important challenge that we had was when we realized at midnight (12 hours left) that
                    <a href="https://reactjs.org/" rel="nofollow">
                        React
                    </a>
                    was not compatible with the needed technology of the yi-action-camera library. We have had to run, a lot, in order to implement an alternative. 0 hours slept was the result at the end.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, none of us had experience with Keras so we had to spend some time researching and understanding this Machine Learning framework.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And finally, our experience with Express was very poor. So we have had to refresh our JS knowledge of this framework.

                <p>
                    We have learned how beautiful can be to be able to solve a problem with your own hands in just a weekend. A problem that we know one month ago while the hackathon of our university (
                    <a href="https://hackupc.com/" rel="nofollow">

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our first goal was to implement connection with a

                        Canon camera
                    </a>
                    - each member of the team has one. However, we realized that there's no SDK or API or library compatible with our cameras, yet. It would be really cool in a (near) future to add our cameras for using it in the next event.
