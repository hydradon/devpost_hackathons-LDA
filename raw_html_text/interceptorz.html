                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was wondering one day, while a suspicious car patrolled the outside of my house, why is there a drone flying close to my house. Then it clicked, some guys where using a drone, and flying it around the neighborhood, for who-knows what reasons. I wanted to create an anti-drone system, which is safe, and which is cheap to reload.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The drone destroyer, is a key to privacy in today's modern homes and companies. The system scans the perimeter, at a constant frequency, then upon detecting a flying object, it locks into the object and determines on it's flight patterns whether it is a bird or a UFO. Once the systems, passes a three point security measure, then the turret is loaded with a new type of ammunition called, JellyZig. The ammunition is fired from the mounted unit, from compressed air, and the with more or less decent accuracy, the JellyZig detects the drone, and releases weighted string, in hopes of tangling the props of the drone.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used an Arduino Uno, a Logitech webcam, a laser pointer, OpenCV, Python and Pyserial, aswell as a 3D printer, thanks to the tremendous help of microsoft.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into many challenges, and the product I imagined stepping into this hackathon, had multiple shortcomings. OpenCV couldn't be configured in such a short amount of time and the JellyZig couldn't be coupled with an IR distance sensor.

                    Building the project and using a 3D printer for the first time.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python, Arduino, soldering and time management.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    The real fun will begin, when OpenCV can begin to work. Stronger lasers will be incorporated and the JellyZig would be able to maneuver.
