                <p>
                    Being heavily influenced in our local chapter for best buddies, we are motivated high school students looking to raise as much as we possibly could for autism research. We decided to come to a HackTJ to use it as a platform to create an influential app for caretakers of kids with social problems. In the app, we have specified lists with everything a caretaker might need when taking care of a kid with autism. We know that parents and new teachers have a hard time introducing kids with autism to designated caretakers. Therefore, our goal is that any random person given permission of the kid's

                        aaware
                    </strong>
                    settings is able to open the app and know the kid's preferences from favorite toys to food allergies and emergency contacts.

                    The user is prompted a login page, where specified hint structures guiding the user through registration. The user is able to add their child's personal preferences. Now, when any teacher or care-taker is linked to the child's

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    We utilized Android Studio as our IDE of choice to build the Android application. In addition, we employed Git and connected a Github repository. We were able to use git pull, git push, and git commit to share our code and work efficiently on the project.

                    We plan to incorporate a cloud-based server, in order to securely host all of our data regarding a user (including their name, password, email, etc.). We may accomplish this by using the REST Protocol and connecting to an application server that may host a SQL server with many databases to utilize. In addition, we would like to utilize innovative technology, such as blockchain, to further increase the security of our application. Our main goal is to raise awareness to autisim, through our app and spreading the word abroad.
