                    Security kits seem expensive and still be exposed to fraudulant behaviour. You can't use a manipulated picture in court to prove that your bike was stolen or that somebody broke into your garden house. So how do you ensure that your images aren't manipulated?
                </p>
                <p>
                    For those reasons we developed Security3Blockchain, a low cost security kit based on the bitcoin technology to store hash values of freshly taken images directly in the blockchain to ensure immutability.

                    Challanging was building the complexity of this project pressured in an only 24-h time frame.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the end we were able to showcase our prototype showing that using the blockchain technology could improve the home security cam business and help our users to stay safe.

                <p>
                    We definitely learned how to develop complex solutions in a limited amout of time with limited resources. We also learned how to integrate the blockchain technology in an interesting use case.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We'll keep on developing interessting stuff, so stay in touch or hit us up!
