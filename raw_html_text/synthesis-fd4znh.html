                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The reason why we created Synthesis was because we wanted a platform for people that have been sexually assaulted to communicate freely and share their stories to create awareness.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So this web application builds a community around people with similar experiences, it features a chatroom for you to interact with them, and gives access resources for coping and conversation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was coded in html, css, javascript, and node.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to create a user friendly web application that makes you feel comfortable to enough to share experiences without it feeling intrusive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing it on time with a late start, and settling down with one idea! We are also proud of the impact this has into society and the progress surrounded by breaking the stigma of vulnerability.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When starting off with broad topics and then narrow it down, it was difficult to implement so many great ideas in the time we had.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Synthesis
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want this to be on a bigger platform and a bigger reach within therapy. Also add in a virtual journal so the consumer can write out how they feel if no one is in the chatroom. Hopefully soon switch to IOS.
                </p>
