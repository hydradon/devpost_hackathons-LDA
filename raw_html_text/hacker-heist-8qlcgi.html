                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Virtual reality games are usually for first-person, single player uses only. We decided to develop a more sociable game in which friends are able to co-op with each other and compete with their skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hacker Heist is a 3 person, asynchronous virtual reality game. The game's setting takes place in the midst of the night at a museum, in which a burglar, from a first person VR perspective in the Oculus Rift, attempts to steal treasures and escape. The 2 other players act as security guards and view the museum map from a top-down perspective, hunting down the burglar with flashlights.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hacker Heist was built using the game engine Unity and the language C#, with 3D models and art created in Autodesk Maya and Adobe Photoshop. The virtual reality headset used is the Oculus Rift Development Kit 2, and the 3 controllers are PS4 dualshock controllers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges that we ran into throughout the night include time constraints and game balance design so that there is a fair balance between the players so that one doesn't have an advantage over another.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create a sociable cooperative game for virtual reality that allows a person in the headset to interact with people in the same room as them, which is not a common theme among VR games today.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to develop asynchronous VR games and make virtual reality more social.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hacker Heist
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hacker Heist's map layout can continue to be expanded and added to for different gameplay levels, and a lot of the art can be improved and made more detailed.
