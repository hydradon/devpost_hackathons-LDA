                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are constantly bombarded with sticker bombed laptops of companies we want to work for. With this software we can give those stickers a real use other than esthetics and easily find out about and apply to these jobs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By taking a picture of a companies sticker logo, the user is automatically directed to an about page for chosen company to find out more about it.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was built with Tensorflow and Amazon Web Services to train and deploy a deep learning model to analyze the data set of logos.
