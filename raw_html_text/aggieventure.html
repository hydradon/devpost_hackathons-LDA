                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the idea of making a mini adventure around the TAMU campus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program takes in user input in the form of making a choice on what to do next and uses it to output the consequence of their choices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Glitch, which used the programming languages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into the challenge of not being able to figure out how to use switch-case syntax. We also had trouble getting the buttons to work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to finish the program. We are also proud of our counters that we got to function properly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Roshini learned how to code in Javascript and I learned how hard it was to make a text adventure game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Aggieventure
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next thing for Aggiventure would be the addition of more choices and events the user can go through.
