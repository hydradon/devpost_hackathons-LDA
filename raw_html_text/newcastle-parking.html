                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This has been inspired by the need to know where is available to park in Newcastle upon Tyne and the virgining availability of Alexa in cars.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simply you can ask where parking is available to see an overview of where is available, where is fill, and where is almost full. You can also state a location to get more detailed information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The back end is built in PHP and is running on an Amazon Lightsail instance. The data comes directly from the local authority who manage the car parks using a public API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge I have had is getting it to work without hardware to test it on. the simulator is good but sometimes you just need to experience it to understand the limitations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am quite happy with getting the large amount in information down to a manageable level. There are facts the user needs to know but they will be asking while doing other things (ie driving) and will not have the thought time to deconstruct a complicated or over ritch sentence for the information they require.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This has been my first successful outing with APL. I may use this knowledge to retrofit some of my past skills with a graphical knowledge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Newcastle Parking
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As the skill is used I will better identify how to interact with the user and how we can make the interaction process less frictional. As the target audience is in the car I really need to experience the upcoming Alexa auto option and see how they affect the interaction with the user.
