                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Listening to the speech on switching from ICE to EV ignited our team's interest in finding out if claims of lower financial cost and emission reduction were substantially backed and if the claims were signifiant. All three of us are interested in helping people change their habits painlessly for the social good. We hope through this hack that we will be able to help people make better financial decisions and help them help us make the planet greener.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ICE = internal combustion engine
EV = electric vehicles
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our hack is a web app that can easily be converted to a mobile app. We have the user login and have them enter their car make, model, and year. With that data, we are able to query into the database and get the mileage. At the same time, we give the user one of three options to enter the amount of miles they travelled. One way is to have them enter the miles they driven manually. The second way is we have them enter their start and end location and we calculate the miles based on that. The third, and most mobile friendly way is that we have them use the auto gps function. The user will click on the button before they start driving and the app will, based on their gps location, calculate the miles they driven until they click on the auto gps button again to stop counting miles. From these data, we also gathered the average gas cost in the given state and calculate the cost of the trip. We then compared this cost with the EV model that we created and displayed that to the user. Finally, we also have a history tab where the user can see a chart of all their trips, a graph that compares each trip they took on ICE with that of EV, and finally statistics of overall savings. We also have an interactive map background for users to check up upon their location while using the app.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app by using flask, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Ajax, JQuery, and PHP.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges that we ran into was integrating each person's different skills to build a singular application, merging each person's code into a singular application, and communicating with each other on what we're going such that all three of us aren't implementing the same function.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to accomplish what we set out to do and so much more. At first we weren't sure about how we were going to collaborate together since all of our skillset were very different; however, in the end we found out that our skillsets are actually very compatible and we were able to make quite a team and build an amazing application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned many technical skills throughout the process. In particular, each time we reached a roadblock in out code, at least one of us must take on the challenge to learn how to overcome that roadblock. In addition, all of us became more proficient in what we already know and learned much more about what certain language/frameworks can do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Evice
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that evice have a strong future. Not only do we plan on deploying evice as a web app for everyone to use, but we are also thinking about migrating evice to a mobile app to make it a more portable and accessible platform for drivers. In addition, we believe that there is much more data to be gathered and that can be analyzed that will help persuade consumers to adopt to using EV. Furthermore, we also believe that the more user that we have, the more data that we will be able to gather, which will in return help us improve our model and help us adjust/bolster our hypotheses.
