                    People everywhere must suffer everyday through a lack of a tiny truck blasting terrible music delivering pizzas through their neighborhoods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This changes today.

                    This is a tiny truck that will aimlessly drive around with pizzas in it while playing music and flashing shiny LEDs. It was built using various mechanical parts and sensors. The logic of the truck's behavior was programmed in Java while the app which allows users to open the truck to obtain a pizza was build for Android using Java for the front end and firebase for the back end.

                <p>
                    It wasn't all fun and games however, as we ran into some problems with developing our app, as well as connecting our app to the truck.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through these trials we've learned more about android development, mechatronics and robotics, as well as friendship and patience.

                    In the future, we would like to include a heating element to keep the pizzas warm, as well as require payment within the app before the pizza truck will open.
