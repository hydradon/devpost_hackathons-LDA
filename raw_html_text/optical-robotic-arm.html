                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the past couple of weeks, I (Caleb) have been working on a project involving encoders on the Arduino platform. When I saw the camera, I had the immediate idea of integrating it into some form of mechanical device, replacing typical encoders and resolvers. I met with Jiztom at the Vermeer booth, and we decided to take on the Vermeer challenge. We refined the idea and then set off to create it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our robotics platform replaces homing sensors and servo encoders with an all in one camera system. While our arm uses stepper motors, they could just as easily be replaced with geared DC motors or servos. Because of the way we implemented our code, a quick change to the arduino sketch would enable any form of rotary arm to be used. The arm is given an angle to reach, and calculates the best way to reach that position.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The arm itself it a bit "hacky" to say the least. Caleb constructed the arm using carboard and hot glue, while Jiztom worked to get the camera working. The arm was completed on the first night, but it wasn't until about noon on the second day that our camera started working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During the first night, we weren't even sure that the camera would work. It wasn't until noon or so that we got visuals from the camera. Apparently, the JeVois doesn't appreciate windows, so we had to install Ubuntu and work from there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We weren't able to get the hardware serial connection from the JeVois to the Arduino to work reliably, so we ended up using a bodge-y system with a computer as a sort of router. This ended up working fine for us, however, as it allowed us to enter in commands to the arduino, and have the encoder running at the same time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to get right to work despite never having met before this event. We were able to power through the issues that we faced, come together at the end of the event with a working product. We had fun!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I (Caleb) learned that I really don't appreciate linux, and Jiztom learned that he really doesn't like the Arduino 101 board. Both of us are not a fan of the JeVois Tutorials.
                </p>

                    <del>
                        While the arm may have looked prettier if we had utilized a 3D printer...
                    </del>
                    Our end product may not be the prettiest, and I would say that it's pretty hacky, but in the end it proved what we needed it to do. Caleb says that he might pursue the idea more in the future, but with 2 or more DOF.
