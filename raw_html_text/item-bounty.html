                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever wondered, about the number of items lost every day? According to the Daily Mail, the average person surveyed lost nine items daily. That's nearly 3,300 (3,285) items per year, and about 60 hours lost per year, or close to 2.5 days lost finding the item. Thousands of people lose an item every day and later regret doing so. People are still finding huge amounts of these lost items when it doesn't belong to them but return it back to it's the rightful owner, and we've found a solution.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scans QR code on the lost item(provided that it has the QR code previously registered with our app) and pings the owner, informing him that the item is found and after the item is retrieved by the owner, the person gets a rating which can be redeemed for rewards.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app using expo.io which is a free and open source toolchain built around React Native to help build native iOS and Android apps using JavaScript and React. We then used Firebase (Firestore) as the backend aspect of our project, specifically to store profiles in a real-time database that we could access and edit. Our app had 3 screens the home screen which was the profile of the user with his bio and rating while the second screen was the QR code scanner that could scan a QR code of a lost object and see if it matches with an object in the database and if it didn't an error is given. The third screen was the community section where people could post about their lost items and people could reply as if it was a thread. Once the item is received, the owner can give a rating to the person for performing a good deed which can be later be translated to rewards for stores.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Firebase and sleep. One issue led to the issue of the other.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We partially made an app that could scan a QR code and identify the owner which was very surprising to us. We used firebase to do this. In the database, there are multiple profiles of owners and each profile has a list of objects linked with it and if an object is lost and matches with the QR code of an object of the profile of a user than the owner will know that his item was found. It is basically a local lost and found which goes well with the idea of an urban city.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use real-time databases, develop user interfaces in order to produce an app that could be used widely by a variety of different audiences.

                    What's next for Item Bounty
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can publish our app to a larger audience on the play store or app store for more people to access and utilize our software. We can then learn to analyze the components of our app to improve and make it more user-friendly.
