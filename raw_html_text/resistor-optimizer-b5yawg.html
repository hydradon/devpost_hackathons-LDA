                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of my friends at Waterloo described that at his previous hackathon in Waterloo, he could not find the proper resistor values. He ended up testing many combinations of series and parallel circuits in order to find a good resistance.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project tests series and parallel circuits generated from a list of resistors. The user enters in a resistor value that they want to generate and then all the available resistors that they have. The program then tests out all the series and parallel combinations of the resistors to find the best combination. The output is then ordered in a list minimizing percent error away from the goal resistor.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used python to create this program.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, I are working on having the program search mixtures of parallel and series circuits. It is rather difficult as we must generate each circuit. I have not ironed out some bugs and have thus decided not to include it in our release. It should be coming soon however!

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am happy that I got the users scientific input to work! This allows users to enter in resistor values of "10k" and it show as a 10,000 ohm resistor!

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before this weekend, I did not know how to program in python! I am really glad that someone I talked to suggested that I did the project in this language. I feel much more confident in my programming abilities now as I have been able to pick up a language in a very short amount of time.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to implement an HTML user interface on top of the python program. I would also like to get the beta to work and to push it to the master.
