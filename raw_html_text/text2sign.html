                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had a roommate during co-op that was deaf, and I wanted to learn some sign language. I wanted an easy way to see how sentences could be translated into ASL
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simply put, it takes an input of sentences, and generates a gif of the sentences in ASL.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python's tkinter module was used to create a rough draft of a gui similar to google translate. Youtube ASL dictionary videos were gathered to create the gifs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Animating the instructional gifs in tkinter proved to be a worthy challenge. This bugfix is still ongoing.
