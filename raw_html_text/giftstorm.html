                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Upset at our lack of ability to find proper gifts for our friends in a timely manner, we created GiftStorm to help people find gifts better.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GiftStorm finds the perfect gift for your friends and family. We use artificial intelligence to curate gifts that people actually like - something that Amazon, Gifts.com, and other gift catalogs don't do a good job of. All you need to do is answer a few questions about the gift recipient and the most relevant gifts will be found for them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developing the front-end layout was a challenge as we had not had much experience with front-end development prior to this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front-end took a lot of trial-and-error, but we were glad to have the opportunity to gain insight into the front-end development cycle. We are also proud of the final turn-out of the project, as we were anxious as to how well we could get everything working together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our team development skills through version control and effective communication as well as experience with PHP and front-end development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GiftStorm
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could expand the various factors that are taken into account for the AI algorithm to create a more fine-grain gift selection process. This could lead to higher levels of accuracy in terms of matching certain aspects of a person with different types of gifts.
