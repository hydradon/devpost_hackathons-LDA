                </h2>
                <p>
                    Major Depressive Disorder is one of the most common mental health disorders in the United States and is a growing problem among adolescents and young adults. There are several treatments available to tackle this disease, including talk therapy which may incorporate mood trackers or journals. While mood tracking apps are a great tool for patients to self assess their progresses during treatment, patients often times forget to track their moods everyday or find it difficult to accurately and objectively rate their moods on a numbered scale.

                <p>
                    In this project, with the integration of the counseling services provided by Stony Brook University's "Counseling And Psychological Services" and bot technology, our mission is to make it easier for patients with depression to more accurately and consistently track their moods.

                <p>
                    This application was programmed in css, java, and javafx.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into trouble with creating pre-programmed responses to user input, formatting messages, and the difficulties associated with AI.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When someone is in a crisis and displays warning signs in the chats, the bot provides to the user Stony Brook University's Counseling And Psychological Services' contact information to seek immediate help.
