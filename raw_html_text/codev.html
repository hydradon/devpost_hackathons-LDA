                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We aim to promote technological innovation by making it more convenient for people to collaborate on projects and form Hackathon teams. Codev gets the ball rolling for projects that seem impossible and creates lasting connections with fellow developers.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Codev is a social media website aimed to bring motivated engineers, programmers and all alike, together. The user creates a profile and can look through a feed that suggests other "projects" that other nearby or similar users create. The user gets a feed indicating their interest in that project by swiping right. By swiping right, the projects will be added onto a list a user can look at after looking at a certain amount of projects and decide if they want to pursue them. With their profile, the user will have the opportunity to showcase their skills and meet others with the same interests and goals as them. And projects that are swiped right

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    -It was our first time setting up a website, and it was difficult trying to get it uploaded with the domain.

-Overall, it was a challenging experience.
