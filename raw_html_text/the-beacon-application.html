                    Beacon Application:
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a app designed to support the homeless and guide them. The first feature includes a package of quotes. These are famous quotes intended to uplift their spirits and let them know their struggle is not in vain. Also that there is some good in their situation. The second feature has a list of homeless shelters in the metropolitan area that we currently are residing in. They are marked on the map in red and if you press on the mark you can see the address of the shelter. The third feature also contains other organizations marked on the map in green for supporting the homeless. But they are not homeless shelters, they are mostly religious organizations.

                    Beside Beacon being an application for phones it will also come as a seperate device for poor people to afford.
The device will be called Beacon pod.
The Beacon pod would be made of plastic for keeping it cheaper. It will almost feel like a childs toy.
The estimated cost should be between $10-$20
The nice coloring and scenery is meant to uplift their mood to some extent.
For updating the quotes and the map if need be since this is not a GPS system it is a simple map with locations and addresses, there will be a USB plug at every homeless shelter for the Beacon pod. This will be to keep the device up to date for people to use.
