                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My friend and I tried to take a shortcut to metro station after a late-night movie. We turned into a street from the main avenue, and suddenly saw drunk people fighting on the street and homeless people staring at us. This contrast let me realize that even in the city center there are dangerous streets right next to main avenue, and it is impossible for tourists to know which street would be safe to pursue. It gives me the inspiration for this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It would identify the dangerous streets of cities based on users inputs. You can search for a city in the world, and saw the danger of each road based on its color with red being most people marked this street as dangerous. While the users can acquire information about which street is unsafe before they travel, they can also click on the street to mark the dangerous places.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our framework on HTML and JavaScript, where we employed some features in google map API, including geocoder, draw snap road, etc. For data storage, we imported Google Firebase and consistently updated the database when executing functions.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Acquiring suitable data that identify a segment of the road for each click.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    (Susan) This is my first time creating a website with Javascript and HTML. Furthermore, it is my first time to learn to fetch data interactively from online URL. I also learned how to use Google Firebase to store our database and use it interactively.

                <p>
                    A possible app of the same feature sharing the same online database for dangerous index, (with a buzz alert when move near dangerous streets). 
Mark all the dangerous county based on the crime data online to attract more users.
