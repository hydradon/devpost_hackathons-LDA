                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the classic platform games of the past.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You are Tupac and you must defeat all the Biggies
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Stencyl, a flash-game creation software
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to make the stomp animations and to get the sound effects just right.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first hackathon, and the final product to us looked very clean and professional.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how flash games are made and some of the coding that goes into them, as well as teamwork and determination
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tupac vs. Biggie
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to add more levels as well as more rappers to the game. Coming up is a Drake vs. Meek Mill battle.
                </p>
