It's a cross platform app meant to accompany American Airline passengers every step of the way in a cohesive manner, with ability to customize their experiences on and off flight. 
My team and I were relatively inexperienced with Flutter/Dart, but that only pushed our ability to learn and adapt.
However, due to technical issues our team faced the app barely made it off the ground.
