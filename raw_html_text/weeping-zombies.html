                    We live life as an adventure full of breathtaking experiences. Virtual reality has pushed the limits of human consciousness and allowed us to live life on the borders of euphoria and absolute freedom. This core beliefs serve as our driving mechanism to create technologies that make us happy to be ALIVE right now.

                    As a hardworking team of 3 engineering students in freshman year; we planned, designed and executed a prototype of a suspense video game. We used the Oculus Rift VR gear as an interactive approach to modern gaming coupled with the acclaimed 3D game engine Unity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We&acute;re specially proud of our collaboration and contribution of specific skills which was only possible thanks to the great environment and organization provided by all the staff.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The whole project was a big challenge for us but it was enjoyable as well. Our first obstacle was setting up the VR interaction as this was our first time experimenting with these awesome gadgets offered by MxHacks. The following difficulty was developing games in 3D without previous experience either in a programming language and development environment  we had never used before. At the end we were able to solve all of these issues with significant effort, and it paid off beautifully.

                <p>
                    During these 24h of creative insight and competitive initiative we learned new skills in interactive technologies but most importantly we improved our ability to work as a team and working with dedication and passion to achieve our goals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We successfully built a pretty awesome video game and profoundly seek to continue our development of Weeping Zombies. The next step is creating beautiful animations and immersive immersive environments with the hopes of further pleasing our users.
