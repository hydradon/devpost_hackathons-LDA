                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sitting in an auditorium,  we found each other over our love for technology and decided that the Myo Armband seemed like a great tool to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pro Motion is a tool that allows the Myo Armband to control a GoPro using web url's.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Armband sends gesture details to a PC, which sends we URL's to control the GoPro over the GoPro's WiFi network.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially had the intention of attaching an electric motor to a GoPro mount to allow for a swivel feature using gestures. However due to network difficulties and inventory constraints, we were unable to get the swivel working using an Arduino.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the program to run!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the importance of early planning, and how to allocate tasks within the team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pro Motion
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implement the motor swivel mount to allow for remote surveillance features in future iterations of the system.
