                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the widely popular game Cookie Clicker. We had no experience in making games, so we wanted to make something that was not too complex, but still a worthy challenge for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You click the computer to make money, which you can spend in the shop to improve skills and hire employees to click more efficiently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized the Processing IDE and Java programming language to code the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had almost no experience using this IDE or making games. We had to figure out all the functions that came with Processing while we were coding. Also, we didn't realize that we could use object-oriented code until it was too late to change all of our messy code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are definitely proud that we were able to create a functional and playable game in the time allotted. We were able to overcome our challenges with persistence, and ultimately, we achieved our goal. We also had a lot of good teamwork; we were able to efficiently delegate the work among ourselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Processing to code games, and also how to create an appealing user interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Coder Clicker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we will organize our code so it is easier to make further improvements. Next, we will add more interesting aspects, such as unique shop items and temporary boosts. We will also strive to improve our graphics to make the game a more enjoyable and immersive experience.
