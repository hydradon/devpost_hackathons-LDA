                    Inspiration

                <p>
                    We brainstormed and wanted something relatable to the average person. We also wanted a more story based project
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It educates teens and young adults on the dangers of technology as well as teaches them that they can use it safely

                    How we built it

                    Using Java

                <p>
                    We weren't able to finish the graphics portion of it.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We should use a different language when using graphics
                </p>

                    What's next for HackQuest

                <p>
                    move it to a language that supports more graphics and add more characters
