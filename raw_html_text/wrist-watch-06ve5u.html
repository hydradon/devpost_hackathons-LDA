                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My inspiration came from the fact that I enjoy hiking in the woods by my University. However, many people always warn me to be careful when I'm out there by myself. I tend to hike with pepper spray in hand and to be honest, it sucks. I wanted to make an app that was hands free that can actively keep you safe.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the accelerometer technology in the Pebble, Wrist Watch detects your intentionally large movements of your arm, which initiates a vibrating count down of 10 vibrations. The user can easily get out of the app by pressing any of the buttons. However, if the user is in danger and the count down goes to 0, the application will automatically SMS emergency contacts that can be coded into the script.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this using cloudpebble.io using C.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out the accelerometer was the hardest part of the entire project. Even still, it has some bugs in it. It took me the most time to figure out. Coding in C for the Pebble was a huge learning curve for me so many hours were spent researching accelerometer functions as well as the C language.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I can't describe how amazing it feels knowing that I got the accelerometer to finally work at the end. Although there are some bugs in it still, I am so proud of how far I have come since I came here yesterday. I'm very happy with all my small achievements I've made moving through this project over the course of 24 hours.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have learned so much about how to code for a Pebble watch. I've also learned about C as well as the capabilities of the cloudpebble.io platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Wrist Watch
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is so much that I want to continue to improve with this application. I would like to make the accelerometer work sharper when it reads x-axis values. I would also like to incorporate GPS into the emergency text messages so that the victim's loved ones can know where their exact location is.
