                    You can create short tutorials for HTML/CSS/JS.
The tutorials are snippets of code that the user can see in the background of an editor.
The student types the same code he sees in the background (similar to a tracing paper).
A live preview is shown of the code as the person types.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea is to learn by doing. By typing the example code. Not by just looking at it or copying and pasting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyone can create a Tutorial anonymously and share it (using the url).
Anyone can access a tutorial (as long as they have the url of the tutorial) and learn from them.
