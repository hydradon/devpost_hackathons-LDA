                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A currency which only holds value within the university campus that can be used at the student union shop, East Slope Bar, the Hatch, Library etc. This coin has a much smaller transaction fee than credit / debit cards, and a faster transaction speed. The issuer of the token will be the university itself and can be bought by students with credit / debit cards or cash.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using the Solidity programming language and the ERC20 token standard. The code was then compiled to byte code which is executable by the Ethereum Virtual Machine.
                </p>
