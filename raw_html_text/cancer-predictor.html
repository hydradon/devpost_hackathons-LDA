                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to encourage people to and get screened earlier than they think and the idea is that by having a prediction of when you were onset with cancer gives one a relative idea as to how to move this predictor to predict even if you don't have cancer but have some N number of mutations and given the rate of mutations to help in getting people to get screened earlier so they can treat earlier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given a genome sequence it predicts the age of when someone was diagnosed with cancer
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Pytorch I built many different models, and RNN, Feed Forward NN, Logistic, and Linear classifiers to see how it would behave on the TCGA dataset.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Debugging Pytorch and the node sizing to pool down correctly. Should have used a CNN now realizing that a lot of genome sequencing, 99 percent of dna is the same so I could apply a convolution to it to filter it out. Also reading in the data from TCGA.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works with 80 percent accuracy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of ML
                </p>

                    What's next for Cancer Predictor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use it to predict ahead of time instead of having immediate labels.
