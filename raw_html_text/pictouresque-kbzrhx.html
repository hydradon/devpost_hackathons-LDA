                    Inspiration; As a group of avid travelers, we wanted an easier way to receive information at our fingertips about our surroundings! Hence, the birth of Pictouresque.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does; The app allows users to take pictures of their surroundings and get an informative audio tour (featuring bites of information about what's in the picture).
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it; The app was built using Java and Android-studio.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into; We ran into a few issues while coding the app. First of all we did not realize that picture recognition software is still in primitive stages. Instead of making our own camera, we used an existing API to scan instead of take a picture, and then compare that scan to a library of buildings.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of; We're proud of having been able to work effectively with people we had just met. We're proud of the progress we made on the app, the information and research we gathered, and the design of our name, logo, and presentation. Being able to add our own creative flair makes the project completely ours.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned; The importance of diversity on a team! We have a computer science student, a computer engineering student, a mechanical engineering student, an economics and political science student, and an M.B.A. student, which allowed us to divide the work according to individual strengths.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pictouresque; We hope to grow the user-base so that users can generate information for attractions they visit. Our aim is to allow other users to vote for their favorite bites, and the most popular bites will be generated for users seeking information about that specific attraction. We also hope to create a feature that points users to nearby attractions, and connect to social media accounts to share about their experiences.
