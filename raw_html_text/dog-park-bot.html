                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Too often has dog kind ventured to the park to find themselves alone, this chatbot rectifies this age old dilemma.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This chatbot advances the happiness of both dogs and humans by allowng humans and dogs to know who else is at their local dog park.The app is attached to local dog park facebook groups. Enter all of the names of your dogs and check into your dog park. One word allows both checking in and checking out, another allows you to view all dogs that are checked in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This chatbot was built using Flask as the backend framework, and the Facebook developer tools for user interaction.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using SQLite and PythonAnywhere for deployment. The base package of Python Anywhere would often let connections expire which rapidly became frustrating as the bot was developed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Deploying my first bot, and one is that usable despite its simplicity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ways in which a Faceboot chat interface can draw JSON from an API to permit a chatbot. 
The structural differences in creating a chatbot as opposed to creating a website. 
Don't use SQLite or Pythonanywhere.com beginner accounts  for production; Start off with Postgres.
Most importantly, a new found appreciation and desire to build more chatbots.
                </p>

                    What's next for Dog-Park-Bot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Timer to automatically remove dogs from park after set amount of time (easily done, just ran out of time)
Better API back end
