                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Speaking with Tony, who is currently experiencing homelessness, was a huge motivation to provide something that would be truly useful to improve getting past square one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using personal information to provide tailored resources to at-risk or homeless people, to prevent and cope with crisis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the MVP prototype, HTML, CSS, and Javascript are utilized. In future developments, created with Sketch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In terms of designing and developing at the same time, development would be waiting on design. To combat this challenge, we presented one that is an MVP and one is a future state.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created an app that if it were developed to completeness, it would provide services that it would help those in a state of homelessness and those who are at risk.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about issues faced by people experiencing homelessness, challenges they face, and how to meet their needs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Square One
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Get the MVP live on a server as soon as possible. Reach out to local organizations to build a stakeholder buy-in to reach our 6 month goal of building out the application to fully allow for reservations and planning.
