                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to teach my teammate web dev in html, css, and JavaScript. This website is what we made while she was learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tells time and allows the user to pick from a number of pastel backgrounds for the site.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HTML for initial framework, javascript for time and color swapping functionality, and css for aesthetics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could have made something actually useful, but both Natalie and I had to leave after a while.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning html, css, and javascript so quickly, and building a javascript heavy site in just 5 hours.
                </p>

                    What we learned
