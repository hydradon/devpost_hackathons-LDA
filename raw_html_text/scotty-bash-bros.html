                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We both like Super Smash Brothers, and wanted to try making our own version in a hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It imitates SSB combat through 2-dimensional movement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity with Xbox Controllers and Nintendo Switch JoyCon controllers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity Input Manager by default takes input from all joystick controller sources, so each one has to be set up individually on a button-by-button and joystick-by-joystick basis. Also, controllers are not guaranteed to reconnect to the same port/slot each time they reconnect.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to have stand-in models move around the stage, and able to jump on platforms, with passing through them also possible on jumping and dropping. The camera also worked with 4 players by staying in the center of the screen space set by max coordinates of players, until they died and kept their positions at death.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making a complete game takes a lot of time, effort, and people. We were not artists, and had a friend help with pixel art the day before the hackathon. Also, a lot of inexperience with the Unity Input Manager showed us that sometimes simple tasks from video game consoles may be more complex than they seem. We only got to an Alpha version.
                </p>
