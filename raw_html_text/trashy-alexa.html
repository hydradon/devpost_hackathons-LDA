                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make an app for alexa that would tell you whether or not you could recycle something. However, this already existed, so we gave alexa a bit of attitude.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Assists user in what can or cannot recycled based off the troy area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used they alexa development tool kit and aws lambda functions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had created an alexa app before, we were having difficulties to alexa, and we had initial problems with the set up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a working project that serves as a baseline product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create custom skills for alexa and how trouble shoot with the alexa developer tool kit.
                </p>

                    What's next for Trashy Alexa
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is currently just for Troy, but we would like to expand it to include more areas.
