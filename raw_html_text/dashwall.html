                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've attended hackathons before, but had never used microcontrollers before. We wanted to learn how to use these tools while creating something that we ourselves would use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DashWall is a wall display with home diagnostics at-a-glance. It displays the time, and uses its sensors to determine the indoor temperature, sump pump water levels, and changes its brightness depending on ambient light levels.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built DashWall using Windows 10 IoT on a Qualcomm DragonBoard 410c, using a Microchip as a makeshift ADC to interface with our sensors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into an issue with transferring data from the Microchip to the DragonBoard that remained unsolved for several hours, eventually being solved by the addition of a ground wire between the microcontrollers. This was definitely a lesson we won't forget when using microcontrollers in the future!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We finished what we outlined in our MVP! Time display and sensor-driven temperature and adaptive brightness!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DON'T FORGET THE GROUND.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DashWall
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're looking forward to integrating more sensors and helpful APIs for things like displaying todo lists and weather forecasts.
