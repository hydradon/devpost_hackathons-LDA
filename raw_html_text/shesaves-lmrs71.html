                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When thinking of what app we should create we thought to ourselves, what&rsquo;s a problem that we as young woman encounter? We noticed that a lot of us always hear the phrases "you're still young start saving early" and "invest in your future!" but never really knew how to start. With this app, we have revolutionized the way in which young women manage their finances.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SheSaves is an app that works to assist young women by helping them save smart both short term and long term. Say you wanted to save up for a new car. This car costs $8000. You create a savings ring in the app and start saving! For every dollar you put in towards your goal, $0.90 goes towards the car, and $0.10 gets invested into stocks for long term investment... but not just any stocks. The money is invested into stocks of companies that are led by women, such as Oracle and Ulta Beauty. This was an idea that sparked when we learned that women only represent 6.6% of CEOs in the fortune 500 and we felt that we should empower these women.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not only can you save for yourself, but you can save together. We have group savings options that allow you to find friends, and set goals together, for concerts, get together's and more. 
You can set these savings rings to take a pre-authorized amount, or you can put in custom amounts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And best of all, our app includes Mona the money coach. We did some research to determine what the most common missteps were that young woman take regarding financial decisions and had Mona address these. Mona provides daily tips according to these identified problem areas. For example, young women often sign tax credit papers without knowing what they truly mean. Our virtual money coach Mona would help to teach them these tools through videos or articles it would recommend. With this app, we want to assist young women with saving their money as well as empower female entrepreneurs.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using figma UI/UX as well as writing a python script for the backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we ran into was solidifying all of our ideas and beginning the development stage. We were all very excited and keen on having certain features and sometimes this made it hard to settle on a final product. However, talking to sponsors and mentors really helped us stay on track, discard tedious ideas, and solidify our ideas into one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to design a functioning user interface and coordinate a platform that empowers young women to save, to learn how to better manage their finances, as well as empower female entrepreneurs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about prototyping apps, specifically designing a user interface that would appeal to younger women and motivate them to implement saving habits in their lives. We also learned about women-led businesses and that the proportion of female CEO's is very minimal compared to men.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SheSaves
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to fully implement Mona the money coach, using AI that can learn your spending habits and advise you on how to spend your money properly.
