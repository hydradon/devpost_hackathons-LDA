                <p>
                    Students commonly share meal swipes, and this app could provide them with a way to do so easily and conveniently. Furthermore, the app provides a more beautiful and powerful platform for all their dining needs. It is also a powerful social networking tool, connecting students to people they may otherwise have never met, through food.
