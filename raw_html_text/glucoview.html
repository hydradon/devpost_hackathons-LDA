                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the past 5 years, people with type one diabetes have gone from having blood glucose measurements 4 times a day to hundreds of times a day, thanks to continuous glucose monitors. Despite the more than 100-fold increase in the amount of data that we have, the ways that we view that data have hardly changed. What's more, when patients want to use the vast amounts of data available to them to make decisions about their diabetes care regimen, they need to discuss it with a doctor - a process which can take months for some patients, if it is available at all.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GlucoView vastly simplifies the process of interpreting CGM data by providing a small set of actionable items that the use can implement, ranging from changing insuling pump settings to setting reminders to take insulin.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GlucoView imports it's data from tidepool blip, allowing anyone with a tidepool account to enjoy a simpler way to interact with their diabetes data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a few clicks, the use can import data from tidepool and have personalized suggestions ready to help them get their diabetes under control.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our goals was to make a user interface that was intuitive, functional, and beautiful. While we knew what we wanted the interface to look and feel like, we were relatively inexperienced at frontend development. However, we overcame this and created an interface that met our design goals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In only 36 hours, we got GlucoView to the point where it can make useful, real-world recommendations to anyone with a CGM.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Almost all of the frontend toolkits that we used - d3.js and materialize - were new to us. We also learned how to parse complicated data to provide simple insights.
