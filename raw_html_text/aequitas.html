                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Aequitas was inspired by college students on a budget. The program in theory should allow  users to budget based on a list of products that they need.

                    Aequitas was written in C# with a MongoDB backend.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    With no prior experience with MongoDB and a substantial lack of documentation on c# application interactions with MongoDB , It became a challenge to do simple things like even connecting to the database.
