                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was to create a web application that has the ability to judge all the text based on what it says and to judge the tone of the words. From here, we could do something about filtering out the bad messages. We were able to judge the tone of the words using the Indico API. We wanted to use this API to benefit everyone who used our site.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a public forum that allows anonymous users to access it and post and read messages on the forum. From here, they can filter which messages they see based on the tone of the texts. It works by calling the Indico from the server side and storing the result in the database. When messages are displayed to the user, these results are shown.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with the MEAN stack. We used Angular4 as the client side and Node.js as the back end API with MongoDB as the database
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges when using the Indico API and storing the information in the database. We have to configure out API calls and success handlers to properly deal with the results

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our app being completed on time. We were able to create the web app and deploy it using amazon web services so others could also use it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned just how hard it is to create a full app. We ran into a lot of problems when connecting the parts of this app but learned from the solutions that we found

                    What's next for HackWestern Message Board
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What's next for our Message Board is to try and incorporate using the API into text messages or expanding the board to accomodate more users.
