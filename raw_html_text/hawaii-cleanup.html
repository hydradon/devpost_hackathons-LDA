                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hawai&rsquo;i i is the most beautiful state and yet there is a large collection of trash scattered around the islands. This trash is washed up onto shore or simply scattered around town. It could take up to weeks or even months for this trash to be located and taken care of.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to make the process quicker by giving access to clean up groups or just good samaritans the location of various trash uploaded by anybody. We will create an iOS app with a news feed (clean feed) that people can post to with an image of the trash they saw and the location of where it is. When somebody cleans up the trash, all they need to do is click on the post and click done and that post will be taken off the feed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A similar concept is a facebook page called, Stolen Stuff Hawai&rsquo;i that has over a hundred thousand likes. On this page people post their stolen items and people will actually look out for those stolen items and help take care of our ohana.
