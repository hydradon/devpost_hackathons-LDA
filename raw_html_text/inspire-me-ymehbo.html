                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mostly wanted to learn how to create a skill to begin with. The idea for this project was because I felt this could help boost someone's morale when they may need it or even just to start their day with a good attitude.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This skill will give you a random inspirational quote.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built off of the fact skill template using node.js
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most challenging part was hand picking quotes that I felt had value.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's easy to work off of the templates that the developer kit includes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Inspire Me
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrate with an api to include a wider selection of quotes, maybe also adding category specific selection.
