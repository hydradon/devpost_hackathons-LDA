                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Taking attendance in class can take a while, especially with students constantly moving around, making it very hard for a teacher to take attendance. It might seem only a fraction of the class time, but once the time wasted taking attendance starts stacking up, it's not hard to see how much time was spent on attendance. This is why we made Autotendance, a tool that reduces the time spent on attendance with an automated system, giving more time to spend in the classroom learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Students scan their ID barcodes through a scanner, and that machine takes in the student's ID number and inputs it into the system, marking them present. This makes the attendance process much quicker.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used java, swing, and dweet to create the software that checks which students are present. We used html, javascript, and css to create a simple website that allowed students to input their ID numbers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although we found some codes for a barcode scanner, we were unable to implement those codes to make them connect to dweet and the rest of our software. This forced us to use a website where students input their ID numbers rather than a barcode scanner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were proud of the software and websites that we made. Creating these took quite a while, which makes them things we are very proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During this hackathon, the four of us were able to expand our knowledge on computer science and programming. Using a variety of languages, we also learned many language specific pieces of knowledge. This allows us to implement these new methods we learned in the future, making us more productive programmers
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Autotendance
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we could definitely implement the barcode scanner as we originally were going to do so. Also, we could build a scanner in the classroom that would allow students to swipe their ID cards, making the process even faster.
