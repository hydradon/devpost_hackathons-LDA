                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a game with fun, easy to learn gameplay along with teaching the 101s of security. Looking at chrome's dinosaur game, we wanted to draw in the simple controls along with continuous progression whilst also engaging the user to think about computer security and the types of attacks that a computer might encounter.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You play as the 'Firewall Fighter' tasked with scanning incoming data packets for potential threats. You are limited to 3 actions: rejecting a packet that you think is malicious (spacebar), speeding up the flow of data (right arrow) or slowing down the flow of data (left arrow). 
You lose the game by letting a malicious packet through or erroneously flagging 3 innocent packets as malicious.
The game progresses in difficulty by adding more types of malicious attacks to recognise and increasing the number of items in a packet with your score increasing whenever you make the correct decision.
If you lose the game by letting a malicious packet through then you get a summary of what the attack was. For example, in the case that the packet contained a virus then the user would get a summary explaining what a virus is etc. In this way we can teach the users what the basic types of computer attacks are.
You can use your limited 'stamina' to slow down the flow of incoming packets. Your stamina will recover when not used or recover at 1.5x the speed when manually speeding up the flow of incoming packets.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build this whole project from scratch in Unity and exported it to a WebGL application. After a long brain storming session we settled on a design and initially split off to work on the user interface and the core game logic. Once we were ready to start merging the two, all the team members rotated flexibly around tasks to polish off the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge that we ran into was the algorithm for randomised placing of items in a packet which would ensure that items don't overlap excessively (making the game unplayable). We finally settled upon a rejection sampling method.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team, we're really proud of being able to deliver a full game in under 24 hours that fully aligns with our initial design and goals. We believe that the game is simple but engaging and informative with a welcoming retro theme and are very happy with the end product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we've learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've all learnt how to create 2D games in Unity including skills in 2D graphic design, animation and also Unity's 2D specific functionality (e.g. using sprites, masks etc...)
Herby learnt how to code in C# and how to use Unity, both of which he's never done before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Firewall Fighters
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ultimate goal for this project was to create a game that could be played offline on the Avast Secure Browser. Ideally we would love to integrate the game into the browser, however failing that we would like to release the game either as a mobile app or a playable, online game.
