                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's 10:00 PM, November 3, 2017. We sit in Norris University center at Northwestern University at the start of WildHacks 2017. We brew over what we're going to build in 36 hours...
                </p>
                <p>
                    "You have iPhone but a Windows computer. I have an Android but a Mac. What can we do?"
"..."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "You want to build an Alexa skill?"
"Sure."
"What will it do?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    ...3 hours later...
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I found an API that finds Trump Quotes. I'm going to try to see if I can do something with it."
"Okay."
                </p>
                <p>
                    And our idea was born.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It pulls (dumb?) Trump quotes from an API called Tronald Dump...So if you feel like being inspired you can use this? But also (and the more likely use case), you can use this to laugh at the strange things the president of the United States has said.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it through the Amazon Developer Console.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neither of us was really here for a majority of the hackathon...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got a thing done. We got our feet wet in the world of Alexa skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Do your homework before the hackathon and don't schedule film sets during it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Donald Trump Quote Collector
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will learn how to create our own API through scraping so we don't have to rely on other people's, which would greatly increase the freedom of what things we can accomplish.
