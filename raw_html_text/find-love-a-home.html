                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the recent turn of events from the 2016 election, that could prove to be dangerous to certain LGBTQ+ individuals across the country. We wanted to created a way for those in danger to seek help from other members of their community and their allies, who may be able to extend a hand to them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows users to post their situation in an effort to crowdfund for certain resources that could place them out of danger. It also provides some general resources, such as hotlines for LGBTQ+ individuals if they have no one to turn to in their local area.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Time constraints and lack of sleep
                </p>

                <p>
                    Expanding the website in order to actually help out certain individuals who may not have the proper resources in their area. Probably making an app for people to quickly donate to those who post on it.
