                    My team disintegrated, I have no experience building web applications. So it was hard to even start!

                    I stayed and participated instead of leaving. I talked to a mentor and asked for suggestions to get started. I got it partially working and will continue working on it.

                    bunch of things. I want to get database connection working. Then add messages submitted by the user to the database. Then retrieve messages from the user at random. Then deploy the web application. One thing I am interested in is.. someone suggested how can I moderate what people submit as they could also submit bad words. I will look into some natural language processing that can filter out bad words.
