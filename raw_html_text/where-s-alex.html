                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With Christmas coming up, I wanted to make a Christmas skill where one would guess where Santa is on that day. 
I also wanted to make a daily use skill, where the user would be encouraged to come back. I wanted to develop something different from a trivia game and target people who like quick games, which they could do before going about their daily activity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, the Santa idea fell through because it was deemed a kids skill so I amended it to be a non-seasonal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Where's Alex is a game where the player needs to find out which country Alex is in. Alex will give a clue based on the nearest landmark. If the player guesses correctly, they have a chance to earn bonus points by guessing which city Alex is in as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After 7 locations have been completed, the player is then upselled to get access to more landmarks and countries Alex could visit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I developed Where's Alex using the ASK-CLI, Alexa SDK, AWS Lambda, S3 Bucket, DynamoDB, Alexa Presentation Language and Node.JS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally I wanted to make this a Christmas skill where one would need to Find Santa and guess which country he's in. The reason I chose to do Santa was to target the seasonal market since Christmas was so near but it was deemed as a kids skill despite the questions not being aimed at kids. I didn't have time to cater the skill as a kids ISP, so I changed it to Where's Alex and removed all traces of Santa and Christmas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During development, Alexa was having voice recognition difficulties with cities. I knew this would cause a lot of angry, frustrated users if their answers were not being recognised. To tackle this issue, I enabled the confirmation dialog but during testing, the confirmation dialog would only allow a maximum of 2 confirmations and would end the session after that. This is not a good user experience, so I made my own confirmation intent, which would allow the user to keep trying until they were satisfied with there answer.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was a skill I really enjoyed developing. I thought the concept was exciting and would be a great way to learn about the world and all the beautiful places you could visit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Where's Alex has allowed me to try out a different ISP approach. I am looking forward to seeing if this ISP approach is a good model for future ISP skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Where's Alex
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add images of the landmarks into the game as that would aid the user on working out where Alex is.
