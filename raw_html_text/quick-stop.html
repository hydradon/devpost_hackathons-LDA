                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a game for the longest time, but never got  the chance to do it. Now, with this hackathon, we finally did it!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game is simple. The object is to stop the wheel when the arrow is on the black part. You do, get a point. you don't, try again.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Corona SDK and Lua to develop this app. It was surprisingly easy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At one point, we couldn't get the wheel to rotate, and making the button was a challenge in itself.
                </p>
