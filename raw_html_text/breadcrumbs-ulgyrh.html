                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main inspiration started when we were in Massachussetts one looking around for good food. Not knowing about the area, we decided to call up our sibliings to figure out a nice place to dine at. During this time, we had then intiallty came up with the idea of creating an app to share our past traveling experiences with our relatives.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app allows for users to pin point on a map locations that they want to save for later access. The pins would be stored with a name for the location and a description to allow for the user to add comments.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulty setting up AWS at first to deploy the application, although we got the database working.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about how to use OAuth for authentication, which was previously a challenge for us.  We also learned more about Javascript.

                    What's next for Breadcrumbs
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With Breadcrumbs we hope to add to it the capabilities of creating private and public groups, as well as creating a chat service that can sit with the application.
