                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was to build something from our childhood memories and apply what we know now as college students, and bring those memories to life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given an image of either Turtwig, Chimchar, or Piplup, the machine learning program will return what it thinks the image is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the fast.ai library, we created a classifier that will take pixel inputs of a given image and return the probability of it being one of the starter pokemon. We created our training data set from Google images, and a validation set from 20% of those images. We from those inputs and random parameters, we created our neural network.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating our training data from Google images meant that our training data was not going to be 100% accurate, so it would cause some error when training our neural network.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Putting together something from our childhoods as a team with our currently knowledge and skill set was impressive and nostalgic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've strength our knowledge on how machine learning algorithms operate, and manipulate our data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Machine Learning Pokemon
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Possible creating more classes for different types of pokemon, and creating some type of live video feed as input for our data.
