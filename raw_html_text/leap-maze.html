                    A follow the wire challenge using  LEAP Motion
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Points are assigned based on the color you are on, with the most points gained for being on the black, fewer for the orange, and points are lost in the red. Using your pointer finger as a controller through the LEAP Motion, the code is designed to detect the color the circle is on. This is barely alpha; in future versions I would like to fine tune the color detector, make the image larger and more complex, and add movement and time requirements.
