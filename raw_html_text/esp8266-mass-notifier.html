                </h2>
                <p>
                    Those life-alert buttons you always saw on TV. For those you had to pay a monthly subscription to the service which made them incredibly expensive to have. My goal for the project was to build roughly the same thing for less (it's &lt;15$) that gave you the ability to post custom messages on sms and almost all social media platforms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When pressed it pings a specific url. IFTT then reads that URL and triggers multiple events "applets" via webhooks. I configured it so that when pressed it sends a text message to friends, creates a tweet on my Twitter account, and updates my Facebook status. Theoretically you can link it up to anything IFTTT comparable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using an ESP8266 board along with a set of Neopixel. For software I used Arduino IDE and IFTTT. The entire thing was constructed with the help of many diet Cokes and coffee.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was originally planning to have the ESP8266 use TUguest as a WiFi access point, however because of its portal I had to resort to connecting the ESP8266 to a mobile hotspot I created with my phone
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of the fact that I got this to work with the IFTTT API. I'm also proud that I managed to send text messages with the device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to operate Neopixel using the FastLED library as well as well as how to use the ESP8266 with IFTTT
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ESP8266 Mass Notifier
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next up is powering it with batteries so that it can be wireless and not tethered to my laptop for power. Aside from that I plan to add the ability to decide specifically what services you want to trigger via a switch on the device.
