                    <em>
                        "Hmm... What could we do with a set of accident data and an API which provides local business information?"
                    </em>
                    <br>
                    We came up with this idea because it is a light hearted way to provide user-related information (and some humour) about accidents around their desired destinations. Hopefully with this project, users are able to make a more informed decision with the information we provide to them.

                    <li>
                        After selecting the two businesses you want to compare, their locations are used in the CDL Elasticsearch query to get the accident data

                    <li>
                        We then process the return data to calculate an estimated road accident risk rating for each of the businesses selected before. Criteria used in the process are: Year of Accident, Accident Severity, Number of Casualties and Number of Vehicles.

                    NOTE: Website is not fully functional because CDL has stopped hosting the data with elasticsearch. Will try to get the data and host it ourselves instead. :) Mean time, you can still search up businesses with the Yelp API.
