                    I went to the amazon Alexa developer day in London and wanted to start building a simple skill straight away, so I decided to start building an animal sounds skill. The skill was surprisingly popular:
                    <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hugo-Animal-Sounds/dp/B0765D7LGZ" rel="nofollow">
                        https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hugo-Animal-Sounds/dp/B0765D7LGZ
                    </a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I got an email about the competition and I decided to create the quiz for the animal sounds skill.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The skill takes ## Inspiration from the classic animal sounds toy you get when you are a kid:

                        https://www.amazon.com/Fisher-Price-B7593-The-Farmer-Says/dp/B0000E2DJD
                    </a>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The animal sounds quiz skill challenges the user to identify the animal from the sound Alexa plays. The skill has 3 difficulty levels. I decided to do this as some of the animal sounds are surprisingly hard to know, I hope this will help the youngest kids on the easiest levels and give older kids a challenge on the hardest levels.
I hope the skill will help children learn about the real sounds animals.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main animal sounds skill has been improved to include images of the animals for echo show and echo dot and also show card images, which I hope improves the visual experience. When the children's category is released in the UK and other countries I will improve the visual experience for the quiz and integrate the two skills so when the user has used the animal sounds skill a few times it will suggest trying the animal sounds quiz skill. I will also be adding more sounds to the skill as users request more sounds.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Node.js, Alexa SDK, Lambda and S3
I built this skill in my spare time after work. I have now quit my job and I am traveling (I still have my echo dot in my rucksack (lol) and I am improving skills and submitting more skills as I travel).

                <p>
                    Having no other friends that code to ask questions about Alexa and the SDK. Luckily I made a couple of friends at the Dev day in london who are happy to help and give feedback. When I return from traveling I plan to attend more Alexa events.

How great AWS is.
A better understanding of callbacks in javascript.

                    Extra note
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because I am not in the US I can't seem to find the listing of the skill so I have only included the main animal sounds skill in the link. Maybe you can find it when you search for animal sounds quiz.
