                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are times when classes don't allow for computers and also times where you forget to bring your computer. Situations like these would result in you needed to hand-write your notes then needed to retype them to a online document. We want to make the process easier for people like us.
                </p>
                <h2>

                <p>
                    The user uploads a photo which then we use Google Vision API to translate image to text.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into were incorporating the API and figuring out a algorithm to correctly read boundarys for different handwriting

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can use Natural language and Machine learning to better determine messy handwriting
