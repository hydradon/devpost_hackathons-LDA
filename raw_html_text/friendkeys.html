                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project is inspired by an application called multeor. It is an application that allows you to use your mobile device as a controller for an online game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can choose 1 of 4 controllers and play music along with your friends
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we created samples of instruments and put them in to small mp3 files. we utilized the firebase api to create calls and pulls to transfer the data to and from the server. Through doing this, it does not matter what type of object you use to play the instrument. The instrument pushes a data packet to firebase, firebase then pushes the data to the player file.
                </p>
                <h2>
