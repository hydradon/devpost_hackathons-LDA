                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by street children who need help on a daily basis. Anyone in the world can see them, this was hard to implement as they don't have one place to stay, hence Refugee VR as refugees need help and they are constantly situated in one place.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Refugee VR displays information about a specific refugee camp. This information includes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Basic information about the camp, e.g. location, when it was established, the current population, what's most needed by refugees.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The situation at the refugee camp, that's how the refugees have adapted to the environment
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A video to explore the refugee's situation
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A way to link users around the world with the help on UNHCR
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used react360 library to develop the whole system. I tested it out on the web and it works fine although it ain't in the completion stage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I didn't find any 360deg videos or images for refugee camps
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Time Constraint, as I knew the challenge late
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can find information about one refugee camp currently and this is somehow helpful
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I took this project as I was leveling up on react360, it has helped me to understand its concepts and implementation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Refugee VR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Linking up with the google map API, preferably google street view API, so that users are able to select the tagged refugee camps around the world and view its information
                </p>
