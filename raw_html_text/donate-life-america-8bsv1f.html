                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sharing is Caring. Share a kidney and save a life. According to United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS), approximately 75,000 patients in US are awaiting a kidney transplant.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With a simple press on the app icon, users will be able to complete an initial assessment as a donor or a recipient and schedule a PRA test. Users can select their State in the start up page. Choose their role: Donor or Recipient and complete the initial assessment form and schedule a PRA test. Recipients will be able to include their personal story in regards to their need for a kidney. These stories shall later be used in the app's landing page. (Side note: I actually wished LM supported upload of .jpeg files so that the Recipients could attach their picture, family pics etc.)

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I started with multiple forms like the Select State, Donor or Recipient, Donor Assessment form, Recipient Assessment form and Success. I added a table rule for the selection of State to avoid the gruesome task of entering all 50 States. I then created a the flow by adding activities for all forms in Processes. The app also has a age restriction for Donors and no such restriction for Recipients. There are several required fields in the app such as Donor/Recipients Name, Address and Contact No. for agents to confirm the information provided by the users and follow through the process of Saving Life in America.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming up with a user-friendly approach was a challenge. I did not want the app to have never-ending list of questions for generous Donors and in need Recipients. This app shall serve more like a first step towards the whole process as a Donor/Recipient.

                <p>
                    I always wanted to build my own app and it has finally happened. I have 2 more app ideas that I want to continue building on LM.
