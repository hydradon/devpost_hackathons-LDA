                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Too many times we've found that English is just too limiting a medium for communication. There are ideas that there are simply no words for. That's where we got the idea for Word Generator.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Generate novel and completely unseen, but totally believable words using an LSTM-RNN.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an implementation of an LSTM-RNN in Torch and Lua trained on a massive 1.2 million line dictionary from gutenberg.org
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Training on a CPU was incredibly slow. But we eventually made progress. Also, preprocessing data was a big challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating really interesting words such as "Encyarorous," "Ravor," or "Rascterate."
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    RNNs are really powerful!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Word Generator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Generate names for startups! Or generate names for fictional characters.
