                    We wanted to create something that would take advantage of the current state of the digital society. We realized that cryptocurrency and online media platforms were the big thing at the moment and we really wanted to take advantage of the current buzz. We decided to develop a way to gather data from online sources from past and present, feed it through a machine learning algorithm, and predict the most profitable cryptocurrency to mine at that given time. Throughout the process, this involved setting up a server on a domain, a cryptocurrency pool located on a virtual machine, and an AI hosted on a different virtual machine so as to not take any processing power. The scope of our project grew significantly throughout the hackathon but we are proud of everything we have accomplished.
