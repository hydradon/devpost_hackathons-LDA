                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We like coding and we've been teaching ourselves how to do it. We've just gotten into it and the challenges revolving around finance seemed challenging to us!! So we decided to try to tackle them.
                </p>
                <h2>

                <p>
                    The user chooses a financial topic they want to learn about. Once they select the bubble, they are redirected to a different page which will present 5 questions. Depending on their score, resources will be recommended to aid their understanding of the topic they selected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python and html.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning more about python, flask, templates and html was a little challenging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to learn a LOT about python in a very short period of time and we are very happy with that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Flask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Learn about Finance!!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to include more code to make sure our Finance Quiz functions the way it is supposed to. Students in high schools (where finance classes aren't offered) could use it to learn about finance in order to be more prepared for the real world. Adults could also use it when they feel like they're struggling with financial topics.
