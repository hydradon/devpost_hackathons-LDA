                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming up with a new feature that helps automate the full delivery cycle for CD.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Automation of test case execution using the JTAF framework(but not limited to) followed by automatically adding comments to JIRA tickets. This is to help determine/track the status of test cases(pass/fail) and provide transparency on the project test status, thus enabling decision making for proceeding with newer deployments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created JAVA classes that implement the JIRA Rest API to communicate with JIRA and update comments on tickets.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Figuring out the JIRA Rest API syntax. 
Automation of updating other fields in JIRA(status, assignee), determining how to communicate with individual test cycles.

                <p>
                    We submitted a project for our first Hackathon

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    -How the JIRA rest API is used and communicates with web applications and how they are platform independent.

                <p>
                    Communicating with individual test cycles in JIRA to update the status of the test cases that were executed as part of the cycle. 
E-mail notification for failures.
