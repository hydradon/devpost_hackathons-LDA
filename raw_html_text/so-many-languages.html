                    Inspiration

                <p>
                    Our team consists of 3 developers and all of us realised that we face the same problem- it's very hard to memorise all syntaxes since each language has its own different syntax. This not only causes confusion but also takes up a lot of our time.

                    Other than the jet lag we still have from travelling all the way from India and hence lack of sleep, we came across a few technical challenges too. Creating algorithms to convert PHP code wasn't very easy at first, but we managed to pull it off in the end.

                    Creating a one of its kind product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    1) We are the first ever educative technological assistant to help learn and migrate to programming languages while also giving users a platform to practice and test how much they learnt using language specific problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2) We also help users completely convert one language's code to another language's code accurately within seconds.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our team's first international hackathon. We met hundreds of inspiring coders and developers who tried and tested our product and gave their views and suggestions which we then tried implementing. We saw how other teams functioned and what we may have been doing wrong before.
We also each learnt a technical skill for the project (Akshat learnt Animations and basics of Flask, Anand learnt using IBM Watson to its greatest extent and Sandeep learnt PHP just to implement it into this project).

                    We intend to add support for more programming languages as soon as possible while also making sure that any upcoming bugs are rectified.
