                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to get involved in a way that would be a positive contribution to society while still creating something new and unique.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website/Twilio/mobile app is an informative platform helping people understand overdoses, how to treat them, and where to find help.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a mobile app using Swift on iOS, Flask (Python) with HTML and CSS for the web application, and Flask + Twilio to create the emergency texting service.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a map of nearby facilities for rehab/treatment proved very difficult as the Google Maps API was far more complex than anticipated. Additionally, the iOS app became hard to successfully design and keep functionality.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're very proud of what we learned and what we managed to put together. Although the application is not complete we still feel that we were successful in
                    <em>
                        AT LEAST
                    </em>
                    starting something that could potentially help thousands of people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned many new technologies (Flask, Twilio, Swift, etc...) along with project management skills and collaboration.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We may consider finishing the project if we have the time and seeing if anyone finds it useful, but for the moment it certainly was fun.
