                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    UMaine is very environmentally conscious. We have the Green Team! As individuals we want to reflect the same values as the school we attend and encourage others to do the same. We believe that the Earth can be a better, and greener, planet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every step on the path to this goal starts with the individual. Ultimately this app aims to give the individual more power over their influence. We are empowering others be the change they wish to see in the world. We want to make our planet better by making people better.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app provides a communal space that supports environmental action. This app provides users with a news feed, leaderboard, profile, and challenges. Each of these functions promotes users to inspire, or be inspired, by others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The news feed facilitates sharing recent thoughts and activities with others. This allows people to share their experiences and engage with each other.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The leaderboard gives users access to friendly competition. This applies gamification to a tangible goal: a greener planet. Users can earn points and compete to be the greenest member of their group.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The profile allows users to express themselves around others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenges give users incentives to perform eco-friendly tasks.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a LAMP server with node.js installed. This integrated with an iOS app that was built using swift.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how difficult it is to build every aspect of a application in a very short period of time. We also learned that establishing thorough product design ensures the ability to rapidly create an excellent implementation.
