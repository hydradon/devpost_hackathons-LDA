                    We wanted to try writing code independently. Also it was our first time writing code with no guide from comments/prompted instructions. Up until now we only knew how to solve apcsa questions but we've never written our own code. We're probably going to go to more hackathons during our college years so we might as well start here. We made an arraylist for each anime object. Each anime object contains the title, list of genres, and short description. We were challenged by what we were going to do with each java class.  Initially we were going to create an android app with android studio but time was too short to learn it as we spent most of our time figuring out how to organize.The thing we're proud of for our project was how easy it is to add additional anime objects to the code. From this project, we learned how to filter from a list of objects by their attributes.
