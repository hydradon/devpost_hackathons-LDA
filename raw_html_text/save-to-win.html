                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to develop a children&rsquo;s mobile banking app to promote saving to younger children by giving them an incentive by rewarding them with tradable &ldquo;cards&rdquo;
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An application that will not only teach children the benefits of the importance of saving money, but also gives an incentive to continue saving by rewarding the child with &ldquo;monster cards&rdquo; that could be tradable via QR code between other people. Also, this could be used for adults to reduce the anxiety or stress of opening a bank account.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It&rsquo;s still in development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The difference in skills and the implementation of our ideas.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We worked and communicated as a team to develop an app that could change how children see currency. Also we evenly delegated work evenly amongst each other. The same concept could be used for adults to ease the anxiety of opening their bank account
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We still have a lot to learn about developing, and will continue to strive to become more proficient each day.
                </p>

                    What's next for Save to win
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Continuing the development of our app to where it is presentable to other banking companies, we believe this is very beneficial to everyone.
