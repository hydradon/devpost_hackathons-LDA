                    A problem that many students currently face is not having anyone to sit with when they are at dining halls. &ldquo;Never Eat Alone&rdquo; addresses this problem by allowing users to see who is currently eating, and where. This way, they can find friends and thus always have someone to sit with in the dining hall, caf&eacute;, etc. I learned a considerable amount about iOS app development throughout the process. For example, I learned how to set up my app&rsquo;s backend using Firebase to authenticate users and to store and retrieve information about every user to create a social network.

                    Built with Swift, and Xcode. Used Firebase as the backend of our app.
