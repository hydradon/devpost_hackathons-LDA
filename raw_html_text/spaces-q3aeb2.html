                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Parking has always been a significant challenge in terms of finding the right spot along with the right price. We also noticed that many people had driveways and parking spots that were left unused. The answer was right there - connect parkers with the best spots for the best prices. The owners of the driveways also benefit from additional income for doing virtually no work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A platform to connect "spacees" (parkers) with "spacers" (driveway owners). Simply add your driveway to the database to be listed. Spacees can then review the map to identify the best suitable parking spot for them. Contact information and a transaction system is built in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized HTML5, Javascript, Google Maps API, Firebase, BrainTree API, along with a .co domain.
                </p>

                    This project has been supported for its uniqueness and will likely become a side project born out of Hack the North 2015!
