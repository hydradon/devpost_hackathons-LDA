                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by our love for mazes
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Infinity Maze is a 3-Dimensional Maze with Two Levels. The UI is inspired by RoseHacks's theme.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Infinity Maze was built using the Unity Engine as well as C# for scripting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All four of us team members had no prior experience with Virtual Reality. To complete this project, we learned how to use several new technologies such as Unity for Game Development and C# for scripting. We faced several problems such as enabling a 180 degree flip of the maze, implementing adequate lighting, and creating the actual design of the maze.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Completing an entire Virtual Reality project within 24 hours with no prior experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teamwork makes the dreamwork! We divided roles well. Also, organization is key.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Infinity Maze
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would love to apply the concept of Infinity Maze to a multilevel game and bring it to the VR game market. We would like to implement a maze in which all four walls contain a maze and more frequent flips occur. Additionally, we would like to explore concepts of distorted gravity.
