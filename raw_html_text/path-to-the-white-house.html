                    Inspiration- I had done a similar type of program in the past, and thought it would be fun to take a satirical look at the election through the lives of the candidates.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does- You choose between Hillary or Trump, then go through a day with them, in an attempt to be elected.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it- I wrote it in Java on BlueJ. It is mostly comprised of loops and if/else statements.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into- Eventually it became hard to think of new story lines,
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of- I think it may be one of the funniest programs I've worked on.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned- This election provided so much to make fun of.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Path to the White House- I may add third party options to play as.
