                        NOTE:
                    </strong>
                    This application is still an unfinished project because we faced difficulties with combining 2 major sets of code. It is not finished, and will continue to be a work in progress after this event.

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As grade 11 and grade 12 students, procrastination is something that is very familiar to us. In order to combat this weakness, we decided to create an application that incites the user to stay productive using growth incentive. By creating your own garden full of flowers and by being rewarded with a flower every time you achieve a goal, users would be encouraged to make better time management decisions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application creates a list of all the processes done by a computer (i.e. specific programs that were gone on such as the mail app or the iTunes app). It also records the duration of time spent on a specific program/process. Using this information, the program outputs suggests goals based on how much time is wasted on each program. If a certain goal is met, a flower is added to the garden.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program was coded in Java using the Eclipse IDE. A combination of JFrame and JPannel were used to display our graphics. We also used the ActionListener interface and the ActionEvent method with the graphic user interfaces.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we encountered were as follows:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Thinking of an idea
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Finding a way to organize large data lists
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were quite happy that we managed to use JFrame and JPannel to create a fully functional display for the user. By being aware of the importance of colour, button size, and graphics, we managed to make an application that is pleasing to look at.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This product helped us to realize the true importance of idea generation and the planning process. Collaboration and communication were other key aspects that we now realize is critical to the formation and development of any working project. We also learned how to manipulate array lists and learned that there is not simply just one way of doing things. For example, Android Studio would also have been an amazing fit with our idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ProductivityPlanter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to eventually have our application be remade using Android studio, as it would be even more accessible on a phone interface. We also aim to include different colours/types of flowers for different goals being met. There should be rarer flowers awarded if a monumental goal was surpassed.
