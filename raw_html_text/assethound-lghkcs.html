                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is my first hackathon
                    <strong>
                        ever
                    </strong>
                    &amp; I am a complete newbie to coding!
That being said, I dreamed big: my original idea was a Tinder-style app for dogs in animal shelters: swipe right to save a dog's profile for later visits, swipe left if maybe their breed isn't for you. Over the course of the night, however, I realized that was
                    <em>
                        much
                    </em>
                    too bold (read: too complicated) for a first attempt, so eventually the app got boiled down to a dog clicker training product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever seen "Dog Whisperer" with Cesar Millan? Much like him, this app aims to train dogs through repetitive action and and an intellectual reward system. Rather than purchasing and carrying around a dog clicker itself, however, this one stores easily on your phone! "Click" for positive behavior and reward with a treat &mdash; eventually Fido will respond with an enthusiastic obedience to the sound alone!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first real attempt and my first attempt
                    <strong>
                        ever
                    </strong>
                    with Swift or app development of any kind! It took a lot of patience and even more trial and error.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I don't really fully understand any coding languages, so I had to teach myself basic Swift commands and seek a lot of mentorship in the process! I also lost my laptop charger halfway through &mdash; this was definitely an exercise in time management!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I MADE MY FIRST APP!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I LEARNED HOW TO MAKE AN APP! I also got my feet wet with Swift and iOS coding!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for AssetHound
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, AssetHound hopes to evolve into Say Yup To the Pup &mdash; the Tinder for shelter dogs.
