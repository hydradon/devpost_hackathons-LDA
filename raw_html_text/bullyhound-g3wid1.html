                <p>
                    Knowing that Twitter and other social network platforms sometimes fail to effectively deal with the worst of their userbase,

                    is trying to fight against; our initial goal was an Android app coupled with AWS/EC2 to parse in real-time tweets with bullying or harassing phrasing and respond to what they are saying to let them know that it wasn't appropriate.

                <p>
                    After discussing and seeing that it was already done at another hackathon, we refined our idea to be more specific to a single twitter user.  Our goal was to design an application that allows for monitoring of a user's tweets and mentions and conceptually a young twitter user, notify the app's user when tweets were sent or mentions were sent and notify; by designing it with a singular user focus allows for more direct engagement of the user to see who is doing the harassing and attempt to fix the situation.

                    How We built it

                <p>
                    We used the
                    <em>
                        Twitter AP
                    </em>
                    and
                    <em>
                        Twitter Fabric
                    </em>
                    plugin for Android to build the application.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The group had very little knowledge of how android worked aside from displaying a web view, so working through a new API while trying to build the application was difficult. We also as a group worked through designing a website to accompany the application design.

                <p>
                    Getting the basic functionality of the tweet views working and parsing the data out in testing was a huge accomplishment for us.
