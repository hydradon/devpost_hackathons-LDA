                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to learn how to make a simple web app with Flask as well as learn how to use APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A user inputs their stock portfolio, indicating which stocks they own and the quantity for each (ex. 5 stocks of AAPL). The website uses current trading data to determine a current day gain/loss amount. Then a happy or sad Spotify playlist is chosen depending on whether or not the user is in the positive or negative for the day, respectively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Flask for the backend and HTML and CSS for the frontend. Flask works with the Spotify API to generate playlists corresponding to the portfolio's daily performance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating user login systems is hard. Also, our team is made up of two non-CS majors, so we learned a lot in the process of building the website! For most of the team, it was the first time deploying a Flask app and using an API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned Flask, Python, web development, web scraping, how to use APIs, Git and GitHub, and teamwork!
                </p>
