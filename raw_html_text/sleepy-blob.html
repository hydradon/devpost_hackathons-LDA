                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We sometimes spend too much time on our computer but we often cannot motivate ourselves to stay offline. We wanted to create a website that helps keep track of the time a user spends offline.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First the user pins this tab to the browser, then the website would be launched every time the browser is launched. For every 100 minutes offline the user spends offline he/she will grow 1 new blob. So the more time the user is offline, the more blobs he/she will have.
                </p>

                    Calculating and keeping track of the time user spends offline.
Displaying and animating our blobs.
