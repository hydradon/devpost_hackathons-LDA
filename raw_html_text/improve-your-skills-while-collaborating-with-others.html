                <p>
                    When first startet, the Application lets you register in the project. After that, you can choose a Challenge/Task from the Display and start the task by cloning it via git. The Application will automatically open the file in the right IDE (Of course from Jetbrains). If you are finished with the Project by a commit, your commit will be evaluated, which will help the application to know what skills you have. When you are ready to do the next task, the tasks, which you are the most experienced with due to your skills will be displayed first.
