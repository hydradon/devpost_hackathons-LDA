                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's part of the huge product I'm building.
With various sources and ways to analyze stock market , the technology today helps us analyze news , tweets , social media sentiments towards them. Though there exist lot of traditional algorithms , it's high time we start respecting the sentiments of the investors/clients have towards a stock. This is highly influenced by News / Media.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One mans loss could be other mans gain. That's one of the key concepts I've seen over and over again in the stock / financial investment Industry. A news , which could be POSITIVE for many , could have a negative impact for a investor. It's highly possible a NEGATIVE emotion towards a company could be leveraged to gain profit for our clients.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It analysis the latest news about the given stock. The API used here is Guardian API to fetch the latest news.
It uses this article to calculate 2 things :
                </p>
                <p>
                    1.Polarization : how strongly polarized this article is. It doesn't matter if it's positive or negative. This is to intimate the client that , that stock is something he should analyze and make his own decision. A highly polarized stock , means there is high chance he could leverage the situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2.Sentiment: this is an indication to the client , another information , to help him decide what sort of a decision he would want to make.

                        Did Technical research on possibility of the turning the idea into working model

                    <li>
                        Decided on API - Yahoo-Finance , Guardian News , Algorithms - Naive Bayes
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Tested each part of the code separately

                    <li>
                        Integrated the product so that the output of Yahoo-finance is fed into Guardian News , whose article is fed into the algorithms to get polarity and sentiment

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Though I initially planned the project based on IBM Alchemy News / IBM Alchemy API , EventRegistry.org news API , they all caused trouble after 3-4 hours , as it restricted the number of possible query per day. So this means , I had to rewrite all of it and decide on a different API.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After doing some research , I settled on Guardian API for news.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since IBM Alchemy API couldn't be used for sentiment analysis - we had to use our own machine learning algorithms for it. We did our research on the various ML algorithms available , then we settled on one that's easier to implement in the given time and also widely used. Then with the test data already available , we tested it with example articles to ensure it's usable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1.Ability to quickly make decision based on availability 
2.Ablity to learn quick and implement solutions
3.Building Teams
4.Effiency in splitting task so that it could be worked on individually
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All great journey starts with one small step. That is to start building it and work on turning ideas into reality step by step.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for StockBae
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a looooooong way to go. This is just the beginning of the StockBae. This is one of the many ways we can predict / gauge a stock would go up or down. This is just one of the many services StockBae is gonna use. In future implementation , we shall start incorporating analysis other social media inputs. We shall also include other traditional stock analysis algorithm. Train the application with all these data to come to a more efficient way of helping clients gauge a possible situation which could be leveraged for high profits and cash outs.
