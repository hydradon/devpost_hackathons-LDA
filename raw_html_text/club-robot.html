                    What does the future of payments look like?
One-Click Payments?
Tap &amp; Pay? Biometrics?
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have all of these things today.
What we envision on the horizon is a 0-Step payment - a "Paymentless Payment", where they don't pull out a phone, tap a watch or even have to speak to authorize the payment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What if you could open a tab by simply walking into an establishment and close it by walking out?
With the advancement of facial recognition software and its synthesis into the NAO Robot we have simulated a Club environment where admittance to the entrance is regulated by NAO, who will recognize the face of a member, connect to a server to initialize a PreAuth transaction through the Vantiv platform, and upon approval will wave the member into the club.
As the member leaves the club their tab will be closed in the same way that it was opened and Nao will wave the member through upon approval.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So what you just saw take place was a glimpse into how payments may look in the near future.
No more pulling out one's wallet or phone; no entry of a loyalty number. Jusy a purely frictionless payment, in fact a seemingly "Paymentless Payment" experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using the Choregraphe interface we utilized NAO's facial-recognition software to build out a system that would recognize myself when I walked up to the store and simulate the opening of a Tab by initiating a PreAuth transaction with a card-on-file payment from my member profile.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next step was to allow NAO to complete the transaction upon my leaving the store. To do this we implemented another string of commands where NAO would recognize me again as I left the store and simulated the closing of the tab by sending a PreAuthCapture for the final amount.
