                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While brainstorming for ideas, our team decided that, while we were interested in building a finance app, we didn't want to take a traditional approach to predicting stock prices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Prophecy uses a machine learning algorithm to determine how the language of news headlines in the past 3 months correlates to stock price changes over the same time period. Prophecy can then make predictions on how daily news will impact a certain company's stock value.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Prophecy was built in Python using multiple APIs for data input and tkinter for the user interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Conceptually, assigning values to words in an article and determining influence on stocks from such words was difficult and caused many difficulties in the building of our project
