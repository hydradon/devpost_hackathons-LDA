                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the popularity of the "Battle Royale" genre in traditional video games (as well as film and literature),
                    <em>
                        Run Royale
                    </em>
                    is our attempt to incorporate the addictive and fun nature of large-scale competition into a physical and health-conscious activity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Widely enjoyed by children and adults alike, we felt that we could utilize the "Battle Royale" format to both encourage non-runners to participate in a communal activity, and provide consistent runners with an added competitive twist to their usual runs. In particular, we believe gamifying
                    <em>
                        rankings
                    </em>
                    to be a good strategy for affecting human motivation - quantifying your own improvement is a sure way to build a good habit!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We hope that
                    <em>
                        Run Royale
                    </em>
                    could become popular with children.
                    <em>
                        Fortnite
                    </em>
                    , the
                    <em>
                        massively
                    </em>
                    popular "Battle Royale" video game, is already ubiquitous among youth. By leveraging a familiar format, we believe
                    <em>
                        Run Royale
                    </em>
                    could positively influence children at a young age, and perhaps even combat childhood obesity in a fun way.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        Run Royale
                    </em>
                    is a
                    <strong>
                        mobile application
                    </strong>
                    . Players can sign-in and be placed into a room with many other runners from around the world. Once enough players have joined, a clock counts down and the match begins.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app tracks
                    <strong>
                        distance traveled
                    </strong>
                    for determining which player is ahead of another. Players not first are caught in the "storm" and have their health tick down with respect to their ranking - those further behind lose health quicker. However, to give everyone a reasonable chance (and to promote user interactivity), players can use
                    <strong>
                        items
                    </strong>
                    . Currently, an item use will knock a player's distance backwards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When a player's health reaches zero, the match ends for that player, and they are given a ranking and some statistics on their performance. The match continues until only one runner remains!
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built
                    <em>
                        Run Royale's
                    </em>
                    server with Node.js and Express.js. The client was built with Javascript and React Native. The server and client communicate using the socket.io library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of the challenges came from unfamiliarity with front-end development and the trickiness associated with even small changes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of many of the smaller details of our app, and the relative polish we managed to achieve in only 36 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of the members of our team were particularly familiar with React Native before this hackathon - we each learned a lot about front-end development.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Run Royale
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next steps for Run Royale would include
                    <strong>
                        added game modes
                    </strong>
                    (team matches, long-distance modes, short-distance modes), a
                    <strong>
                        ranking system + matchmaking
                    </strong>
                    , and
                    <strong>
                        additional interactivity
                    </strong>
                    (more items). We hope to promote interactivity with items that might enforce "events" for a targeted player - a player might have to run at a certain speed for a given time or be penalized. Alternatively, items could provide positive "events" for the user themselves.
