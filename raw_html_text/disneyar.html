                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by Pokemon Go and how they used AR to further their brand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project is an app that uses the camera and AR to draw a disney character on the screen, which you can interact with by talking or taking pictures.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    How I built it
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We used a pretrained model for the chatbot(openai-gpt), and unity for the front end interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges setting up AR in Unity as well as connecting the chatbot model with Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The conversation model works very well and is able to hold real conversations with people. The model is also able to adpot a personality, which we can use to represent different disney characters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about how it's possible to train a conversation chatbot using unsupervised machine learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DisneyAR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to add geolocation functionality to the app, which would allow the game to load different characters based on the phone's gps coordinates.
