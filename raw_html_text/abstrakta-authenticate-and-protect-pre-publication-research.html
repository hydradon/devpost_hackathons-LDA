                    Abstrakta was inspired by our teammate who wanted to protect her conference presentation findings before they were published in an academic publication. This got us thinking about what happens to all of the research and raw data leading up to years before a publication takes place. We decided to build a case for a database that would allow for time stamping (as a way to build history and proof) of incremental work.

                    We learned about XYO, how Meta Mask works, and a deep dive in blockchain.
