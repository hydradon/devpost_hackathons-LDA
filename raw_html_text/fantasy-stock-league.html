                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest ways that investors can improve their confidence and market knowledge is by learning to trade in a risk-free but competitive environment. The common thing between fantasy football users and investors is that they both need to spend time researching in order to be successful. By merging the addicting and competitive aspects of fantasy football with stock market investment, we will create an environment where users are dedicated to researching their investments, and improving their pick strategies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app works similarly to a fantasy football draft, where users take turns picking individual stocks until their roster is filled. They then compete in a weekly head-to-head against another user, and whoever has the highest point increase at the end of the week is awarded a fantasy league point.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was built as an iOS app using Swift. It retrieves stock trading information from the nasdaq api in the form of an xml file which is parsed into a table. There is a rudimentary AI who is the opponent in the absence of another human player.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    multi-threading the data retrieval was quite tricky and I haven't worked out all the kinks. It took me nearly a whole day to figure out how to parse the xml file. In the future I will make the app look cohesive and fix the auto-layout issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to use the nasdaq api was the first time I have ever implemented a web api into an iOS app. I was quite surprised when it worked for the first time.
                </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use a web api to retrieve data. I learned about xml files and how to parse them for useful data. I learned about multithreading in iOS
