                    One in ten American adults do not hold a high school diploma. A big reason for this is because the education system isn't made for students' individual needs. Our innovation that can fix this. The Educational Tracker is a personalized method to figure out what concepts students need help with. In our tracker, we used standard geometry curriculum. However, this project is proof of concept that can be applied to any academic subject. We used python to design the Educational Tracker, utilizing many lists, functions, and if statements.
