                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You use your phone to take a picture of each side of a Rubik's cube. Each image is then processed to find the colors on each side, then run through a Ruibk's cube solver. The solution is then rendered and shown in 3d to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The webpage simply uploads pictures and routes them to an S3 bucket on amazon web services. On there, a lambda function is called every time an image is added that does the image processing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The image processing is done in python using OpenCV. We use edge detection to find the cube face, subdivide the face into 9 segments, then find the average color of each segment. Later, when all 6 faces are collected, we construct a Rubik's cube using this information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The solution is then found using the Kociemba library in python, still calculated in the S3 bucket. This solution is then posted to a url where it is read by the webpage and rendered by three.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using AWS services correctly took a long time. Also, processing the image while taking into account issues like different shot angles, glare, and shadows took a lot of work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The image is processing is surprisingly consistent despite having to deal with very close colors such as red and orange.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the OpenCV library, how to use S3 buckets, and how to interface between a webpage and S3 buckets.
