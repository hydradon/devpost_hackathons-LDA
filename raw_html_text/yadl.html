                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The keyboard is the standard input for coding. Since it's invention in 1868 it has dominated as the primary input medium. Almost unavoidable for many workplaces, it is also a major cause for Repetitive strain injury (RSI). Society is diverse and we are glad to have those among us who struggle using keyboards. Inspired by pen and touchscreen we propose a faster, fun alternative to keyboard coding.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Draw your code, AI will digitize it for your computer to understand!
Our use-case is the creation of a docker-compose file by drawing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example:
                </p>
                <p>
                    You draw:
                    <strong>
                        Triangle
                    </strong>
                    <strong>
                        -&gt;
                    </strong>
                    <strong>
                        Cat
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Leading to:
                    <strong>
                        Project
                    </strong>
                    <strong>
                        push
                    </strong>
                    <strong>
                        to Github
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Done!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our productivity tool is using the Cognitive Services on Azure for OCR. 
We use a flask server for requests and logic. 
For the GUI we use javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The complexity to create a complete drawing language is high. (Imagine designing French from scratch!)
To meet time constraints, we decided to equip our drawing language only with the tools to showcase a constrained use case. Very excited to hear the feedback!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A live demo that gives a clear insight how we enable people with disabilities (or injuries) and how we can ease the workflow of coding.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about web development and Azura's cognitive services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for .YADL
                </h2>
                <p>
                    .YADL (yet another drawing language) is a complex challenge that needs language experts to develop it to become a swiss army knife - handling a wide variety of use cases. A start would be to make an architecture that can be easily extended and covers relevant coding workflow processes. This would turn it from a gimmick into a potentially useful product.
