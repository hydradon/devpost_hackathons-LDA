                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After hours of blood, sweat, and tears, I decided everyone takes this way too seriously and built this in 10 minutes. I also want the &ldquo;Most Useless Hack&rdquo; award.

                    When you yell, the light turns on. That&rsquo;s it.

                    Challenges I ran into

                    I wanted a bigger light but this small LED adds to the uselessness.
