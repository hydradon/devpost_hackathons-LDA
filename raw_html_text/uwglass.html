                    Jobmine has no option for its user to share their coop experience turning every student finding their job as if their are in a black box. Therefore, we think of a platform allowing all individual sharing their coop experience and rating but at the same time keep the whole thing only for university of waterloo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We start with a basic idea, have a feature meeting. Since we only have 21 hours to work on a web platform, we filter out all the basic functional features that can be done in 21 hours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The biggest challengers that we run into is that none of us ever use php with database connection and even setting up the common development environment take a large amount of time, not say about all the learning we have to do alongside the whole hackathon. As we are a group of 1st year student (also 1st time to a hackathon), we don't have much experience to do development in a group cause a lot of version problem. Till to mid of the whole hackathon, we started using github and it is way harder to use than our estimation. We run into a lot unresolvable conflicts and that slow down our overall progress but this plight still help us a lot faster in end of the project development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Absolutely, we are excited for how many we have learnt and looking back just to 21 hours ago, we don't even believe that we can build a web platform that work functionally and the best thing is that we fight till the very last moment, staying up all night.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot web technology, include PHP, CSS and database management, and we kinda understand why jobmine do not get updated after all these years. We find out that continuous communication is a crucial point to get the job done.
                </p>
                <p>
                    UWGlass is not prefect now, we want more, we need more. We want to add interview review, user personal profile, recommendation list for our user... But here we are, this is the first step, this is where we start but it is not where we will end. We really hope that this web platform can help and someday get into all UW students hand. But we will see.
