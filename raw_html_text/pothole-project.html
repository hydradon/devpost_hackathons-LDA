                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this project is living in the City of Denton, where there are potholes everywhere.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project automatically detects potholes through two methods, computer vision and using a hardware based solution consisting of vibration sensors. It then captures that image of the pot hole and sends it along with a auto-generated report to Texas Department of Transportation. The auto-generated report is auto-filled with the image of the pot hole, and the GPS location of where the pot hole was found. Finally, using sendgrid the python script will send you an email confirmation of the program auto-generated report.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project included a raspberry pi, piezo vibration sensor, GPS USB module, and a logitech camera. The GPS module sensors input data into the raspberry pi. and the pi runs a python scripts that determines if you hit a pot, and if so, it will automatically create and send a report to Texas department of transportation.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having to collect images for the computer vision, so we can create a database for it to compare too. Plus, reading the data from the GPS module was also challenging.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to utilize google cloud computer vision SDK, and how to accuratly read data from the piezo vibration sensor.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Pothole Project
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Utilize more vibration sensors that would be placed on the sides of each wheel to better capture the impact due to a pothole. In addition, to upgrading to camera for better resolution and frames rates.
