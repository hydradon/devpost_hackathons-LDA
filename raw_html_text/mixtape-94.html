                    Through music, I have met some of my best friends, had some of the best nights of my life at concerts and gotten through some difficult times. However, finding music that's not on the radio can be difficult so I decided to create my website to help people find new music. It contains a list of artists, suggestions on underground artists you might enjoy based on pop artists you like, a virtual mixtape with playlists for different moods, tips on going to concerts and charities the artists support.
