                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was looking online a few weeks ago and found that it was possible to make a nintendo ds game! So before coming i downloaded what i needed and the long old process of deciding what to make started untill i finally settled on SNEK TU the new improved snake game!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    it is both one and two player snake game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    i had to learn to use c++ and code it with little to no helpful documentation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    all of them! i have never built a game before i specialise in hardware and robotics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    that it works! i have a working game!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    all of the things, I have built on my knowledge of c++ and learnt how to hack a nintendo ds which i way harder then first expected.
