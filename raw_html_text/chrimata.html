                    Inspiration

                <p>
                    When I see our country's young generation whining that they are broke at the end of the month simply because they are bad at handling small expenditures. However these small expenditures are not small when cumulated they become a burden, so to solve this problem i have my idea.

                <h2>
                    What is CHRIMATA?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Chrimata is basically an application that helps the user to record his small spendings. For example suppose the user bought grocery on 25 august so the app helps the user to store this information in it under the header grocery, and subsequently further spendings can be stored under the same header with a change of date. This conventionally happens in our homes on a piece of paper, but it can be digitalised . The best part of the application is that it helps you store even small spending such as a toothpaste purchased. Since it is a single item you might forget to store it in your paper but you can instantly store in your phone using chrimata,hence you don't miss small expenditure which when cumulated becomes a huge amount on us and the basic reason for us to be broke.Not just this what chrimata offers more is that it helps you to save on your spendings by recommending you cheap deals. Like big bazaar keeps having schemes on its products, those schemes will be recommended to the user based on his activities and interest so that he could save an extra penny on clothes ,grocery and basic necessities . Chrimata stores spendings like haircuts , petrol purchase, car maintenance , small hangouts, purchasing of tea etc under its diverse headers. Well we know what are targeted audiences are ,it is definitely youth, who are new to controlling their spending whether they are college going students or job employees and basically anyone who wants to have ease and use technology to handle his daily accounting on a personal level.

                <h2>
                    What's more in store?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well Chrimata is a very user friendly application in a sense that it will work only on the data that the user gives. Further chrimata will include updates on where can a user invest, mutual funds, share market, or even small investments like SIP's  so that the user can not only save on spending but also make wealth at the same time, like kiliing two birds with one stone , and it all will depend on what user feeds as its savings on the application or might depend on his goal . Chrimata will have the feature to set goals to be achieved in a specific time. This way you can attend a party in the month end by saving for it before hand , and also you wont be stressed about throwing a sudden party as you wont be broke but instead the app will tell you how much can you spend on a party, and what places can fall in your budget.
Well Chrimata doesn't stop here it will keep on to grow even when its users are increasing and even when we do face our problems.  Since it is an application the costing would be taken care of,  by investors and by sponsors like big bazaar who would like to promote their products on our platform. Collaboration can also take place with apps like grow money and others in order to educate the user where to invest. However one thing needs to be made clear that Chrimata is not a money transfer application instead it is an application to regulate that transfer of money to various parties on a personal level .
