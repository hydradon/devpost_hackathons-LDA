                <p>
                    It uses GPS information to provide navigation. It uses artificial intelligence to identify construction, hazards, and stairs from video feedback. It can then use audio (earphones) and/or visual cues  (Augmented reality) to tell/show the user navigation and obstacles.

                    Trying to make sure your idea is unique is hard. Also, my original team struggled on deciding what to do and include. I didn't have time to make an AI demo like I wanted to.
