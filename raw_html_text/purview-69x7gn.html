                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created this application in the hope of a time and place where people can change advertisements without having to waste paper and labor. We knew we wanted to make something with AR and felt that it would be productive to venture into the entrepreneur side while being able to joke around with memes. We are investing into the untapped market of virtual adspace.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We take user inputted images that are assigned to certain markers and store its information into our database. Users then use their camera to view images in an AR space.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application was coded with Visual Studio Code in HTML, CSS, and React. Our extensions included LiveShare and LiveServer. We built our database with MongoDB and used Amazon Web Service (AWS3) for image storage. Our application is web hosted on Heroku.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with AR turned out to be a much more tumultuous task than we initially believed. The documentation for any working AR functions were too new to be applicable for our vision. We had to separate our application into two pages because the AR camera was not compatible with React. Cameras only properly scanned markers in less than half of our attempts. Due to the strange scan success rate, we had trouble debugging code because we had trouble recreating bugs to fix them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are happy to complete a basic application that consistently functions with AR.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realized that the AR field is not nearly expanded as we had assumed. We learned more about working with coding with camera features. We learned to take and pull data from user inputted files.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Purview
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We envision an application with a consistent success rate for less impractical images (images with low contrast) in hopes of making it more publicly accessible. We hope to improve the UI to make seeing what current images are attached to each marker easier.
