                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Idea &ndash; Next generation wireless networks, have 3 basic requirements &ndash; fiber, colocation &amp; power. Our vision is to build an app that uses the open data available to design a suitable network in a defined geography, ensuring adequate coverage in terms of ideal antenna placement, network usage density, capacity, speed and latency.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app we build, will allow MVNOs to design the optimal physical network in a selected geographical area based on the use cases which will determine the type of equipment they already / wish to use.
                </p>
