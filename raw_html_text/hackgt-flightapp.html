                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improving the customer experience for air travel, in flight with food, and out of flight with ready-to-go Uber rides.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows customers to set their food and drink preferences so the flight attendant know what to offer. Using Delta's API, fud determines the customer's landing location and time, and will schedule an Uber for pickup so the customer can leave as soon as they exit the airport
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML/CSS for the front-end, web development, and python and MySQL for the backend. In order to integrate the python code with our front end, we used Flask, a lightweight framework for linking together html elements with python scripts. For the Uber tasks, we integrated the Delta Flight Status API to get the coordinates and time of the customer's flight so that we can schedule an Uber ahead of arrival.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to connect the python backend and html/css frontend was difficult at first, but after some research, we found that we made a good decision by choosing Flask as our framework to connect our code base from front to back.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating and implementing some of the key features of our app within 36 hours. It's so amazing that we can run from just a small idea into a real life project within such a short amount of time.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to combine a strongly developed, scripted backend with a well formatted, styled frontend. We also picked up on how to integrate and manipulate databases using MySQL.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for fud
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Helping customers be health conscious. By gathering just the customers preferences and orders, based on their physical data, we plan to release a service that recommends healthy alternatives for customers in flights that serve multiple food options.
