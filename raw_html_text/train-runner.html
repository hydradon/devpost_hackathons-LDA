                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, the team and I made a game for IOS / android, and when I started studying Spark AR, the thought came to make a promo version of the game in augmented reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Raner on the locations of the city of Kiev, in particular from real streets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Made using scripts and a Reactive module in a pair, in addition, many 3D models and animations were created (also, using the mixamo.com service)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenge was one of the first to port the classic runner to spark AR on instagram, since we hadn't seen similar implementations yet. In our opinion, this is one of the very first 3D runner mechanics on Instagram.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were one of the first who came up with and developed the mechanics of the 3D runner for instagram. In addition, we believe that very comfortable controls are implemented here - we did not achieve this immediately, but after many searches for ideal mechanics.
As for the concept itself, we are proud to have made game mechanics that really addictive and captivate users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to integrate 3d models into spark AR and how to interact with it using programming and make more complex and interesting games.
A lot of work was also done to develop a pipeline in creating 3D games in a sparky environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for zRada game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is working with a camera, adding dynamics, a storyline. Also in the future, the system responsible for obstacles in the game will be finalized, additional characters, levels, super powers and checkpoints will be added. This will make the game more interesting and addictive.
