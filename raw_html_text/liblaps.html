                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes when we're studying at O'Neill, they run out of laptop chargers and they don't know when they'll be available again! Oh no! This means I have to keep going back to check if anyone returned one. How troublesome!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app allows students to track how many laptops and laptop chargers are available at O'Neill by allowing librarians to input when a laptop or charger is check out or returned. Students can turn on notifications for certain types of laptops or chargers so they know right away when one becomes available. It also lets you know the closest due date of the next available one, so you can beat the lines and check it out right away!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Xcode and Swift to create our single-page based app.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenges were downloading Xcode, learning how to use it, and figuring out many logistics since this was our first time using it.
