                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea originally began as an app designed to test a child's reading and math skills which would then relay the results back to the parent. Eventually, through the brainstorming for Biohack, we spoke of delving into the mental health of the child instead and giving the results to a therapist. This would essentially digitize the process of filling out a questionnaire in the waiting room, removing the need for paper and shortening the response time of the therapist.
