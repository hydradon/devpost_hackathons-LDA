                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Atom, and coded in HTML, CSS, javascript, and jquery.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to code. Plus, even harder things like javascript, comment section, and website links.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a WEBSITE!!!! Three days ago we didn't even know what javascript and CSS were.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything! I mean, really. We learned languages, the workings of HTML and websites, and how to teach ourselves certain coding techniques.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for cage-free sagehen website!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to expand on the site and add more fun things like animated cursors, more linked webpages, improved style, and formatting. In five years, we see ourselves buying the internet.
