                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group was formed at the Facebook Developer Circle Community Challenge Build Day event. We all met each other for the first time at this event, and agreed on building a simple but entertaining game &mdash; a platform that is able to be expanded infinitely. The inspiration behind our game is somewhat self-explanatory; We wanted to create a form of Battle Ground (PlayerUnknown&rsquo;s Battlegrounds), but within a board. Some other inspirations would be Winner Winner Chicken Dinner and Agar.io. The goal was to let user experience the thrill of beating other players in real-time by pushing away their stones on the board.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The user logs in using Facebook Authentication
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When the user presses the &ldquo;start&rdquo; button, the game starts
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The user is able to pull back on the stone to get rid of other players&rsquo; stones from the board through collision. When a player&rsquo;s stone pushes another stone, the owner of the stone that leaves the dimensions of the board loses.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This process is repeated three times until a user becomes the final champion.
Note: Once the stone moves, the stone cannot move again for a short amount of time
                    </li>
                    <li>

                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized React for the development of the front-end, NodeJS for the back-end, and MongoDB to store user data and the tokens. Socket.io was used for their communication. Altogether, we built a HTML5 game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we all met each other at the Build Day event, we were not aware of each other&rsquo;s skills and experience, so it was a challenge at first to divide our roles and parts in the project. We also realized that we all lived in different regions/parts of Korea, and had to use Messenger&rsquo;s Video Group call for meetings, and Github and Zeplin for cooperation / communication in developing the application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game may look simple on the surface, but by defining the game modes, we built a game platform that can be infinitely expanded, improved, and extended via Pull Requests. We are also proud of making a turn-based strategy (TBS) game in real-time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to collaborate on a project with people from different job families and areas. Our team is composed of backend developers, frontend developers, and designer/product manager.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Famous Potato Soup
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe we made a game platform for all, instead of just a game. We&rsquo;ve opened up an environment for anyone to contribute to the platform by creating new game modes using just space and stones (limited resources). One can easily win but also easily achieve fulfillment by playing by various rules that are easy to understand. YOU can also contribute to the game open source by making a new game mode!
