                    Why did we make RandomBot?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a bot which entertains users on twitch. We started off with cat facts, since everybody likes cats. The list of features gradually expanded from there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What is RandomBot?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    RandomBot is a twitch chat bot made purely in html / javascript which responds to a list of given commands. It also reads the text that users send in chat to automatically generate some real-sounding messages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What can RandomBot do?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Supported commands include !cat, !chuck, !chuck2, !dadjoke, !help, !joke, !latvia, !nerdyPickupLine, !number , !pirate , !pokemonPickupLine, !schneier, !showerthought, !subreddit , !talk, !yoda , !yomama.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How do these commands work?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    These commands use various APIs from the internet such as cat facts api and chuck norris jokes API. Some of the other commands such as !nerdyPickupLine and !pokemonPickupLine pull from a predetermined list of pickup lines. The reddit commands such as !dadjoke, !showerthought, and !subreddit  use reddit's random feature to output the title and contents of a random post on a given subreddit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    !talk uses chat messages and a markov chain text generator to create convincingly real text.
