                    Personally, it took me well over a year, to learn about the full potential of the stock market. In addition, I, first dived into an unwelcoming situation when U.S and North Korea are at the height of their tension, war may be imminent. Markets dropped over thirty percent for me. I was at a severe lost. My parent have never invested in the stock market after hearing brutal losses by their family members. I was at an disadvantage in such circumstances as a trader, not knowing all the factors of economics that affected the share prices or shareholders' optimism on their expectations for their companies. My portfolio lost 45% market value; psychologically, felt defeated in the hands of intelligent investors.   However, in 2019, investors and consumers are optimistic that trade war will end and global growth will continue creating higher earnings and market capitalization.

                    We made this app for the novice investors like us who once believed that Wall Street is anybody's game. Like every new pursuit of adventure, we should research and learn and become financially literate and independent. That can begin with Finlit, an application that helps beginner traders experience the stock markets in past times where lesson can be learn of when do risks increase and when do risks decrease.

                    Currently, Finlit is still at it's initial stages.
