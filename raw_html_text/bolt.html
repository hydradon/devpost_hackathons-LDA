                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the recent advancements in many aspects of Artificial Intelligence, such as AlphaGo, self-driving cars, and many other interesting projects throughout the globe. After much research, we discovered that such projects require a lot of training data and related groundwork. Such data and groundwork can be easily crowd-sourced.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Companies, organisations or individuals who require human intelligence work or feedback can upload their tasks to our web portal. Some examples include the labeling of images to train their machine learning models, verifying whether the results of a search engine is relevant to its search term, or to conduct market surveys on their products.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, in order to motivate users to aid such projects, we can allow users to earn money easily through the completion of such tasks and surveys on their mobile phones. As of now, we are targeting image categorization, testing search relevancy, and market surveys. However, this list is not exhaustive and can be further expanded upon.

                        One similar product or service is Amazon's Mechanical Turk. However, what distinguishes Bolt from Turk is the fact that our platform allows users to perform such tasks on the go, while Turk is only web-based. Bolt is designed for one handed use, allowing users to complete tasks, help projects and/or people, all while earning money on the go (e.g. while commuting).

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bolt consists of 3 major components: Website, Mobile Application and Server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our web portal is developed using Mozilla Thimble (i.e. HTML, CSS, JS), powered by JavaScript (i.e. jQuery) and designed using Bootstrap (version 4).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our mobile application is developed using Android Studio, powered by Java and the SwipesView library (

                    ).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our server is set up using Node.js, handling communication between the mobile application and our web portal.
