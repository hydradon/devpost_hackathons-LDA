                    The Immigrant Story
                </h2>
                <h1>
                    Tagline: We are all immigrants
                </h1>
                <p>
                    With the recent rise of populism and desire to break the 'bubbles' that we live in, we created "The Immigrant Story" as a way to unite people and show how many shared experiences we have.  We are all immigrants (and it's easy for people to forget).
                </p>
                <p>
                    After talking to multiple people, we built the site using storytelling and data visualization to achieve the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Telling each person's unique immigrant story
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Showing timeline - Data visualizations showing how we interconnected as immigrants with a timeline of the group that we interviewed
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Showing Commonalities - Data visualizations that show how we share commonalities as members of 'humanity', such as sharing a love for chocolate ice cream. (We're really a lot more similar than we think!)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How can we help you - Members were asked what they might need, including community, legal assistance, volunteer, e-mail sign-up, etc.  Our hope is that we will be able to work with organizations to help individuals on the back-end via anonymous 'craigslist' e-mails
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Creating a community of volunteers - connecting a group of individuals united around the immigrant experience and who are interested in volunteering
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Helping new immigrants - current feature includes legal assistance, which we would like to expand to include job assistance, housing, immigration and citizenship issues
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h1>

                    <li>
