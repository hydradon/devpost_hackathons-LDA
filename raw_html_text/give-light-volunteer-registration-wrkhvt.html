                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Talking to the team at Give Light Foundation, we realized that the current process of adding new volunteers to the database is a very manual and painful process. We want to build a solution which is a delight for both the team at GLF and the volunteers who sign up!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Revamp the volunteer registration and automate adding data to database which was not currently happening. Also added Facebook login to make it easier and faster for volunteers to sign up.
                </p>

                    <li>
                        Next steps for volunteers:
a. Add event management steps (read Restaurant Campaign) so that volunteers can get started easily 
b. Show a list of past events for inspiration

                </ol>
