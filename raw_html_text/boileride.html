                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our members use the Facebook Purdue Ride Share group and we found it difficult to find rides by scrolling through all the posts. The group was tedious to navigate so we wanted to build an app to solve the problem of finding rides in a more user-friendly way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can post rides and can lookup rides that are posted. This makes it easier to connect those who are in need of or can offer rides.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used Django and HTML/CSS/Python to create the webapp and store user data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us knew how to use Django, so we had to find tutorials to understand how to use it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create a prototype of the website and some basic functionality such as user login and the idea of how to post/view rides.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use Django and team communication. How to stay awake while simultaneously code for 36+ hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BoileRide
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on continuing building it to create a viable product. We want to add more functionality such as search function and a map aspect as well as polishing some of the current functionality.
