                    Neighbourhood Watch allows community members to anonymously share incidents (like muggings, attacks, etc) they have been involved in or witnessed so community members can be aware of dangerous spots they should avoid fom time to time in their neighbourhood.

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    I used React to spin up a simple web app and then use open street map api to geofence dangerous spots around the user.
