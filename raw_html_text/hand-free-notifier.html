                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While studying phone calls and messages becomes distraction and to prevent that, it helps to know if checking phone at that moment is important or not.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bulb glows to a specific color based on the incoming call which is either individual or added to a group.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Android Studio, Telephony manager API and Ilumi bulb API

                    Connecting the phone call state (Telephony manager) to bulb to execute at the same time
