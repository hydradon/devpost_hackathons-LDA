                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app is inspired by all the times we sat and looked at our phone during lunch, directly across from someone else who was doing the same, and you just wonder what would happen if you started up a conversation with them but you don't becuase you don't want to upset the social norm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Eat with Me allows people who would otherwise eat alone link up and talk over lunch with other people, based solely on a conversation topic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The frontend was developed in Android Studio. The backend is a CherryPy server with a MySQL database running on an Amazon AWS ec2 instance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time using almost all of the tools we implemented, and our first time linking mobile frontend and serverside backend using REST calls, so there was a lot of back-and-forth on implementation details and debugging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app has the potential to counteract the antisocial trend of the internet age and allow people to make real, human connections that they otherwise would not have made.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When there are two teams working on different parts of the project, communication is very important, even when there is not a problem because one headache for you could be a couple lines of code for them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Eat with Me
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on developing our prototype into a fully functional app for University of Rochester students.
