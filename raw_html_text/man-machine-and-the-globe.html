                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Following the prompt of "Change", we thought it would be interesting to show a form of societal change that occurs thanks to technology while reflecting the negative effects society can have on the environment. In all, it is meant to be a cautionary tale about caring for the environment.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The player moves across a changing environment as the human species evolves.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Unity 2D, we planned out what our goal was and planned the stages along with the progression of the player's characters as they progress through the game. Our artists put together sprites and the environment which we then implemented into the game.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to make level stages in Unity's 2D. Some things that were challenging were making it so the player sprite could be able to move across the environment without falling through the ground.

                <p>
                    Being able to put something together that works, along with using our own artwork in the game.

                    This project is our group's first time working together. Though we have not decided on what to do with this current project after it's completion for the Hackathon, we already have another idea for a game that we could make based off of what we've learned during the Hackathon.
