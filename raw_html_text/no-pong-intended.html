                    Overview: No Pong Intended is the classic 1970's arcade game reincarnated; this time in real life. Using computer vision and a Sphero we are able to control a ball as if it where in a computer game.

                    Implementation: The project makes use of OpenVC to track objects in the playing field (the ball and paddle). Bounding boxes are used to detect collisions between objects. The Sphero is controlled through an API built to bind the Spheros Bluetooth capability to Javascript programs. In order to use this api in our Python based game we communicate via a Node JS socket.
