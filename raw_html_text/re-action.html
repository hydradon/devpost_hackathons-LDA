                    "When it is spent well, humanitarian relief saves lives, feeds people and provides them with essential supplies and services. It should also set the stage for a return to development following conflict or disaster." - publishwhatyoufund.org

                    However, what often happens is that disaster regions often receive a lot of media attention immediately following the disaster(or sometimes no media coverage at all), but no interest in the months following that. This creates a lack of awareness for the global community, which is important as this directly corresponds to the pace at which the regions are rebuilt.

                <p>
                    We&rsquo;ve created a web platform that mobilizes relief workers during times of need.  Our goal is to increase the effectiveness and speed of humanitarian efforts by creating a transparent system where donors can see exactly what is being done and where their donations are going (breakdown of transaction costs). For the first time, donors are able to be more involved in relief efforts. Not only will they be able to contribute financially, they&rsquo;ll be kept up to date on progress, and be able to help spread awareness about the status of relief efforts.
