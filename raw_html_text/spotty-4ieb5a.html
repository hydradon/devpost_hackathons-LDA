                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People who have mobility issues have a hard time finding friends or loved ones if they are in a crowded space. The number of adults unable (or very difficult) to walk a quarter mile: 17.2 million which is 7.3% of the population.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Spot-E is a Remote Control car that can detect and recognize faces. Imagine if you have a loved one who has alzheimer's and visual impairment and you can&rsquo;t find them in a large building. You can send Spot-E around to look for them. Once the user is found by the car, they will drop a GPS signal for where the car is.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The finder will send a message to the user such as, Wait here John, I will come get you in 5 minutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the other hand, if the finder has a disability such as the inability to walk or a visual impairment, it can tell the car to look for the person.
                </p>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Raspberry pi, android studio, python, java, javascript php, azure

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything was a challenge because none of us had worked with cross platform communication channels, android and designing a hardware system
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That this actually works! We came up with better and better design for the hardware.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maintain code integrity across the channels, some channel designs are better than others
                </p>

                    What's next for Spotty
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Incorporating a drone into the device
It will be fully autonomous in the future
