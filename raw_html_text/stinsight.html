                    A Machine Learning project implemented for the Artificial Intelligence Society DataSci '17 competition. The UCI Student Performance Data Set was used to effectively predict if a student is expected to fail the course or not, using school reports and questionnaires. Different classification models were compared. The best model, Logistic Regression achieved about 70% accuracy.

                    1. In which class of problems, does this qualify?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    This is a classification problem. The reason for terming it as a classification problem being, we are asked to identify students who might end up failing the final exam.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus, we need to identify such students and intervene before it's too late. Or in other words, we have to classify the whole group of students into two sections - Ones who are expected to fail the course and others who are expected to pass the course.

                <p>
                    Based on the statistics obtained, Logistic Regression provides the best performance and also in the least time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The other models didn't perform well in comparison with Logistic regression. Though Logistic Regression appears to be a clear winner in both measures used to decide the best model i.e. performance and training and testing time, I would've still chosen to trade off the training time for the higher performance. The reason being that failing a course in school can have some adverse effect on the mental and psychological health of the student, making accuracy a dominant factor in comparing different models.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus, as the predictions need to be very accurate, we would have to value the accuracy more as compared to training and testing time.
