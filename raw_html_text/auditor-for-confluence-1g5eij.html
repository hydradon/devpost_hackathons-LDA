                    <em>
                        Auditor for Confluence
                    </em>
                    solves the problem of the lack of information about past actions performed by multiple Confluence administrators.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today Confluence doesn't provide any sort of audit trail for administrative events. There is no easy way to find out which administrator made which change and when.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Someone deleted a space? Users were added or deleted? Your default look and feel unexpectedly changed affecting all your spaces? An add-on was disabled? A layout was modified for some reason? User's password was changed? Group membership for someone was updated? Somebody changed something, and as a result things don't work as expected? - If any of this happens, you don't know who made the change, when and why.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does

                    <em>

                    </em>
                    is an easily installable Confluence add-on that resolves the problems described above. It tracks all events performed by administrators and stores them in the audit log. Whenever something unexpected happens, you can search the log and see who and when made the change. Knowing that, you can discuss the issue with this person and find out whether the change was legitimate or done by mistake. This makes your work much easier and puts all your Confluence administration under control.

                    After you install the plug-in, audit log can be found in Administration &gt; Audit Log

                <p>
                    For each administrative event the following information is stored in the log:
