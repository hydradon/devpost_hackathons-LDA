                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As first years computer science majors, we had just learned about visualizing data in Mike Scott's CS312 class (some of you might find this familiar). Professor Scott had just showed us the visualization of zip codes all across the United States, and we thought it would be a good idea to put this code into a more relevant topic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shows the geographical relationship between the amount of times people are talking about a certain political candidate and their location. We color code the talk of Hillary with blue, and the talk of Trump with red.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the back end, we gather twitter's data for geolocation of cities and states where we search for specific hashtags relating to Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. We gather the data into a JSON file, and turn it into a JavaScript code.
For the front end, we used a web template from WebGL that would visualize our data into an intuitive and sleek form.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As Computer Science majors with virtually no past experience in any other language other than Java, the whole project was a challenge in and of itself. However, thanks to the help of our mentors ( and CDK Global ), we were able to accomplish this goal while also learning a fair amount of useful information.

                    We've learned about how the web is structured and how servers and computers communicate with each other.
