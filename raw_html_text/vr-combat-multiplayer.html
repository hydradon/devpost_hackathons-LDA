                    We have been working on a title for for some time now, and had recently switched to Unreal Engine for development. Our goal at PennApps was to implement functioning multiplayer with the VR exclusive game. We have learned a great deal over the weekend at PennApps and are exciting to be bringing a demo at the PennApps Expo!
