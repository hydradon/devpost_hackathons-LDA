                            We wanted to use Android Studio to create an elegant app that solves a real-world problem.
                        </strong>
                        There are too many instances where government response is lacking. Take for example police numbers. In many areas, emergency numbers are clogged with numerous and diverse problems outside the skillset of operators. We wanted to solve this problem by creating a platform where communities could report problems that are auto-classified to local government agencies with the correct skillsets to solve those issues.

                    <em>
                        It can be difficult for the government to address local community issues in a timely manner.
Our app gives citizens a direct line to the government to voice issues in the community.
The citizen simply submits a report through the app and an auto-classification algorithm sends the report to the government department that can best deal with the issue.
The app records user inputted data -- what happened and how urgent the issue is.

                    <em>
                        We used Android Studio along with several libraries to create an interactive user interface. The auto-classification algorithm was created in Java.

                        It was difficult to find a way to get the app to automatically send an email. It was also challenging to implement a fully functional Google Map using their API/Library.

                    <em>
                        We learned how to use Android Studio and the fundamentals of Java. We learned how to integrate libraries and modules into Android Studio to increase functionality. As a group, we learned how to split up work equally, manage our time wisely, and adapt to new challenges.

                    <em>
                        In the future, we can implement a fully functional map, and be able to get the location of the report using the GPS. 
We can create a place to submit photos for the report, and add image recognition software to better classify the reports.
