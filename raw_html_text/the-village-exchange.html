                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users submit photos and captions under one (or more) of four categories: Events, Places, Foods, and Other. Athletes can share through words and pictures what they love most about their country and why. For every picture submitted, The Village Exchange sends the user a random picture from an athlete from a different country.
