                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We knew that global warming and air pollution were big problems in the world, and we were eager to solve these problems with an app. Everyone wants to help with the issue&ndash;&ndash; but most don't know how. Our app allows everyone to help out by carpooling more often, which can positively impact the amount of emissions on the road.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app is a safe platform where the user can collaborate with their contacts and set up rides to specified destinations. Just choose your destination,
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into multiple issues with alignment, and also had trouble finding out how to make a button call a given phone number in SwiftUI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of our buttons, which actually work and take one page to the next. The last time we tried coding buttons, it hadn't worked out.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about SwiftUI and how it works, and time management.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WeCarpool
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're planning on making the app safer and having a functional database which actually stores the login info. We also would like to add a sign-up feature and an 'edit profile' button which allows the user to enter information about themselves for their contacts to see.
