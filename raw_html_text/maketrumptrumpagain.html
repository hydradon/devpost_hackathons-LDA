                <p>
                    Trump's statements include some of the most outrageous things said recently, so we wanted to see whether someone could distinguish between a fake statement and something Trump would say.

                <p>
                    We generated statements using markov chains (

                    </a>
                    ) that are based off of the things trump actually says. To show how difficult it is to distinguish between the machine generated text and the real stuff he says, we made a web app to test whether someone could determine which was the machine generated text (Drumpf) and which was the real Trump speech.

                <p>
                    Machine learning is hard. We tried to use recurrent neural networks at first for speech but realized we didn't have a large enough data set, so we switched to markov chains which don't need as much training data, but also have less variance in what is generated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We actually spent a bit of time getting

                    up and running, but then figured out it was actually pretty bad as we had a pretty small data set (&lt;100kB at that point)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eventually got to 200kB and we were half-satisfied with the results, so we took the good ones and put it up on our web app.
