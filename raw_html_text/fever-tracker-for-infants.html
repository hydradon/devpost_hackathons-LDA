                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team was inspired by the experiences of the parents who are taking care of infants with Congenital Heart Defects, Congestive Heart Failure, chronic lung disorders, pneumonia, and bronchiolitis. These conditions take a lot of efforts from parents and healthcare professionals to maintain babies' vitals and prevent the fever. It usually requires hourly temperature measurements rectally, collecting data and reporting it to the doctor. This is important for test selection and decision making. Our device will allow medical professionals and/or parents to keep track of the temperature remotely through a mobile phone application that is less invasive and more informative. Moreover, parents can store and forward data to the doctor using this application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The application of our invention is not limited to infants with chronic conditions and can be used in cases of infectious diseases including flu, measles, rubella, etc. It also will help parents to make a decision about a child's daily activity and regimen.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tracking body temperature of infants 24 hrs/7 days per week, sending data to your mobile phone through a special application, and helping a doctor in the diagnostic test selection, diagnosing, and decision-making process.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with a thermometer, Bluetooth, battery, phone application. This was inserted into a headband.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not have all the necessary materials to create a prototype. Some of the components were there, but they were not always the right model or size (although the ones we needed were available in the market).
We got caught up in the brainstorming session and the selection process was time-consuming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we were able to create a product that has meaning and purpose. 
We are also proud that we were able to integrate such a diverse range of disciplines within one product: fashion, engineering, healthcare, and computer science. Our Fever Tracker is a good example of transdisciplinary efforts that aim to solve a healthcare issue.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to link the thermometer to the mobile phone application, develop the most efficient design solution, and develop a good marketing strategy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Fever tracker for infants
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to make our device for different age groups, produce it in different colors and shapes.
