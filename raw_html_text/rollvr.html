                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a VR game. And the deadline.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a basic VR game made for the Samsung Gear VR. You play as a ball, and you tilt your head to change the direction you're rolling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team built this application with a Gear VR and Unity's C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity is not a fun program, and VR does not have much documentation and support online.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a VR game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to make VR games.
                </p>

                    What's next for RollVR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Polishing could be done, but otherwise, this project was used for experience and learning.
