                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An old xkcd webcomic showing a stick figure doing pull-ups, with the caption, "Like many geeks, I got a lot more interested in exercise once I made the connection to leveling up."
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows you to input the healthy activity in your life, such as eating well, or exercising. An animated character accompanies you on your path, visually acting out the activities you do, as well as accumulating wealth and success as you level up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Xcode and swift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything. This is one of our first hackathons, and we basically had no idea how to use swift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The animations, and the overall design and feel of the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to incorporate animation into iOS apps, how to keep track of fixed variables across different classes, and how to make an app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LevelUp Fit
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing more customization, and allowing different genders and preferences to feel part of the experience, as well as more flexibility in selecting workout stats.
