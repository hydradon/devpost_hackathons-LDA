                    Our app facilitates donations to charity organizations. Such organizations traditionally ask for donations by mail around Christmas season, or in the street with paid or volunteer solicitors. Millennials, highly connected and mobile oriented, are not responsive to such donation requests. Donating spontaneously requires involvement (research organization, assess integrity, create donor account, enter payment information), which millennials are not necessarily willing to commit to. Most of us, however, do see the humane value in giving to charity and would make donations if the process was more simple. Therefore, we are targeting millennials, and more generally 22-35 year olds, recent college graduates and young professionals with average income levels, who want to donate but do not respond to the current donation process.
While our users are individuals, our customers are charity organizations, and we act as a broker facilitating their access to donors. We charge a 0.5% commission on every donation.
Our app offers an easy way for users to browse charities and makes suggestions according to their preferences. Once a charity is selected, a &ldquo;Charity Profile&rdquo; shows basic facts about the organization (size, area of operation, annual budget, etc.), give a short summary of current operations, shows links to more information (organization website) and has &ldquo;Make Donation&rdquo; button. Once clicked, users can select different donation methods: one-time or reoccurring. For reoccurring donation, the user sets how much and how often he wants to give. Once that is done, the donation is live and the user does not have to worry about it any more. The user can donate to as many charities as he wants and can check the status of his current charities in the &ldquo;My Charities&rdquo; page which shows all charities with active donations, and gives a quick summary of how much the user has given.
Annually or upon request, the app sends the user a report of all donations he has made in that fiscal year, which can be used for tax deduction.
