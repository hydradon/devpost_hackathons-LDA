                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A diabetic friend reached out to one of our team members involving his issues logging his blood sugar levels daily. He does not have a continuous blood sugar monitor due to cost. He has tried several apps for logging glucose levels, but they all had problems, such as being too easy to ignore or lacking many useful features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Android app is not complete, but builds a foundation for a long term project to help diabetics. The app will allow the user to record their blood sugar, bolus insulin, and meals to provide historical trends, predictions, and suggestions. The alert feature allows the user to set reminders to check their blood sugar levels on a regular basis, without the option to skip.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio and GitHub to collaboratively create parts of the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us have ever done any mobile development for iOS or Android.
Some team members had very little programming experience at all.
We had issues working with GitHub integration in Android Studio, causing us to use some workarounds in order to collaborate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of learning the basics of Android Studio. We never expected we would get this far!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to do basic design and programming of Android apps, as well as strengthening our skills in Java and general programming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for myBloodBuddy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're planning on completing the application and presenting this as a project at the K-State Open House. After that we hope to release the app on the actual app store and have it available for people to use.
