                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the intuitive matching design behind Tinder and wanted to implement it in our own project. We wanted to create a simple, easy way to find people to play games with.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is used to search for other players that meet your search parameters. You can start a search for players, specify which role(s) you wish to play as, and specify which role(s) you want to play with. You can also choose which game modes to play and which platform to use. If both players swipe right on each other, they appear in their matches page, which displays player name and Battletag.
