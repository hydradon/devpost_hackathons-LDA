                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We always had problems sorting our waste, so we just end up throwing it in the garbage. At least, I do.Today, we are introducing you to the new Goggle Lens feature, that will help you solve this first world problem!

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used JavaScript to mainly host Computer Vision API offered by Microsoft Azure and make sure everything is holding together, while python sorts and compares the data between files and displays it on an HTML/CSS interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As first year students, a lot. Learning to use API was a challenge, mainly because there was an ERROR in the documentation of Microsoft!!! Furthermore, the biggest challenge was assembling everything at the end
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the end, we have a useful web working project that is able to identify and sort local files and internet files. In addition, this can make an impact and we are looking forward to work on it!
