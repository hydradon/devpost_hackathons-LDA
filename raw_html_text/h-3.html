                    Me and my team came up with the idea, that will help you get your food quicker.  Hungry Hungry Hippos!  Or h^3 for short.  The goal was to make your restaurant experience faster and quicker.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    The goal was to make the app able to scan a NFC or a QR code to pull up a restaurant menu.  You could order from the app and call for a waiter from the app.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    I was in charge of fo the interface, so I used android studio (a new program to me) to build the face of the app.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Sadly, the time restraints made it hard.  It made it to where we weren't able to implement APIS and get the app to where we wanted to.  Our team decided to call it quicks, but I wanted to keep working on the interface so thats what I did.  It was interesting to see how Android Studio worked.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    I kept working.  It wasn't an easy thing to do, especially after I had made it home to my bed.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Android studio is cool but not as cool when the only thing keeping you up is an energy drink.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for H^3
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully, I can figure out how to make APIs work and have something that can actually work and not look like it works.
