                    The inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web app was inspired by years of sitting in class, making jokes and comments about the lesson to my neighbors. It also stems from the increasingly impersonal nature of modern social media, and the idea that most people can only keep track of a limited number of things at a time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The site displays a grid of nine squares. The one at center is you: you can write what you have to say and send it off. The other eight squares are your neighbors: they post as well, they can see what you write, and you can see what they write. this creates a personal, small-group interaction environment, instead of the traditional expansive impersonal one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app was built with the flask framework, and all python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and  database resources were written from scratch. The project is currently hosted on Google App Engine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone on the team was fairly new to web development, so a lot of the work, including the database setup, custom CSS, and JavaScript were challenging. Launching the working app on Google App Engine was also challenging, as the first half of development had happened on disparate development servers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because we had so little web experience, We're very proud of the fact that we now have a stable version of our project out on the web.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone on the team gained experience with at least one component of web development, so this project has been an excellent learning experience.
