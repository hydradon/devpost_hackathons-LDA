                    If you&rsquo;re a citizen of Pakistan, then there is a strong possibility that you will find yourself in a damaged street, surrounded by ditches, opened drains, bearing heavy machineries that were working on street and authorities never came back to check on it, uncovered manholes, broken streetlamps and things like that. Citizens normally ignore these things because they don&rsquo;t even know how to go about it. After doing a small survey, Team Murammat finds out that people don&rsquo;t even know the system, who to approach, how to approach and how to get it fixed. So they leave it on authorities. In the survey, respondents suggested that maybe they could do something with their smartphones in this modern era to tell these authorities about it. So we took this inspiration and have built a full-fledge mobile app for it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through Murammat, end user takes a picture and asks the user to upload it by enabling their current location. Murammat gets the location and pins it on the map with a detailed description about your report.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Murammat allows users to list nearby reports by giving their location access to the app. The user can verify the problem by upvoting it. The more votes a report gets, the more priority it gets and it starts trending within that area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most important part of this app is, when votes about a report reach to a certain number, the app automatically sends a text message to the relevant authorities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Murammat is built on Android technology. Right now we targeted Android only because there are more way more Android users in Pakistan than any other technology. Team Murammat is award winning UX/UI designing, so we believed in simplicity and user-friendliness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When a user opens the Murammat app, user needs to sign in using social media account like Facebook. We are relying on Facebook because, in Pakistan majority of people use Facebook. a simple yet beautiful camera screen. To submit a report along with the picture, description needs to be added. If the user is intending to just view the reports reported by others, the screen can be skipped to next screen that shows top nearby reports and recent nearby reports. The app uses users&rsquo; Location, Camera, Gallery and a social media account.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The challenges that we faced during this app were:
1-  An appealing interface and navigation between the screens
2-  We had to use an interface that people are already familiar with just like snapchat 
3-  Some users did not want to use their identity so we had to provide an alternate solution i.e. complete anonymity 
4-  We had to make the process within 3 taps
5-  We had to integrate SMS API to keep informing users about the reports they submitted. We did not want to prompt to user on every change that was made to their report. So the app only sends important notifications like if the votes on that report reach to 20.
6-  We had to send an SMS if possible to the authorities responsible for that area or an email to the authorities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we have developed and designed this app in less than 2 days. We are proud to have the design that Murammat has.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next step for Murammat is to create the same app for other platforms like iOS. Our app for iOS is almost ready. We are building more ways to give users more control over the app.
