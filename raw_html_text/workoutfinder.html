                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a simple app with a clean interface that quickly generates a custom workout that is tailored to your needs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    by requiring a few simple inputs, it generates workouts that meet criteria for losing weight, gaining weight, or maintaining current weight and living an overall healthy and well balanced lifestyle.

                <p>
                    android may look fun and easy, but there are a lot of bugs that drag it down
