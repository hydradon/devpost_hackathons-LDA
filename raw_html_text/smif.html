                </h2>
                <p>
                    The problems that we encountered in daily life and want to create something to overcome those problems and make the life (at least a little) smoother for us and for everyone.

                    SMIF (Smart Meals Intelligent Fridge) aims to make your food management a breeze by keeping track of what you eat in an unobtrusive and intuitive way
It remembers what you put in your fridge and is, therefore, capable of suggesting recipes, reminding you when you're running low on items, when something is about to go bad, and also help you have a healthy and balanced diet. It uses IOT devices and Machine Learning to achieve these things.

                        We have a very highly accurate image recognition software (without the help of any API) that can detect all the groceries (that we have trained).

                        Our Pi can detect the motion and intuitively know when you put the item into the fridge so, it won't be recording all the things in behind, it will take a picture and send it to the server

                            only when

                        you put something into the fridge.
