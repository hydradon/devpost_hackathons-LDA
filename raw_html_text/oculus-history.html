                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Taking involvement in history to a new level by allowing kids to explore and investigate historical sites in real time- in an even more immersive environment.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Esri CityEngine as well as their ArcGIS mapping capabilities, we were able to access detailed 3D maps and information on the city of Venice for example. Then, using annotations and other technology in the Unity engine we were able to highlight famous buildings in the Venice cityscape, as well as give an idea of how different a city can be structured.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The original idea was to utilize an Oculus Rift, however none of our hardware on hand was compatible, and additionally all of the compatible laptops provided had already been rented out. We had to change our technology to utilize Google Cardboard Android technology, which relied on the processor in the phone. It allowed us to load our virtual reality simulations from our own laptops, but it had fewer capabilities and a much slower frame rate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Porting the Esri world textures and cityscapes into a usable format, which could then be created into a mini landscape environment that virtual reality could explore.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to work with the APIs and technology of Esri CityEngine, as well as incorporating Oculus technology into a 3D rendered environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for VR History
                </h2>
                <p>
                    VR History has a lot of potential to grow as a product by adding more content. Developing more cities and sites to explore, as well as making it more procedurally generated would expand on the project.
