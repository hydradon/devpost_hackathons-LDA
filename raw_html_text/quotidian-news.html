                    Problem
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Newsletter Content Industry has been growing quite rapidly over the past 2-3 years, mostly in part with super successful daily newsletters like Morning Brew [1 million subs,  $3 million in revenue] and platforms such as substack that let any individual set up a newsletter subscription business [ 25k paying subscribers, ~125k in MRR ].
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, email in developing countries such as India, .... is growing at a much slower pace than other tech adoption in India (WhatsApp, Facebook, etc...).
                </p>
                <p>
                    And as India moves to a futuristic content platforms and monetization methods [the-ken has X,000 monthly subscribers], current email platforms will not be able to take advantage of a huge population that doesn't have email
                </p>
