                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I talked with my friends back in Bangladesh and they were struggling with the SAT vocab words as some of the English meaning of them were not also understandable for them, so I though of coming up with SAT vocab words translation to help people of other languages
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a platform where SAT vocab words are translated into the language you choose. For this prototype, there are only two languages here currently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used html, css, javascript and jquery
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to use SQL, and integrate that into HTML, but then I felt since it's just a prototype, I'll go for basic table in HTML directly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well, I feel that if I can successfully expand this app into more languages and more vocab words, it will be helpful to a lot of people for all over the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although I havent used it here, I learnt SQL a lot since I was initially planning to use it.
                </p>
