                <p>
                    Provides an easy database of medical history that both students and teachers can access.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the overall website using HTML. For frontend design, we used CSS. To store information on the local storage, we used JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All four of us had no previous experience with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript before today. Learning how the syntax of these languages worked and how to troubleshoot were big challenges. We also had to find a way to store information. We decided to use local storage due to our lack of time and experience. We also wanted to have the user's schedule, however since we did not have access to other student's timetables, we simply used a dummy one.

                <p>
                    Users are able to submit their medical history, view related links, log out, and then log back in to view their medical history again.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                </p>

                    What's next for Med-Ow
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to be able to have student's timetables available and to find a more long-term storage option for the students and teachers to access at all time.
