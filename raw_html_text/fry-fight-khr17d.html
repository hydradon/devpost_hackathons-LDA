                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In elementary school, my friends and I loved french fries so much, we made a character out of it. It was a french fry from France who has a moustache and a beret. We made so many variations of the character ranging from a violinist french fry to an iron man fry. In the back of my mind, I always knew that this childhood idea would be perfect to pursue as a game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fry Fight is an infinite runner where a french fry is fighting for its survival by running away from being eaten by the hungry human. It must dodge flying utensils, avoid the harmful condiments and maintain its distance to not be snatched by the human hand. Oil drops must be collected to sustain its crispness while grains of salt must be obtained to add to your salt bank. Players can use power-ups to their advantage in trying to achieve a high score. At certain points of the game, the French Fry will face a boss and attempt to defeat it in order to advance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this through XCode using Swift's SpriteKit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had plenty of trouble generating and randomizing the different sets of objects. Experimenting with the timings of when each object must be generated was also cumbersome. Implementing the pause button and function was challenging because I had to deactivate specific things.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is my first mobile game I have developed and shipped to the app store! It took the whole summer to develop but was truly worth it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned the basics of game development and design. In terms of coding, I was exposed to a new programming language: Swift!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Fry Fight
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I plan on adding more boss stages to my game to spice up the gameplay. I also plan to refine the runner aspect of the game more through adding additional sets of objects and obstacles and introducing new powerups. Finally, I hope to have a shop where players can purchase different kinds of fries to play as.
