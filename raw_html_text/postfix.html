                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of times when my group mates and I purchased products for any reason, we ended up just giving up because the whole return process was too much of a hassle.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As soon as you log in to the app. Select the item you want to return from your order history then fill in the form to give context about why you are returning the item. Once form is submitted a driver is requested to pickup and estimated time till arrival is displayed
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we built both a web app using JavaScript and a mobile app on android with android studio. our server is run with ngrok and express. And for getting location working we used the following APIs: google geolocation API(to get current location), google distance matrix API(to calculate distance from driver), google maps API(to display google map), geocode API(to convert coordinates)
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    it was hard developing on two separate platforms. Android studio was also hard to work with
