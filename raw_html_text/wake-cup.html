                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realized that waking up to the same alarm tone of "ERRR ERRR ERRR" was starting to get old and it was time for a change. Also, most people when they wake up the first thing they do is 1) Check their phone or even just browse on it or 2) Drink a cup of coffee to get them up and going). We wanted to make it possible for people to "Wake Cup" with a sense of enjoyment and fun and this could be done by receiving snap videos and other incoming media from your friends as an alarm. Also, we all tend to forget the things we need to do because we are all busy, so we developed a way to get social interactive reminders to stay on task.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        Wake Cup!
                    </em>
                    allows it's users to essentially set alarms / task for themselves. Once this is done, they are now open to receive "Wake Cups" from any of their friends who are willing to send. These "Wake Cups" have no boundaries and the user sending the "Wake Cups" can have as much fun with it as they want. Now, you can wake up with instant entertainment and people will be a little more willing to waking up. However,
                    <em>
                        Wake Cup!
                    </em>
                    is not just limited to user's receiving only "Good Morning" snaps, but also snaps to remind them on whatever daily task they put as the description when they set their alarm.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built
                    <em>
                        Wake Cup!
                    </em>
                    as an iOS app using Swift.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many obstacles, but the one that stunted us the most was not knowing how to implement sending video snaps. Also, we had to figure out how to implement an alarm clock for the app, but we eventually got it figured out.
Couldn't get the free domain to work, but oh well.

                    We all did a good job and in the long run we did the best we could to develop
