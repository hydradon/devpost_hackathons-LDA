                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Farmworkers are easily abused and their wages can be stolen very easily. Farm operators have an interest in protecting farmworkers' rights because consumers are increasingly conscious of responsibly sourced products
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application allows farmworkers to enter a record of the crops they pick onto the blockchain so that anyone can investigate to make sure that they were properly treated. They can flag disputes if they disagree with how the payment is processed. Eventually, it could be integrated with dispute resolution, automatic payment, and automatic certification systems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the front end with react, used solidity, truffle, and web3 to integrate front and back end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Storing all the relevant data about the crops (called "pieces") and the farmworkers wages would be so expensive, we had to adjust how we stored this information and transmitted it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the data stored, building a front end, and working together to solve very difficult problems in spite of limited resources.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Storing and transmitting data on blockchain is very expensive, and that solidity requires unique problem solving to meet the needs of the working world.
