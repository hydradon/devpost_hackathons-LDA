                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A child's mind is like a sponge, readily absorbing everything around it. Building upon this adage, we feel that there is a need for healthcare education through interactive means which will capture the imagination of young minds. And what better way to make it come true than to integrate toys and technology!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our product uses a doll, named Penny, as the interactive interface. Penny randomly develops different types of diseases namely heart attack, fever and minor injuries. The inflicted area glows red in a particular pattern to indicate the disease  and the child will have to determine a course of treatment for Penny.The treatment information is also shown on a mobile app. Based on the treatment, Penny will either get better and the diseased area will stop glowing or she will remain sick with the diseased staying as it is.The treatments are simple and designed in a way that children will enjoy administering them:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Fever is treated by applying wet cloths to Penny's forehead.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Heart attack is treated by administering CPR
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Injuries are treated by applying bandages properly
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used arduino and multiple sensors connected to the doll to show and react to symptoms. The arduino uses the wifi module to talk to a server which updates the state of the treatment being performed. The treatment data is shown on a mobile app that is built using react-native.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team is composed of 3 students, attending their first hackathon, matched with a mentor to guide them. Since it was also the team's first time using arduino with limited programming experience, this hack took a lot of effort and understanding of the fundamentals of circuits, hardware and arduino programming.
