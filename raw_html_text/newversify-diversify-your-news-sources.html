                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People tend to consume news which they find edifying and often this leads to entrenched viewpoints. News organizations, however credible are not immune to their own deficiencies in scope. We were inspired by the way ScreenTime for iOS helps you change your habits just by giving you information.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Chrome extension lets you know when you have been spending time reading news sites which are determined by Media Bias Fact Check to tilt in a significant direction politically. It then provides news articles on topics you have read about which counteract your information diet by being central or slightly on the other side of the political spectrum.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a custom chrome extension with a custom API which uses data from Media Bias Fact Check to analyze your reading history. We then used the Event Registry APIs to provide alternative articles to read.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hadn't coded in JavaScript much before, let alone built a Chrome Extension, so it was an arduous task, but we all learned a lot.
