                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In all honesty, we came into this hackathon ready to learn and work on something that we were interested in and after talking, that topic was memes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website contains creative meme characters as well as a makeshift game against the troll meme.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using sublime, atom...and a lot of stack overflow.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    We did not know javascript, at all.

                    The parallax scrolling and learning something new!
