                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Today, everyone's looking down instead of looking up.  Everyone has a smart phone, making it hard to disconnect and focus on the real word.  We will help you and your family focus back on your real life!

                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Imagine a big red button at your dinner table.  Pressing the button forces everyone around the table off line, so that everyone is mentally present.  In addition to this, our device posts a note to your Facebook telling your friends that you are off line.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first, we wanted to make a jammer.  That's illegal and impracticable given the available hardware.
Instead, we are disconnecting every device from the wifi network upon the button being pressed.
We tried using several different microcontrollers, such as Arduino, Edison, and finally Raspberry Pi.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of learning how to use microcontrollers and having them interface with the server.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes, you have to completely flip over your implementation rethink everything. Having a great idea does not mean you are above the law.

                    Only posting to facebook users that currently use the wifi that we want to disconnect.
