                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having to walk around SF can be a bit daunting. One minute you're in a great neighborhood, and the next you're walking down a dangerous street. We wanted to build something that priorities safety over shortcuts or time of arrival.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finds the safest route for you to walk from Point A to B. Also allows you to ping other strollers around you when you feel nervous while walking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the MapQuest APIs to calculate routes, search and geocode addresses. We used SF crime data to calculate the safest route.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to generate a heatmap on mobile using the crime data but could not finish.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd like to incorporate crime data across multiple cities, and eventually open it up to communities to help build a real-time graph.
