                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of us got the idea for this game from a 1D RPG crawler that she played in an arcade over her summer internship.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You play as the blue pixel and try to fight your way past the enemies to reach the end goal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we found some LED strips and a compatible Arduino library, and figured out how to program the strip. 
Then, using an existing library for help, we obtained input from the Wii controllers.
Using this input/output, we then built up the game logic, resulting in the final product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wrangling the Wii library and debugging the game logic took us much longer than expected. There were many bugs in both, but because we did not build the Wii library, it took a while to figure out how to fix the issues. The I/O system also wasn't finalized until after we finished writing the game logic, so we were basically writing a game without being able to test it!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We finished it! We took our project from a concept to a real, playable game - that's pretty awesome!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to structure our project such that the Arduino, Wiimote, and C++ code all talked to each other. We plan to use these connections for projects in the future - we really like LEDs!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pixel Hero
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have two hundred-foot long LED strips that run all the way down our hall and we plan to try to play the game on there! We want to try to make a two-player version where people race to the end.
