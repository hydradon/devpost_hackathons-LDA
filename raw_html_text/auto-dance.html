                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a ballet instructor and sometimes I think my choreography is too formulaic.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program writes a dance for you to suit music of your choosing.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I focused on dividing user provided music data into sections and analyzing their speed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The python clock function uses really large units of time.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I finished.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android Studio is a good learning experience, but not the best choice for a timed competition.
                </p>

                    What's next for auto-dance
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I might use it to choreograph some warm ups for my class so we can make fun of them.
