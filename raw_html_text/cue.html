                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We noticed a trend in our actions that we could not fix: we would have long term goals where at any one point working on them was optional, and they never got done. We were talking about behavioral psychology at the kickoff on Friday night and this wonderful idea hit us: use technology to aid us in being more productive!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a web-app (and soon to be chrome app) which allows you to choose tasks which are important to
                    <em>
                        you
                    </em>
                    . You can put in tasks you want to be completed and times that you can generally work on them, then it will remind you to go do that, and you will see your progress in these goals. One such is reading for school: You put in "Read textbook for 30 minutes" as the name, and when you start reading you start the timer. Once the timer is full, your progress bar for the day is full! This gamification of doing these tasks is so helpful for getting it done.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally designed it thoroughly as a concept, and worked from there, first making a photoshop mockup and a javascript client. Then we continued to add new features and perfect old ones. Our workflow was extremely well organized, and we got so much done for only being a team of two.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were many challenges that we ran into, but we employed our google skills to the fullest and were able for every problem to find a solution or a simpler alternative. One such problem was the tradeoffs between building it first as a chrome app or as a web app.  On the one hand, chrome apps have storage system which is much simpler, but web apps have very hassle-free integration with Button. We love the way button integrates into apps so simply, and it fits so well with our project there was no way we could refuse those returns.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am very proud of the amount of work we've been able to do in the time we've had. Our project is far from perfect, but it is so great for how much we could have done. We communicated very well through the whole competition, and were very understanding when we needed to sleep. This is the longest hackathon either of us have ever done, and I, Max, am so glad that we had this time to work. We are both self-taught and because we are in high-school and don't have access to lots of courses, it is difficult to find common ground on approaches to organization, but we talked through all the edits and came to the best consensus every time.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to organize a one-page web application, which was very new to both of us.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Cue
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd love to make this interpersonal, so that the users can make their goals public and see their friends' goals. This would intensify the incentive to get these things which need to be done done, which is the point of the app.
