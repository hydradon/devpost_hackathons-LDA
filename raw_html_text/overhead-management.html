                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As current employees of the Home Depot, we have witnessed first hand the difficulties of overhead management. Overhead management is keeping track of specific inventory that is placed on a pallet on a bay to bay basis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This android application will keep track of every location in a Home Depot that could host a pallet of merchandise. The system will then assign a status of availability depending on a location's current data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created an android app that will keep track of the data through a simple interface synced to a Firebase database. By syncing data to a database, every user will have up-to-date information about the status of potential spots for pallets. Every user will have the ability to update the information of any location in the system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to having little design experience, we had trouble implementing modern design patterns such as android material design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to create a system that will help our fellow coworkers save time and hard ache. Also, coming together to work as a team was a fun process in creating the android application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The complexity of storing warehouse information and accessing its data. Also, we learned the importance of working together and communication across the team in order to construct a final idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Overhead Management
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tagging every location with a barcode and implementing a scan and go system. Also, adding more error handling and better over design. Lastly, adding a visual representation of the current data in a map form.
