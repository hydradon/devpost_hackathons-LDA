                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to learn about APIs and see if we could implement them in real world projects that can help people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a chat based application just like whatsapp but instead of an image in the background is uses the back camera. In this way, the user can see what is in front of him. This allows a safe use of texting while walking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an API to send messages in real time but it doesn't save the messages in a server. The messages are saved in the memory of the device. In addition, we had to access the camera and create different layers of views in order to be able to have the camera running in the background whilst simultaneously sending messages to another user in the same chat room.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to implement the API was quite hard at first especially when parsing the information from the JSON files in order to send messages and also receive them. Accessing the camera and making it compatible with the views was also a struggle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learnt a lot in these 24 hours especially APIs as we have never really worked with them from scratch. Other than that, we have had to learn all this without any supervised help which was exciting and intriguing. We are proud to have a working project that reached our expectations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about how to work with our team and allocating the tasks. Since we have done the application in Swift, most of us have had to learn how to use it from scratch.
