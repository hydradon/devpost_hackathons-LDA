                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I watch a show on the internet in which two teams compete against each other to come up with search terms that will out preform the other. I thought this would be a fun idea to bring to a party/gathering event.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trend Master allows you to look up a single term, or compare two terms, to find their ranking on google search results. It can be used to answer a simple question, solve an argument, or play a game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This skill was built with NodeJS running on a Lambda instance. I started with a skill layout and integrated the google trends system first. Once that was complete I started adding the multimodal elements.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the multimodal elements to work correctly. There was a limitation of what is possible with APL and that put a block on some of my original ideas. I decided to go with a simple clean design, rather than focus on big and fancy graphics.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Actually submitting for once. I have registered for pretty much every Alexa based hackathon since they started and just either haven't had time or inspiration to complete one. This was over my winter break from college so I made sure to dedicate the time to finally get one finished.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to work with and build for Lambda and Alexa. I had a little bit of experience from a hackathon I did for Capital One in Boston a few years ago, but never went on to learn anything new with it. Since then screens and new ways to interface with the Alexa have been added and it was a great experience learning how to design and program for them.
                </p>

                    What's next for Trend Master
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hope to add a few new features after the competition. Possibly a scoring mode, and geography information displayed on screen.
