                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to have a home heating and air conditioning system which both ensured that less energy was consumed in maintaining a comfortable temperature at home and removing the need to constantly have individuals change the thermostat themselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The device is intended to read the surrounding temperature and change the room temperature based on those readings. The program runs on a raspberry pi to conserve power and maintain an environment that conserves as much energy as possible. It would allow the user to schedule how he/she would want a home maintained in advance and at different times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python as well as the google calendar to receive and send instructions to a thermostat. The program runs on the raspian Linux environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trouble with the wiringpi library and rest requests to the google calendar api not working. Being unfamiliar with the various Linux environments and hardware required.
