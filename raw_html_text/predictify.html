                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    N/A - The hackathon's theme didn't sufficiently match with my personal interests so this was kind of just force-pumped out
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's got a nice UI I guess. There's a lot more that's missing but oh well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I should sleep more during these things.

                </h2>

                    Finish it off - once I have more sleep and perhaps submit it on the app store
                </p>
