                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rich Young of General Dynamics

                </h2>
                <p>
                    A breakout clone that uses Myo API to control the paddle.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it in Java using stdlib and a 3rd party API wrapper for Myo connect
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally we tried to make a game in Unity using a C# api wrapper, but ran into issues with Visual Studios and the wrapper itself.
We then switched our focus to a simpler game in a language we were more familiar with.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Collision recognition and using the yaw of your arm to control the paddle
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use languages that software is initially developed for.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Nothing, we don't own a Myo.
