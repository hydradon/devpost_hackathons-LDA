                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maintenance Engineers work on their feet for hours to get their equipment operational by the end of the day. 
They are rarely in the mood to input meticulous details of their operations into an unintuitive and slow computer interface at the end of their shifts. This leads to inaccurate recorded data and little understanding of what common problems actually are.

                    "Databus Insights Platform"TM  is a  secure cloud based AI Enabled  platform that will be  built to address end-end data infrastructure challenges from integration and cleansing of data to deriving and predicting insights. The cloud based data discovery and insights platform enables businesses connect, transform and model data coming from multiple sources to generate prescriptive and predictive insights. The platform&rsquo;s intuitive workbench will be capable to connect data from multiple sources (Sound, image, video )&amp; generate a 360-degree view of the problem you are looking at and generate prescriptive/predictive  analytics.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Three days of guidance from 30 plus DoD mentors and AWS experts helped us form a solid proposal and project pitch for the judging process.

                <p>
                    Creating the practical/ immediate implementation capable advanced tech. Had multiple iteration with different end users to give the best possible solution. Condensing our pitch and making it in the 4 minute limit.
