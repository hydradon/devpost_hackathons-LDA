                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Helping reduce waste and preventing people from buying things that they will only use once or every once in a while.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a neighborhood-based app where users post things that they are willing to let people borrow, and where they can view current listings in their neighborhood for things that they want to borrow.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Xcode to design the interface with Swift, as well as the backend with Swift. We created local databases in our project directory.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Trying to understand Swift, and using swift in Xcode

                </p>

                <p>
                    Finish converting the storyboard into code as well as implementing geofencing to only show users in your "neighborhood" area.
