                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Often times when visiting restaurants it is tough to know the nutritional information for the offered meals. If dietary restrictions are not a problem it might just be hard deciding where you want to eat. Chews is an alexa skill that helps you decide where or what to eat using your dietary restrictions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using voice interaction with alexa, the user can set dietary restrictions and are offered food or restaurant possibilities. The purpose is to help the user find meals and restaurants based off of their dietary restrictions, or randomly choose meals or restaurants for people who just cant decide where to eat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the back-end in Python using the AWS (amazon web services) lambda environment. the interaction model is built from an alexa specific json file.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially were going to build a mobile app but after 18 hours of trying to teach ourselves to code in C# and use Xamarin with minimal progress we decided to try another route with the alexa skill kit.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that after all the failed compiles, long nights, and failing at the mobile app design we did not give up and managed to build something despite changing paths over half way through.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can't learn a programming language and framework in 2 days! We also learned quite a bit of the alexa environment and developing on the amazon platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Chews
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on trying again on the app development for chews to give more platform an usability options.
We would also like to heavily expand upon our platform to include a much larger array of functionality on the alexa.
