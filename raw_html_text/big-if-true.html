                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I thought it would be really cool to build a large monitor out of phones.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right now, it allows users to join a room, and simultaneously start playing a gif on the phones.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Swift to create the iOS app, Python/Flask to build the web server, and Socket.io to enable communication between them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I struggled quite a bit at first with things not appearing on the screen, which almost made me switch to React Native until I realized my phone couldn't connect to WiFi. Later on, it was difficult to crop the gif.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that there is decent synchronicity, and that the gifs kind of look nice together.
                </p>

                    I learned Swift and Socket.io.
