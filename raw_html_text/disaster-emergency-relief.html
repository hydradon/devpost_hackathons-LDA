                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Natural disasters are an inevitable part of life but people receiving disaster aid doesn&rsquo;t have to be. Some disaster relief organizations and plans require credentials before aid is sent, but there are plenty of nonprofits and volunteer supplied organizations that do not. As soon as an event happens they begin to gather supplies and volunteer personnel and move out. But what if they didn&rsquo;t have to wait until after the event has happened to start gathering volunteers. What if they know as soon as disaster data is collected for storm surges, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes,etc. that there would need to be personnel on-site as soon as the event is over.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project is a WPF application that interacts with an R script and a UiPath file. The UiPath file web scrapes a website so that we were able to get the information about the previous natural disasters. The UiPath scraped over 61,000 data entries and imported it into a CSV. The WPF application takes the information from the CSV and adds it to the Firebase Realtime database. It also allowed users to create a Disaster Relief Form and submit it to the database. The R script went through the data using Machine Learning to find out if the the created forms will receive FEMA aid based on the criteria from past disaster information taken from the website.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Firebase to build the database, UiPath to import the open source dataset to the database and to build a webscraper to pull data from natural disaster sites, R to code the machine learning algorithm and C++ to take data from the database and modify it for useful information.
