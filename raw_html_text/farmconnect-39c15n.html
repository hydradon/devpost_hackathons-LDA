                    Executive Summary:
Address farm workers health by keeping track of the network of farmers currently on the field. We will use Rasberry Pi 3 in our service station that allows two-way communication between farmers and the station. Rasberry Pi will connect to the internet to communicate with web API&rsquo;s that track real-time weather data. This weather data will synchronize with our web application to provide decide whether it is a safe day to work on the field.
Design:
Projected challenges 
When one of the farmer workers gets out of range, there is the possibility that connectivity with raspberry pi 3 (our server) gets lost. As a result, there will be a lost in communication. One way to prevent this will be to improve signal range amplifiers. 
There might be other non-farmworkers interfering with the network. 
Assumption that all farmers HAVE phones
Accuracy of measuring humidity and severe weather warnings
Loss of signal between either hardware or wifi networks due to animal interference or severe weather - solutions include redundancy of methods for communication between Health center and crew members.
Application
Web developmentDeveloped via Javascript and HTML
UI - HTML,CSS,JAVSCRIPT,PHP - Showing Weather at different farm locations for certain health stations to regulate working hours
Online web app connects to weather API to collect real time data for weather at different locations
Web app will also keep track of the status of all raspberry pis in the system to make sure
