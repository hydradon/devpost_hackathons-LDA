                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We noticed that poor mental health within university is a problem that is becoming increasingly relevant. We wanted to create something to help university students balance uni life with good mental health.
There is a long process to get support from trained professionals (up to 4 months) and this is just for the consultation appointment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As many GPs recommend noting down peaks or lows in emotion in a journal (writing down location, time, who you are with and what music you were listening to) to self-track trends, we decided to simplify this process. Our app allows the user to make an entry and display these emotional trends using visual tools to improve self-understanding.
We also store a set of contacts that the user can use in an emergency.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to make this solution, we wanted a set of tools that operate across a range of devices and we found that JavaScript has near universal support. We used JavaScript, React JS, Gatsby and Twilio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Steep learning curve, time pressure, first time we have worked together in a team
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of how much we have learnt in these past 24 hours; we now feel much more confident in web development. 
We are pleased that we were able to use Twilio products in a relevant way within our app.
Our goal was to produce something that would be of use to the people around us and we feel that we have achieved this.
                </p>

                    What's next for MindMatters

                <p>
                    We believe that there is a lot of room for scale with our app.
There are certain features that we designed with a mind to implement these in the future such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        a Maps page to display nearby hospitals/ counsellors, or saved locations
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        text alerts using Twilio before a certain low or high point in your day to remind you to include self-care in your routine
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        user accounts so that our platform is accessible from different devices
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        using Spotify to map certain feelings to songs that the user listens to, possibly to recommend similar
                    </li>
