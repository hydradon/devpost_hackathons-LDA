                    Our goal was to provide a personalised assistant that could match you with the shows of your taste, meanwhile, inbuilt scheduler would help you get the most out of your Fringe experience with however little time you've got.

                    Demo system was developed working with the data-set provided by Craneware for the Fringe Festival 2019. Here, users are given a random set events and based on the picture and a short description of the event have to decide whether they are interested in attending the event or not. Every such input determines the shows to be recommended in the future. Show descriptions were intended to be used to identify and compare the nature of different events.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unimplemented scheduler was going to take into account users availability and find the best plan to experience Fringe to the fullest. The web app would also serve as a place to buy tickets and plan your route to the venue!
