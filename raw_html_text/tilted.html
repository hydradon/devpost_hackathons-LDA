                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being "tilted" is a (formerly) nonspecific adjective attributed to League of Legends players that have a 
"lose-more" attitude; you lose once, you get upset, you're more likely to lose again. We wanted to know how accurate this notion really is, and whether it can be measured for the average player.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Calculates the relative "tilt" of a user over the span of a specified number of matches. This data is represented as a graph, as well as an overall "current tilt."
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Front-end was build with MD bootstrap framework, with standard HTML/JS/CSS and a proxy server set up with Node.js and AWS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Riot's API was difficult to work with, and we ended up having to create a proxy server with AWS that would allow us to communicate with the API. Additionally, there was the difficulty of coming up with an objective measure of what was likely to effect someone's mood in-game.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting by our CORS error and creating our tilt-calculating algorithms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to set up a proxy server to communicate with an API, as well as performing JSON requests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tilted
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Increased amount of data visualization using chartlist.js and make this available to the general majority of League of Legends players. We would also like to fine-tune the algorithm.
