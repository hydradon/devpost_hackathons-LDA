                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It connects volunteers and hospital patients who match up together based on their personalties and interests. We created a website for users such as volunteers and hospital patients to provide a description of who they are and topics they have interest in. Our back-end programming will match volunteers and hospital patients based on their compatibility, and the volunteers will be able to choose which patients that they want to volunteer with.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our front-end is a website that was built using HTML/CSS/Javascript and Bootstrap. The information that users submit is passed down to Amazon's DynamoDB, where the information is stored and then pulled out by our Java program. Our Java program is implementing IBM Watson's API to classify users into 3 of 16 personalities. Our Java program looks at the users personalities and all of the topics/interests that the users entered and compares them with the other type of user(volunteer to patient and vice versa).
