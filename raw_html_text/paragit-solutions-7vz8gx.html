                <p>
                    The project consists of two solutions, a hardware diagnostic device and an assisting software. The solution will be able to more precisely assess Parkinson&rsquo;s disease cardinal symptoms with respect to UPDRS scale which is further described in the attached PP-presentation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PoC was made with a simple breadboard and conductive textile, afterwards we moved further and developed rev.1.0 PCB.

                    We learned how to involve different aspects of business go-to-market strategies as well as team-building.
