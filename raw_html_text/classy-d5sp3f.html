                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the demo given to us of Google's ML Vision API in which a face was analyzed to determine emotion. Since as a team we were already focused on education, we decided to adapt this tool to the classroom.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web app takes continuous image data of students in class to analyze in Google's ML Vision. The algorithms send back data such as happiness and attentiveness. In addition, a text transcription of the lecture is taken in real time with relevant topics highlighted using Google's Speech API and Text Analytics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web app makes use of NodeJS, React, MongoDB, and Google Speech and Vision APIs
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adapting available documentation to our personal use cases.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first full-stack application that we were able to create from the ground up with a database, server, and front-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to properly make use of MongoDB as well as Google's powerful APIs utilizing machine learning.
