                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game of GO.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The objective of the game is for users to gather as many particles to their scoring regions by using magnets to attract into these regions. These particles and magnets obey the laws of physics such as Coloumb's Law.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used libgdx in Android Studio.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to fulfill all the requirements for our minimum viable product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to use libgdx. Android game development is hard.
                </p>
