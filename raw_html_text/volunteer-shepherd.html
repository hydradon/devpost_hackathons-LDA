                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the most valuable resources that a Non Profit Organization has would be their volunteers. We wanted to create an application that NPOs could use that would allow a seamless way to communicate with their volunteers, as well as a way to more accurately track attendance for volunteer events using an individual's volunteer history.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Volunteer Shepherd has a user view that allows individuals to volunteer for upcoming events. An admin view shows detailed information for events that indicates the projected number of volunteers that will be in attendance for the event. Confirmation texts are automatically sent out 7 and 3 days prior to the event prompting the volunteer to confirm if they would be attending still, and updating the DB accordingly. If 2 days prior to the event, the desired number of volunteers hasn't been met, a solicitation will be sent out to prior volunteers to sign up for the event if available.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Volunteer Shepherd was built using React/Redux for Client Side rendering. Spring Boot was used for our back end with PostgreSQL to store our data.
