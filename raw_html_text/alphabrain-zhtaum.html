                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mental health issues have never been more prevelant - an estimated one in ten people are affected by them. To help those very people, we developed the idea of an app that you can talk to about your state of mind and use the collected data to both anticipate and help treat any problems that might arise.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app prompts the user for input about their current state of mind in regular intervals. This input might be in form of speech, text, or a simple value that can be set via a slider - the higher the value, the happier you're feeling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All the data collected over time is condensed into simple statistics. These statistics can then be used not only to help the user with problems they are currently facing - by recommending near-by therapists, for example - but also to predict future problems based on known data patterns. Suspected problems can be verified via more targeted questions about the user's wellbeing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have a huge focus on our user's privacy. All the collected data will be encrypted at all times. Even on the user's device, the app will only be accessible via a passcode or, if available, a fingerprint reader like TouchID. These procautions are taken to make our users feel safe enough to share their
                    <em>
                        real
                    </em>
                    feelings with the app.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started from a very simple prototype and iteratively added actual features. Most of the work was focusing on learning new technologies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Alphabrain
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a set of growing features that we would love to see implemented. The most important one is to have a working learning algorithm that learns both from our own data and research. Other than that the possibilities are endless: Geolocalized help, pairing with a telemedicine platform to establish very fast contact with the doctor of your choice, partnering with health professionals to help diagnostics. Expanding the capabilities from mental health issues to general health issues to track and fight long term problems like obesity, diabetes or cancer is also something we would like to look into.
