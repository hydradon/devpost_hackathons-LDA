                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pangolins are adorable, and they are also critically-endangered, so I was inspired to make a pangolin-themed environmentalism game for the social good prompt.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a website that has a basic minigame (where a pangolin dodges bullets with arrow keys) and some background information about pangolins.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had to self-learn a lot of JavaScript for this, and my code is not completely error-free...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm glad that it somewhat works!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned (perhaps too much) JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Protect the Pangolin!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I need to fix errors and add a scoring system.
                </p>
