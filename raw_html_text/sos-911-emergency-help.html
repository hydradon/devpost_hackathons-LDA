                <p>
                    When I was a kid, I always watch the show call 911 and I'm amazed on how 911 can really help saves life. But to get help the person needs to be able to reach out to 911. I've been thinking what happen if that person is alone and not able to move around? How can he or she make the call?
                </p>
