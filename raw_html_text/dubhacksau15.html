                    [Pic Me] is an Android application that uses Clarifai's API for photo recognition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How it works:
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>1. Our application generates random adjectives for the users to match via their phone gallery or by taking a picture
2. Using Clarifai's API, we compare the current adjective to the list of tags in the photos
3. Users are given a percentage score based on how their adjective ranked on the list of tags, with number 1 being the highest
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Other Features:
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>1. Refresh Button so the users can switch their word up
2. Definition Button [WIP] in case users need to know what certain words mean
3. Login [WIP], to make the interface more friendly

                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>1. Yulong Tan --&gt; Created most of the Android UI and implemented activities / functions, including the camera request
2. Alan Tan --&gt; Wrote the Java code that generates random adjectives and the program that generates definitions from Dictionary.com
3. Allen Tran --&gt; Implemented the Clarifai API into our application and worked on the scaling of widgets, photos, and created access to the Android System's gallery 
4. Alex Poquiz --&gt; Worked mainly on the Firebase end [to implement logins] for the opening interface

                    Working with Clarifai
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>It was rather hard to implement at first, because our team had little experience working with APIs and other network based functions. Clarifai's short yet interesting presentation gave us a good idea of a simple app that we wanted to create and we had a lot of fun reading into their documentation, trying to figure out how it worked. Once we did that, it was a long and hard journey, but we thoroughly learned a lot from this experience.
