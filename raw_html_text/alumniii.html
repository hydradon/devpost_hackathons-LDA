                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The barrier that exists between students and resources on public high school campuses. (Academic, Mental, Health)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alumniii is a framework that enables public high schools to create custom-tailored web apps for their student body which connects them resources on and off campus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed a proof of concept of what the final product that a school would see would look like. Ideally, with a longer timeline, we would design a script which would connect an online G-form to a database which creates a web app for the institution to utilize under the Alumniii servers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With little coding experience, it was difficult to create the script necessary to automate the web app creation process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed an elegant, user-friendly interface which would enable students to seek out help, whether it be personal or academic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to utilize Adobe XD to create prototype UI/UX designs for different interfaces and how to export said assets for web development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Alumniii
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to develop the script that automates this process and truly makes resources accessible.
