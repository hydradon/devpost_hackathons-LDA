                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most consumers do not think of legal issues until the problem is right at their doorstep. We would like to help consumers be proactive about their legal health.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Consumers will be working through a treasure map, picking the "correct" answers would take you on a direct path to the end, but the "wrong" answers will take you on a side path to learn why your answer was wrong. A summary page be presented at the end of the treasure hunt to show the different lessons the person had to take.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted a creative game that would keep the consumer interested and engaged.

                    What's next for Legal Health Check Up
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like this to be expanded into more components to provide a more comprehensive legal health check up.
