                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for Swap20 came from the growing number of centralized exchanges requiring more and more personal information. Swap20 facilitates the exchange of ERC-20 compliant tokens without sacrificing your privacy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Swap20 is a decentralized exchange with a focus on simplicity and transparency. Users do not need to keep track of buy or sell orders to perform exchanges at a competitive price.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Utilizing the 0x protocol, we designed and a created a simple web application that allows users to choose which tokens they wish to exchange. Modern technologies such as React and Polaris were used to create a seamless user interface that takes to complexity of exchanging tokens using centralized exchanges.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many challenges along the way such as developing using the 0x protocol and deploying our product on the Ropsten TestNet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Successfully utilizing the 0x protocol to create an application that could be used everyday.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team learned a lot about 0x and the potential it has to change the landscape of token exchanges.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Swap 20
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Deploying Swap 20 on the Ethereum mainnet and surfacing the relay it's built on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Swap 20 is and will always remain an open source platform.
