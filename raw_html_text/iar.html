                <p>
                    Information that we are looking for may be difficult to come by. Imagine if we can use scan commonly used objects to get those information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scanning objects to get relatable information regarding the item.
It not only acts as a tool for getting information about an item, it also helps to educate people on what they are scanning about. i.e. Scanning tools for product guide, animal enclosure for species information.
