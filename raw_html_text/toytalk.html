                    <li>
                        We didn't have microSD to USB to flash the microSD card.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We didn't have display and keyboard and mouse to set up the Raspberry Pi.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We didn't have ethernet cable to VNC or SSH into the Raspberry Pi.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        OS didn't flash properly to SD card for a bit.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Not enough hardware supplies (shields).

                        Segmentation faults in C took a bit of time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Trying to SSH without knowing the actual port number needed took a bit of time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We ran into countless Gradle sync issues on the Android app development.
