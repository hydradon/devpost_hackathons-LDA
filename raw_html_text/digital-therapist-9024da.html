                    Motive
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We both attend a high school with the highest suicidal rate in the county. We decided to make a learning, growing, robotic therapist to help people who are struggling like students at our school.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What does it do?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It has a get help and give help section. The get help section is meant for clients. The clients will be able to talk to the digital therapist while it replys back to them. The give help is password protected. It is meant to be used only by professional volunteers as they are the ones who can analyze how the clients respond to the digital therapist and edit the response if needed in order to improve the program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used java. In our program we customized our own therapist tree node and made various of ArrayList to organize the text. We also used GUI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Probems we encountered
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It broke randomly and seemed to be obsessed with catching or throw all tiny baby IOExceptions. We also pulled an all-nighter (#hardcore).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we stayed motivated to complete our program (#sleep is for the weak). We are also only a two people group but felt like we made a lot of progress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We haven&rsquo;t done a GUI for awhile, so of course, we had to relearn it. We also learned that at 6 am, caffeine doesn&rsquo;t work anymore.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What&rsquo;s next for Digital Therapist?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It will go online as a website anyone can access and will continue to grow as professionals will improve it.
