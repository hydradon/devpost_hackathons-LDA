                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Over 32 million Americans - almost 1 out of 10 - are illiterate. When we try and register for jobs or services, we always have to fill out forms - but not everyone has the means or the ability to do so, whether it's a language barrier or a physical disability. Our app seeks to fix that problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Comotium, based off of the latin word for "easy", helps people fill out their forms through voice. It scans in a picture of a paper form, finds out where the fields to fill things in are, and then prompts the user for the answers, and fills it all in at the end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used rev.ai for the real-time speech processing, Microsoft Azure for the backend, Google Cloud for the speech-to-text processing, and built it in Android Studio using flutter.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a lot of trouble doing real-time speech processing and knowing when and how to stop listening to the user, and then start re-prompting once we had a new question to ask. Luckily, we were able to get it working!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're really happy about the integrations that we had in this project - all of them are integral to how the product works, and we feel like we were really able to get a good use case that help others by combining these.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of the technologies used in the project were new to all of us - none of us had any prior experience with flutter, and we also how to work with the (really cool) rev.ai API, and audio streams.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Comotium
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make our form field detection better, save forms so that you can make a central repository of forms that everyone can choose from, and implement the ability to detect corners on a page.
