                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a application that focused on the act of focusing! So we started brainstorming and looked into brain games mixed with a set schedule to keep on tracking while studying.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently our app is a proof of concept and uses a basic GUI to notify you that you have been studying for a certain amount of time and gives you the oppertunity to take a small break by selecting a random "brain game" from our list. After another set time the user is notified that their break is over and is asked to continue studying, we think this will greatly increase some students productivity as they will be able to step away for a second and get other creative juices flowing hopefully increasing the overall focus and quailty of work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app is a somewhat simple mock up made in python to show how easy this would be to implement!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had quite a bit of trouble using commands from easygui as there is not much documentation on how it works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we we're able to get past the very picky loops for python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Brainstorming is very important!
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully if others show interest we can make a much more clean UI with exact data for our timing system.
