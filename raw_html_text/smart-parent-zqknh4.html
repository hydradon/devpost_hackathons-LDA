                    Inspiration
                </h3>
                <p>
                    This project was inspired after a small local dealership went out of business for having multiple cars not being repossessed after a customer never made it&rsquo;s monthly payments and stop context with the dealership.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Smart Repo seeks to improve the dealership repo process. Dealerships will be able to keep track of the cars that need to be repossessed. This will save them a lot of time and money.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project was made with an Express framework with javascript. Using a &ldquo;Smart Car&rdquo; API we are able to obtain the location of a vehicle. Google Maps API was used to graphically show where the car is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially thought we could build our frontend using Wix code but it quickly became limited with what we had in mind. We had to pivot and move to using javascript to build our UI. We only became aware of the Smart Car API at this hackathon  so we had to familiarize ourselves with this new technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we&rsquo;re proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A user can get the exact location of the vehicle and have it display on a map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We&rsquo;ve never worked with any software related to vehicles. So working with something outside our comfort zone allowed us to learn much about this entire car industry. We learned how to use the smart car api and google maps api.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What&rsquo;s next for Smart Repo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We see a promising future for Smart Repo. We plan rolling out a beta to small dealerships in our local area and getting feedback from them and adding any features that they might find helpful.
