                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app is inspired by the widely-accepted idea that college students don't get enough sleep but with the hope of shedding more light onto the idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app lets you monitor your own sleep patterns easily right from your web browser and compare these to other students at your college and colleges around the country. For the first time, we'll have data visualizations of how students sleep around the country and have the ability to compare these across campuses and examine how sleep schedules may vary over the course of the academic year.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My three team members and I built SleepEasy during the WUHack hackathon event in September, 2015. It is a full stack web app with a functioning Google Chrome extension which relays data to our server which in turn provides data for our website which displays all of our charts and other data visualizations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first attempted to develop using D3 for our visualizations. This proved much more difficult than we originally anticipated but we hope to return to it when we have more time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our extensive backend required substantial work from our team and hit many bumps along the way but now runs as smoothly as we always needed it to. We also developed our first ever Google Chrome extension.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to interface with C3 to make our graphs as well as Google's APIs for their Chrome extensions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SleepEasy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We don't plan to stop developing after the hackathon. The obvious next step will be to develop an Add-on for Mozilla Firefox to accompany our Chrome extension. We also want to expand upon our knowledge of graphing capabilities and create a greater number of more eloquent visualizations. Another clear step forward is the development of a mobile app so that users can update their sleep data from their phones as well as from their web browsers.
