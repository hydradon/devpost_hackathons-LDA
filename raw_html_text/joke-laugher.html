                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I find that frequently, nobody laughs at my sick jokes or puns, so I decided to create a skill for Alexa, so somebody will always appreciate my jokes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After opening the program with "Alexa, laugh at my joke", you say your joke, Alexa will respond, then you finish with the punchline.  Alexa will always laugh.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Amazon's Alexa skill-building utilities, as well as AWS's lambda functions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since I'd never done anything like this before, it took a while to understand how the skills work, how to develop a conversation, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to create a proper conversation between the user and Alexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use Node.js more effectively, as well as develop a skill for Alexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Joke Laugher
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hope I can use what I learned to create more skills, and more cool projects.
                </p>
