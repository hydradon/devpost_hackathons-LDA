                </h2>
                <p>
                    TravelSafe is a smartphone travel solution designed for the prevention of kidnapping, property theft, and ensures that you, another person, or an item safely arrives at its intended destination by a given time. In order to assess the market potential of such a product, we looked to some publicly available statistics. 
In a 1998 study of parents' worries by pediatricians at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, nearly three-quarters of parents said they feared their children might be abducted. One-third of parents said this was a frequent worry -- a degree of fear greater than that held for any other concern, including car accidents, sports injuries, or drug addiction. Every 40 seconds in the United States, a child becomes missing or is abducted, and in 2001, 840,279 people (adults and children) were reported missing to the FBI's National Crime Information Center (NCIC). The FBI estimates that 85 to 90 percent of those (roughly 750,000 people or 2,000 per day) reported missing were children.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With TravelSafe, you can be assured that you, your loved ones, or your belongings will make it to their intended destination. If you, your loved ones, or your belongings do not make it to their intended destination, TravelSafe will send a customizable message to a specified contact along with the current coordinates of the smartphone being used. 
Not only does TravelSafe have applications for safety, but also accountability. Imagine you are shipping a package, or you want to make sure that a lent out vehicle is really going to its intended location. With TravelSafe, all you would have to do is place the phone with an appropriate battery bank in the package or the vehicle, and you are instantly updated with the location at the given time if it does not arrive where intended and are able to track the route taken by the device.
Whether you are sending your child to school or just want to make sure a package arrives on time, you can look to TravelSafe for a fast, easy, and intuitive accountability solution.

                    For this app, a variety of applications were employed, including Android Studio, Audacity, and Photoshop.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were given only 36 hours to come up with an idea and turn that idea into a functional product that would be ready for use in the real world.  Our product had to both work reliably, and also be user-friendly and easy to use. In the real world, a product without both of these crucial elements will fail.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to present a project that would have a real social impact, would have a real use, would have a sizeable and verified market niche, would work, and would be user-friendly.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We explored the means and methods of Android App development using the marvelapp platform as well as Android Studio. Server protocols were explored. We also learned how to use Firebase API to develop real-time databases as well as back-end servers for our app. Node.js was used to manipulate the Twilio API.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are planning to improve the user interface, add features like the alerting of local police based on the current location, live recording after the panic button is triggered, and wearable/standalone device technology.
