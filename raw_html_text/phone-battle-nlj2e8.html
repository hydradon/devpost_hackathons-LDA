                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea comes from car cards where the winner is based on the best specs
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It compares a phones specs with some other phone through a wifi-connection
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally the app should should make a Wi-fi-connection p2p and then tell the other phone which Brand/model they are. During development we had some problems due to our lack of experience with Android development. Therefore we made a prototype which fakes this interaction.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the phones to communicate p2p. Eventually we got this working, but could not implement the rest of the functionalities in time.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got the p2p connection working
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Do not start developing in environments that you are not familiar with - for next hackathon.

                    Compare the prototype with the actually functionalities.
