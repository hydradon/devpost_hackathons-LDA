                    After attending the Internet of Things Workshop and learning about what could be done with the ESP8266, our team decided to take on the challenge of learning how to setup and program a working project with the ESP. 
We started with a C program that reads the light sensor from the connected to the ESP and a website made with PHP as the back-end language. The C program sends the information coming from the ESP to the website using a post request. After some time trying to put together an API using PHP to handle the post request coming from the C program, we decided that it would be a better option to go with Flask as the back-end language. We then remade the entire website using Flask as the back-end language. Other challenges we faced were trying to integrating the back-end and front-end using Flask, which none of us have done before. We then worked on setting up the front of the project. Through this, we implemented a lot of keyframe animation functions and other css styling tools which allowed us to learn more about css. We ran into some challenges with creating the specific shapes need; however, in the end we eventually prevailed and got the shapes and animations working the way we intended.
