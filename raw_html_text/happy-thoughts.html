                    Why Happy Thoughts?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I already talk with my Amazon Echo daily, having set up rules so that when I say "Alexa, I'm home," it would turn on the lights and reply, "Welcome home!" I found positively cheerful to come back to every day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why not take it a step further? I want something that can inspire me, cheer me up, and make me feel like I'm ready to tackle the day. Now you can ask Alexa for a Happy Thought, and she'll supply one. Ask her to cheer you up, and she'll be by your side. Ask her to encourage you, and she will.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hope that those with depression or anxiety can find this skill and try putting a Happy Thought in their life.
