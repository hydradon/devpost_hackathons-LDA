                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game was inspired by medieval times, and games like X-COM and Darkest Dungeon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This generates a random map with units of various types spawned on it. Twp players take turns moving on a computer, trying to eliminate their opponent.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We put this together with Unity, using things like Piskel and Github to share code and assets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us have extensive experience in Unity, especially on this type of project. We had some issues with the collaborate function as well. The biggest thing code wise was getting a map with units on it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The random map generator worked very well. On top of that, the issues we did have, we were able to work around. We are also proud of all of the sprites we used for this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about how Unity works, and how to use Github to share all of our files. We also learned to work together as a team, and to alternate sleeping.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Medieval Skeveil
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The future is uncertain for this project, as we might keep working on it or we might not. In any case, this was certainly an enjoyable experience.
