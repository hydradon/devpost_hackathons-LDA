                <p>
                    The platform has a lot of potential, some of the ideas we have:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Community Contribution: be able to add more skills (kinds of knowledge), and add content of good practices as mentor/mentoree
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Connecting Ways: be able to create messenger groups for the first contact, later be able to meet on online video conferences.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Gamification: be able to be scored on your performance as a mentor/mentoree, how many time you spend learning and teaching, and Rankings that can be shared between your FB friends
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Security: is very important to take on when you are connecting people, there is always the probability of misconduct from the mentor/mentoree. Through ranking system most of the cases could be avoided and with a flagging system quick actions could be taken if misconduct is reported.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sustainability: a way to encourage being a mentor is pretty important. So a Wallet system could be introduced, each certain amount of mentoring will give you coins. And to get a mentor you will be paying coins. Like interchanging knowledge. And also be able to buy coins.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    "Mentorik", from where it comes that name?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everybody needs access to a mentor, no matter from where you come.

                    On Cholan Mayan:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Woman - Ixik
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Man - Winik
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Black - Ik'
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        White - Sik
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Some Mayan words finished on the suffix 'IK', like in a way representing inclusion on just one syllable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Talking about the importance of inclusion and be able to give access to opportunities to everybody.
