                <p>
                    We were always annoyed when we saw some article / media / etc online and went back to find it later, only to find that the content had been removed for any myriad of reasons. We wanted to create a dependable internet where,
                    <em>
                        if you had seen it once, you could see it again
                    </em>
                    , as many of us internet users have become used to.

                    StashCacheDash runs as a browser extension, and will automatically send off the main articles or media of sites that you visit to IPFS for archiving, after the main page has finished loading. You can run the IPFS storage node in the cloud, your home server, or directly on the device where you are browsing the web. Once you need to get a file, you can use the in-browser interface to reload the main components of the saved pages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, you have settings for specific sites to archive and how long to keep items.
