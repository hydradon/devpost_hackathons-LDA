                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made weird models that we felt we wanted to push around, so we built a game around that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It has the player controlling three people to push three other people into a fire pit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Unity Engine to make the game. We used Autodesk Character Generator to make the models.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to get the physics working properly and to have characters die properly.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                    Teamwork skills and making models

                    Letting multiple people play the game as each individual on the team.
