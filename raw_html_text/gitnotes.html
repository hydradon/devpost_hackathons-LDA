                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were learning how to use git for hackathons, and then we realized version control could also be utilized on not only computer projects, but class notes as well! So we sat down and made this thing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a platform that stores notes that can be uploaded by anyone. Users can propose changes to those notes, where the differences of the notes are clearly shown. The original owner of the notes can then choose to accept or reject such changes to improve its quality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GitNotes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allow gitnotes to utilize not only txt files, but also other formats which may incorporate various media files. Rating systems can allow users to find quality notes, while online editors allow users to propose changes instantaneously.
