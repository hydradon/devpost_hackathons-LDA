                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I always remembered having interest in choosing my own adventure as a kid and having fun with it while learning would be great.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adventurous is a choose your own adventure game where you learn some uncommon knowledge about animals. You also learn to treat things, even those you may fear, with kindness, and do some financial math.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I didn't know if this was good enough.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I actually made something that wasn't a class project and that I could also enjoy playing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that it is alright to do something that isn't such a breakthrough in ideas, but is very fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Adventurous
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'll probably be implementing front-end as well as adding more scenarios.
