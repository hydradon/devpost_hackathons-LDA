                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Perusing through eBay, I often compare multiple posts for the item I search for and mentally compile an average price given what I currently see, and from searches in the past few days.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This search process is cumbersome and prone to human judgment error, so our webapp takes pricing data of the item sold (such as iPhone) in the past week. It compiles daily and overall averages and  then it looks at the current average price (today) of the item on my wishlist and suggests whether right now is a good time to buy or not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python for backend analytics and django for frontend design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning javascript and integrating backend with frontend were a few challenges.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a product I would actually look forward to using.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We earned a lot about web development.
                </p>

                    What's next for ebae
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully we can continue refining this by perhaps predicting future prices by looking at historical trends.
