                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The need for Virtual Reality is here and is extending well beyond gaming. Virtual Reality(VR) is a vibrant experience that appeals to all age groups. Also, public speaking is the most widely known phobia now. Public speaking skills are the key to professional development, but the practice is infrequent.
As per the 2016 survey of Association for Talent Development the average training cost for training an employee is $1252. A huge number right? Training an employee is not just costly, but tedious and time consuming too. 
Although it&rsquo;s increasingly accepted that retailers must give their employees a reason to stay, if they want to ultimately provide an excellent customer experience, 31% of all the frontline retail employees still say they don&rsquo;t receive any formal workplace training. This is mainly because of the lack of resources to practice and therefore caves the need for Visionary to fit in.
Virtual Reality (VR) does a great job in conveying a space into an environment. For a retail store specifically, we place a retailer into a highly stylized and branded environment basically mimicking the showroom experience and offering them a surprising delight. We do this to make the retailer learn how to make a connection with the customers and to discover how to conduct themselves in a more confident and professional manner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application mimics the showroom experience for a retail employee wherein he can practice his pitch about the product, talk about different gadgets, mobile plans and customizations available virtually. The speech given by employee is evaluated based on different parameters and a confidence score is assigned for every parameter and for an individual as a whole. 
An individual who scores low in a particular parameter, can then concentrate on that particular segment and improve his score. 
How is it better than what&rsquo;s already existing? 
The existing method of teaching requires the employees to answer a set of questions based out of a tutorial; which can be cleared easily by a person knowing the concepts. But the application that we have developed, ensures that the employee is assigned a score only when he uses the designated &lsquo;keywords&rsquo; during his pitch to the customer. This way, maximum efficiency of customer engagement can be achieved. 
Consider an employee who has amazing soft skills but fails to include information about &lsquo;Latency&rsquo;, &lsquo;Download/Upload Speed&rsquo; etc to a customer who is interested in buying a broadband service. Our application ensures that the employee is assigned a score only when he includes these keywords during his practice session, thus ensuring that the employee is well-aware of all the information for efficient customer engagement.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed this to be used as a plugin into the already existing retail app for Metro by T-mobile wherein the store customers go through different ways of recreating fear and excitement that they might experience when they are branding about the product with the customers. 
The app gives the feedback on the following areas based on the speech of the users: 
&bull; Impact 
&bull; Brevity 
&bull; Style 
&bull; Soft Skills 
Depending on these criteria, the user&rsquo;s performance is reviewed by the app. The app uses speech-to-text and other vocal technology to analyze the speech and provide feedback for the user. Once the app has converted the speech to a body of text, we created several Machine Learning algorithms to analyze this and provide meaningful and understandable results to the user. This allows the user to quantify their performance and improve areas of their speech each time.
