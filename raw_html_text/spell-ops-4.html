                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were at a loss for what to do at the start of this project. We spent the first 5 or 6 hours contemplating and trying out different ideas. Eventually we decided to make a game. Inspired by a video of the Warcraft 3 mod Warlocks we decided to make a Side-on wizard duelling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game allows multiple people to connect and battle wizards. The aim of the game is to knock your opponents of the platform. You can move left and right using A and D, and you can jump using W. You can fire a spell using by clicking. Spells will fire towards the mouse position. Spells send any opponents that are hit by it flying back. You can charge up a spell by holding down the mouse button. The more charged a spell is the more it will knock your opponents back. The platform that you are duelling on is gradually crumbling away making it harder and harder to stay on.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it in the Unity game engine using their 2D tools. The graphics we all created in Photoshop.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Deciding on a project was an initial challenge. 
Learning how to use Unity took a while however once we got the hang of it we made quite good progress.
