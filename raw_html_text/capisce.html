                </h2>
                <p>
                    Students often find themselves in the all too familiar scenario of not understanding something,
yet simultaneouisly also too shy to say so. They may not have a good opportunity to voice their concerns
(teacher moves on and student doesn't want to make him backtrack)
or may not even know the right question to ask (how do I know what I don't know?)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is built mainly using node.js &amp; chart.js to set up a simple 2 page website for the student view and teacher view.
The student view allows students to enter their level of understanding whereas the teacher view displays all of the results in a nice pie chart
