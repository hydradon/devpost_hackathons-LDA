                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are 122.532 people on the waitlist for an organ donation in the U.S. Every year, the waitlist keeps growing faster than the number of donors. We decided to utilize technology to increase the chances of becoming a donor, and helping the people on the waitlist.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website collects contact info from the donors, recipients, potential donors and potential recipients using a simple form. Let us call the person visiting the website user1. User1 is offered a chance to contact one of these groups, based on his or her selection. A text message is sent to another user in the database, providing the contact info of user1. This way the two users can share their experiences and concerns about organ donation.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were planning to use HTML5, CSS, PHP, JAVASCRIPT, and MYSQL. We also used Adobe Illustrator to design logos, and Powerpoint to present our idea.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came up with the idea too late.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea has a lot of potential to save lives, and we are going to work hard on completing it even outside the hackathon.

                    Never give up.
