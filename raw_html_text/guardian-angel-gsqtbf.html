                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recent school shootings that have plagued American media with their brutality and gruesomeness
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is able to calculate the fastest way out of a building, using alerts that users on the app can give to one another
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using java and a neural net we were able to develop an algorithm that is capable to finding the safest exit out of a building
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some concurrency issues because we were using fire base in order to store all our user data
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create a neural net that is able to utilize user input to provide the safest path out of a building in case of a disaster
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about concurrency errors that occur with java and fire base and how to resolve them using thread safe algorithms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Guardian Angel
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the future of Guardian Angel we plant to launch the app around the world, because this app relies on mass user input in order for it to work.
We can also improve it by adding an AI that can guide the user out of the building by talking to them.
