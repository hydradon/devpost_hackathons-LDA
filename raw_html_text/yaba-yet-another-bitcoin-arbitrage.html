                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Detecting arbitrage in bitcoin is particularly enticing because of the large amount of API support many of these cryptocurrency exchanges provide.

                    What it does

                <p>
                    Returns a sequence of trades that would result in a very low risk profit.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the custom search algorithm we had to develop in order to find an optimal path given modeled exchange rates over time. Many search algorithms, such as Bellman-Ford and Dijkstra's, solve individual requirements, but there are no well known algorithms that solve a widest-path, time-sensitive search problem with multiple goal states.
