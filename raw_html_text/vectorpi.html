                <h2>
                    Motivation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are reports across university campuses and cities alike that bike thefts are at an all-time high. You never think it's going to happen to you until it does. My bike was once stolen as a child and the only reason I was able to find the people responsible for taking it was because a few friends saw that some strangers had taken it. We wanted to integrate this watchful eye into the bike itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Enter VectorPI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the intention of being integrated into the framework of the handlebars of a bike, VectorPI is able to detect how close someone is to the bike and if the bike is moving, track its location, and take photo/video of the potential thief all in real time. Visualize this data through VPI's website that is also mobile-friendly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application of our IoT protective bike security systems consists of specific integrations between software and hardware to increase its effectiveness. As far as hardware, our security measures consist of an HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor and a BNO555 orientation sensor. These specific sensors allow us to detect if someone is approaching the bike or directly above it for prolonged period of time. Once this specific motion is detected, the built in camera begins recording video and taking pictures of the thief as well as alerting the owner of the bicycle/vehicle. To ensure that the security system is not reporting a false negative, the BNO555's built in gyroscope detects heavy movement in the bike's orientation, which is indicative of the bike being moved or transported.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The algorithm developed by the team implements GPS tracking of the vehicle, which can be used by authorities to pinpoint its location. As an added measure of security and convenience, we plan to add a fingerprint scanner to enable and deactivate VectorPI as necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All of the sensors are connected to an Arduino UNO and then interfaced to a Raspberry Pi so that it can collect and manage the data into a cloud database (we used firebase), as well as record video when necessary. Therefore, our Python code on the Raspberry Pi is responsible for all information being delivered.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, our web app connects to the database and consists of a data visualization dashboard, giving the owner all necessary information on the position, security, and whereabouts of their bicycle.
