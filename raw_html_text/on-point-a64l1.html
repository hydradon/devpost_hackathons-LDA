                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team members recognized how difficult it is to choose an outfit in the morning. This is because, for fashion, we want to have the confidence boost from being fashionable, but also be practical and prepared for the weather. In the morning, we don't have time to elaborately plan out an outfit, and we wanted to design a website to aid with that process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given a date and a location, the app will figure out which outfits are optimal for those conditions. You can also find the prices and places to buy these clothes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to integrate the Edison board and its temperature and wifi location capabilities, but unfortunately we had issues with our computers not recognizing the boards and it took a long time to troubleshoot. Also, this was our first hackathon for everyone so we had to spend a bit of time figuring out the basics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We focused on getting it done and making everything look aesthetically pleasing. We are proud of ourselves for accomplishing that, even though much of the backend doesn't work as well as we'd like it to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That making a website is both easier and harder than we thought.
