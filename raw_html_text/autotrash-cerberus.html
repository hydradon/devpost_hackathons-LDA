                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Segragating trash is prone to human error and is a thankless activity. We realised that we could easily solve this by taking the decision making out of the user's hand and teaching a neural network to identify and segragate the trash.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    It aut segregates trash
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using RaspberryPi and neural networks with some custom hardware hacking
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Marrying hardware and software is always a challenge. To get it all working together did take us some time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works! The trash can successfully recognises and autotrashes over 1000 objects approproately between recycle and compost
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>

                    What's next for AutoTrash - Cerberus
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Make a production ready design and go to market strategy. Also work on retraining the model via collective data of all trash cans.
