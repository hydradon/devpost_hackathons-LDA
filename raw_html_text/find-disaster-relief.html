                    What it does

                    FiND is a tool that would be used by officials at relief camps across the world during a disaster. A new arrival at a camp would enter their information into our site, which would be saved into our database. They would also enter the names of loved ones they are looking for. Our system would return any matches with who they are looking for and show what camp they are staying at if they had been added to our database somewhere else. For security, the person being looked for would have to confirm that they too know the person seeking them.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front end was built in HTML/CSS and Javascript. The backend and database used python and MongoDB.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge (being that we have limited Javascript, and Jquery experience) was getting the data from the form to be sent to the backend. We attempted for a long time to write the data into a .txt file that would be sent, but this did not work, and we realized too late that we should have posted to python using jquery ajax.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We worked hard to execute an idea we are proud of and we learned a lot about programming that we did not know before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all improved our elementary programming skills in various languages, and learned how to use the Mongo API.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We would love to complete this tool now that we know what steps need to be taken.
