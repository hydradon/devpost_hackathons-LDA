                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I focused on the ITDZ Berlin challenged.  Currently in Berlin, it is difficult to get an appointment for services not limited to marriage, driving license, medical appointments etc.  They are all booked and it is very hard to get an appointment that fits one's time so they are often forced to pick a time slot that doesn't even fit them even if it means no showing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improves the current booking system, by providing statistics in the past showing what months were more active, sends SMS reminders on register and day of appointment to confirm.  Visualizes different data over time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Node.js for the backend, Angular, JQuery, Bootstrap for front-end and D3.js for visualization.  Twillio API to message users and Google Vision for Facial Recognition
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    I had to do the work by myself and I spent a lot of time thinking about how to structure my database and optimizing my code.
