                <p>
                    The Pine Ridge Indian Reservation is one of the least talked about regions of the United States. However, upon visiting the reservation this Spring, I became very aware of what life looks like in the poorest county in the country. Despite the hardships that these people undergo due to no fault of their own, they have one of the strongest, most caring communities I have ever witnessed. Everyone is family and anyone will stop what they are doing to help a neighbor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How is Pine Ridge Provides unique?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pine Ridge Provides is a
                    <strong>
                        server-side rendered React application
                    </strong>
                    that leverages
                    <strong>
                        Facebook login
                    </strong>
                    for streamlined user authentication, and is specifically tailored to the conditions of the Pine Ridge Reservation. It allows community members to more efficiently give and receive aid in times of need, but takes into account the unique living conditions of the area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For instance, it does not utilize typical address fields for location because most people on the reservation do not have a formal address, but must instead describe where they live. It also keeps users anonymous so that they are able to reach the most amount of people in the community, without having to attach their name to their request.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, the application is server rendered so that users interact with a static end-product, meaning faster load times and fewer page reloads in an area where good internet access is not always readily available.
