                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Valentine's Day is coming up, and what better way to show your love for someone than sending them a generic, randomly generated message? Lukewarm Greeting Cards are best for casual and lighthearted exchange, maybe as a fun precursor to the actual, lovingly written/purchased card you are hiding behind your back. Or send your loved one a Lukewarm Greeting Card to distract them from the fact that you've forgotten to get them a real card, and quickly scribble one out while they chuckle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My main goal was to finish something, so I came up with a small project idea that I knew I could finish, but also be entertaining to work on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Depending on the type of card the user chooses, the code will randomly choose a pre-written sentence skeleton and fill in the blanks with randomly chosen words from an array of appropriate, but slightly off-center synonyms. The completed sentence is then displayed on the website in all its glory.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a rather simple website, content is styled with CSS and functions are in Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I tried to make the website as responsive as possible, while also making it look aesthetically pleasing on both desktop and mobile. I had some issues with scaling and organizing all the information on smaller devices, but eventually solved most of the problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm most proud that I've completed something! Even if it's a tiny one, it's a whole, working project nonetheless.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had actually not been aware of the transition-duration style property, so I was able to make smoother "animations."
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Lukewarm Greeting Cards
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Options to have an image instead of a solid color for the background, better way to send than manually print-screening and saving, and even more exciting occasions and holidays to send lukewarm messages for.
                </p>
