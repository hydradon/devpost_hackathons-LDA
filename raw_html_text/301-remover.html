                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hated clicking broken links from these shortened URL providers that are a frequently going down or being sold.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It reads all of the links on a webpage upon load, determines which URLs are shortened, and requests the original URLs from a server with an enormous database of known shortened URLs and their original links.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This chrome extension was built using javascript, and it communicates with a Python server using json requests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was a challenge communicating with the server and properly replacing the links after they were returned.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We also implemented a link counter that displays to the user the number of links that have been replaced on a page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned: how to make a chrome extension, how to replace href attributes of link elements on a webpage in real time, and how to communicate with a python server from a chrome extension.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for 301 Remover
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, we'd like to implement functionality on https sites, poll the existing shortening sites when we find a link that we don't already know about, and actually launch it as a chrome extension.
