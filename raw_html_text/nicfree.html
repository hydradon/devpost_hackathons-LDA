                    inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to help people succeed in life and choose a lifestyle where it isn't leading them to failure.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app we made is about nicotine addiction and how to get help if you are someone who relates to that. The app provides pieces of information that show facts about nicotine and how bad smoking is for you. It also provides a simple game to play to release any urge of getting a buzz.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We coded the app and used a program to help make the game.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Designing and storming into a new software clueless.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to plan better and next time we will be more experienced about the programs we used.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we think the app is a good idea, it could possibly go on to the app market and try to get teens to not be pressured into addicting habits.
