                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I know many people who are are affected by different forms of colorblindness. How they have accomplished so much despite their tendency to be chromatically challenged makes them very inspiring.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are two features to this tool. First, we are looking to raise awareness of how people affected by different forms of colorblindness see the world in different ways. Being able to understand these differences is key to being able to building good color palettes that are able to accommodate all. Second, this is a tool to attempt to aide those that are affected by different kinds of colorblindness to be able to better perceive colors that they would normally have more difficulty differentiating. We achieve this by color shifting the camera preview display as a function of the saturation and hue of the original image.

                    This was our first time using tools such as Android Studio. Furthermore, none of us are computer science majors - we are composed of a biomedical engineer and electrical engineers.
