                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Virtual reality is very close to being a reality, and it is a very interesting subject to play around with. That and everybody
loves zombie games.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses a myo to control the main character. Each arm and each leg are controlled separately. The Oculus Rift was intended to
be used to provide an immersive experience, but there were some technical difficulties.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Three myos, the Unity game engine, and the *Oculus Rift. The Unity game engine provided the basic game functionality, which was then extended to take input from the myos.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Oculus Rift could be used to view the environment but only as a second monitor and not as a an immersive 3D viewer.
The Unity game engine was very buggy, and didn't play well with our computers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The animation of the hand being closed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Oculus Rift is not very compatible with lower budget computers as it needs a more powerful graphics card to run. It also isn't compatible with certain older versions of Unity.
                </p>

                    Also the Oculus Rift being successfully integrated. Better UI. Better AI. More expansive environment.
