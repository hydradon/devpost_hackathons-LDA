                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Southwest Airlines challenge was to create something to help people that don't travel often or at all, so I created a website that they can visit to help relax and/or sleep while on the flight. Many people are stressed or have anxiety when it comes to flying, so there are some tips to reduce those stresses by preparing ahead of time, as well as what to do in flight.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The home page links to breathing exercises, tips on how stay calm, tips on how to sleep on a plane, and relaxing playlists.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used HTML and CSS to create the site and Firebase to host the site.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult figuring out how to know what software to use, and it was hard learning how to use HTML and CSS to put the content I want and make it look pretty
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I made everything from scratch for the first time, so I'm proud to have been able to build it from the ground up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use CSS for visual aspects and how to host using Firebase
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Plane Sleep
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hope to make a mobile app so that people can actually use it while on an airplane
