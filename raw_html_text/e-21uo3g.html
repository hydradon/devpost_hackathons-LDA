                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    E++ is inspired by the programming language Piet. Piet is a low-level stack machine language predicated on shifting colors and image files. Unfortunately, there are no compatible editors and interpreters available online, as it's a very niche (and generally useless) language. It's also pretty hard to learn and use due to the idiosyncratic tendencies of its creator. I wanted to create an easy-to-use visual stack-machine coding language with its own editor and interpreter.

                <p>
                    This project is an IDE for a language called E++. It allows for the drawing of pixels onto a grid via a GUI, which saves to a
                    <code>
                        txt
                    </code>
                    file that can be run via the interpreter also contained within the IDE. It has roughly 20 machine instructions and 3 registers, which each have save/load/print functionality, as well as basic mathematical operations.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used tkinter and pygame with python for the GUI. It was a python view with two models - one for the editor and one for the interpreter.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    TKinter can be really tedious to configure properly.
