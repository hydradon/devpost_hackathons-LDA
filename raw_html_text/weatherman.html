                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hated to always open another tab and check the weather for events that we wanted to go to to make sure it was not raining.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a chrome extension that displays the predicted weather for dates on websites within a week from the current date.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it from scratch using Javascript and APIs and uploaded it as a chrome extension.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first major project using Javascript. Prior to this, none of us had any real javascript experience so it was challenging to learn the language while creating a product. In addition, one weather retrieval API posed a really difficult error that caused a road block for multiple hours. Even after getting help from people experienced with javascript, the problem persisted so we switched APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first chrome extension for all of us, and first experience with javascript. Getting the text to replace inside the website and parsing the dates was a real challenge and accomplishment for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Javascript, APIs, callback functions, async, chrome extensions
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Weatherman
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Parsing more date formats, "tomorrow" or "this ___day", parsing times, parsing locations. Or maybe another app that uses a similar algorithm to display a map next to locations.
                </p>
