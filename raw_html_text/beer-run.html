                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a way for folks to get the beer they want, as soon as possible!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You just order the beer you want and we handle the rest! Your order will be sent to a local driver who will deliver your beer to you, as long as you are 21 or over.
