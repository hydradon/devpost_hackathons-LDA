                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build something similar to MyFitnessPal that didn't require user input. With NFC payments, data could be sent from the seller to the customer containing calorie and nutrition data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was supposed to send food data as a json file and be stored locally on the user's Android phone, but we didn't get that far. In it's current state we only read and parse a local json file.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio with Java to write an Android app. We began development of a Linux app in java to run on Raspbian, but it does not work and is not included in the GitHub repository.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our primary challenge was dealing with data transmission between a Raspberry Pi and an Android device. Ideally, we would have NFC initiate a Bluetooth connection to send the data we wanted. Unfortunately, we were unfamiliar with Bluetooth and NFC protocols and were unable to transmit any data between the two devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time dealing with Android Studio and developing an Android app. Although our plans did not pan out, we all gained a basic familiarity with the Android development environment. Essentially, we are proud of what we learned from the experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As mentioned above, we learned how to develop a basic android app and store data locally.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HackPrinceton
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Now that we have some basic familiarity, we'd like to actually build the app we had envisioned but perhaps using actual NFC transmissions and completing both the Android and Linux apps.
