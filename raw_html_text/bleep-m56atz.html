                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to create a web experience where everyone has a comfortable web experience.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides users a safe way to browse the web by filtering unwanted content. By creating a Chrome extension which reads each web page and identifies explicit or offensive images and text, we are able to filter and replace components of each webpage with friendlier content.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project utilizes the Google Cloud Platform Safe Search recognition library. In addition, it also uses text scanning to detect words. In addition, it depends widely on the chrome extension libraries, which allow for the storage of user preferences and access to various webpages. Lastly, it also utilizes the Giphy API to provide substitute content.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found the GCP docs quite challenging, as well as navigation of the DOM, which was complicated because of the constant manipulation.
