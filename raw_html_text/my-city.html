                <p>
                    More than half of the world&rsquo;s population now live in urban areas. By 2050, that figure will have risen to 6.5 billion people - two-thirds of all humanity. Increased urbanisation means that a higher number of people will be relying on their local town/city councils for support when it comes to resolving problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tackling eParticpation isn&rsquo;t a particularly new problem, in fact there are already well established systems such as
                    <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/City-Infrastructure/311-Cases" rel="nofollow">
                        311
                    </a>
                    . The problem however is these systems have a high barrier of entry due to the requirement to download &amp; install a mobile app to report problems. This requirement potentially isolates some users who might not have the ability to perform this step, and could be tempted to not bother at all due to the effort required.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is where MyCity will play a vital role in facilitating community participation in the reporting of problems found throughout the community.

                <p>
                    MyCity is accessible entirely through Facebook Messenger in the form of a Bot and captures all the required data in a seamless way using emerging technologies such as Machine learning and Natural language processing. This means that no extra apps need to be downloaded and kept on the individuals phone for when an opportunity arises that needs to be reported.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have also gamified MyCity to incentivised users to report more and more issues using a point and level scoring system.

                <p>
                    The data collected will help city councils to identify and act on issues. However, showing all the data can be overwhelming. To tackle this, we focus on the main need &ldquo;What are the biggest issues now, and where?&rdquo; by showing a list of prioritised issues and visualised map. Users are also able to see individual report and notify citizens when something has been done.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apart from reactive work, we would also like to enable city councils to be proactive in preventing issues and measuring efforts. We have the idea to provide generated insights for them, for example telling them if issues are increasing or decrease, current trending issue and the progress of handling issues.

                    Elasticsearch
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Elasticsearch was chosen due to its speed and simplicity when trying to query large datasets. Due to the large about of free text data that is collected by MyCity we needed a way to effectively perform simple NLP (Natural Language Processing) to extract key words from large custom text fields.

                <p>
                    We found we had issues getting a model up and running and exposed over an API due to time constraints. This meant that we opted too instead make use of the

                    Messenger Bot is providing an image_url of the photo attachment. 
In order to send this attachment to Google Cloud Vision, we first tried to send the url to Google Cloud Vision.
It couldn't extract the labels because Facebook is using Image CDN. URL of images are constantly changing.
A solution is to send the image data as base64.
