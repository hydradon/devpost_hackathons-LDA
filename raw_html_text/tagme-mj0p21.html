                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our teammate, having arrived from Alberta (to Ontario) very recently, hardly knew any people in the area.  After a brainstorming session, we decided that there was a need for a social media platform to allow people with common interests to meet one another.  What started off as a way for new individuals to acclimatize into their communities, is now a a means of connecting local residents with each other too!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tagme is an online platform that allows users to connect with one another simply by choosing their interests (or tags)!  Our application takes care of the rest - by connecting people based on geographical location and other preferences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So far, we've used HTML, CSS, and Javascript, with a few modified Bootstrap templates to create a platform that is aesthetically pleasing and extremely efficient.  In the future, we plan on incorporating a programming language such as Python to finish creating our algorithm that matches people based on their chosen tags.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All three of us had little practical experience with the concept of programming.  After immersive lessons and self-study, we soon came forth with what we have today and plan to continue to develop this concept.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After simply 12 hours, we were excited to be create a website (mainly front-end) capable of displaying information aesthetically, while providing many tools such as a "Login" page, virtual dashboard for a user, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, Javascript (node.js), Git, and more.  Effective teamwork played a crucial role in the succcess of this endeavour.  Having manifested an idea into a reality is something all of us are truly proud of!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tagme
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think that Tagme has immense potential for the future.  There are many ways that Tagme can be turned into a full fledged scalable venture.  As it grows, there are some areas that could be greatly improved, given more time and care.  The first step would be to implement and optimize the back-end component in order for the website to run effectively.  The next area we are going to focus on would be the google-maps specific features that aid in the event-planning process.  As a whole, we would like to see this idea placed on the internet for all to use.
