                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenge was to help developers in their daily life, by perhaps making workflow more efficient
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can define a project location, and what you are searching for and it finds those classes, methods, etc. for you, without you having to even know the name, just things like return types, parameters, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We exclusively used java for the code and javafx for the GUI
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Parsing the .java files into objects proved to be quite a challenge, since there are so many angles you have to cover (enums, interfaces, etc.) it's not as straight-forward as one might think
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We applied quite a lot of theory we learned in university (data-structures, algorithms, patterns, etc.)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hate myself and everyone around me
                </p>

                    What's next for findify
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Perhaps try to incorporate it as a plugin in IntelliJ
                </p>
