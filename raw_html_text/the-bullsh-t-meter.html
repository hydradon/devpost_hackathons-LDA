                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Startup websites all seem to be "Revolutionizing the world by providing innovative digital solutions and encouraging progress through technological innovation."
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a tool that analyzes how many of these cliches ("innovative", "digital solutions", "saving the world") are present in a website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the tool on Django python framework, with a ReactJS front end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially hoped to use the Watson API to integrate more advanced Natural Language Processing, but were unable to do so because of difficulty and time constraints.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that We're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our last-minute pivot into a new idea, when our initial idea proved too much to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building an Ethereum marketplace is incredibly difficult :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Bullsh*t Meter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on refining this into a product that startups can use to improve the quality of their websites.
