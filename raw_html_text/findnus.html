                    What inspired your app?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What if you could have an app that gave you the shortest path between 2 places in NUS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What does it do?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app uses the google map API along with data provided by us to allow for indoor routes
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How is it built?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python for the backend and HTML, CSS, JavaScript and AngularJS for the frontend
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What were the challenges faced?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to lack of time, we were only able to implement the app for a small portion within NUS(the area in an around SoC)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What did you learn?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the Google Maps API, and also developed familiarity with AngularJS and Python as a back end language
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FindNUS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully we will be able to improve upon the project in the future
                </p>
