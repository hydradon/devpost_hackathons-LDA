                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a game, but then we got the education track, and when we were brainstorming thing related to education, we wanted to do something that would be fun, both for us and for the people learning from what we built. That's why we came up with the idea of a game that teaches players. Our initial thoughts were quiz-like types of games, but we decided that this trend was too common and not very fun. So instead, we decided to create a game that was overtly educational.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Someone plays the game, and while they play the game, they learn about viruses and explore what a world with a pandemic could be like.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity, C#, Piskelapp, and google searches.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of us have never used Unity or coded in C# before. Also, our initial plan was to find free art online, but we couldn't find anything relevant, so we made the art ourselves. Unity and GitHub also do not work very well together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning Unity and C#, and using that to create a reasonably complex game in a very short amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity, C#, communication, and teamwork.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pandemic
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Expanding the story out further, and adding more scientific facts. We wanted our scenes to be more biologically accurate, but because of the time constraints we couldn't do that.
