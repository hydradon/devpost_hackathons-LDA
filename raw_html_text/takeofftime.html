                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all interested in rocketry and space science, which helped us get inspired to make this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TakeoffTime is a rocket simulator that offers various modifications to a rocket, allows for the input of data values, and allows for user control in general. TakeoffTime uses a complex computational physics algorithm that takes these data values into a detailed spaceflight for the model rocket.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python (along with some tutorials), we created this simulator on two web pages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulty transferring the Python physics script into the JavaScript file. We also had difficulty with the GUI on the main animation page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a very nice looking introductory website, we had a very nice looking model rocket that could be manipulated by the user, and we are proud of the physics algorithms we used.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Computational physics for rocket launches are not easy. We learned that we should not use the JavaScript library three.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TakeOffTime
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding a better GUI on the main application page, and adding a better animation to our main page.
