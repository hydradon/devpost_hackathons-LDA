                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People hate Autonomous cars, so we created a product that would help ease that process of transitioning into an age of autonomous cars.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses Google Home Mini to control your autonomous car through voice commands instead of touch input, to increase safety and make the transition to autonomous cars easier.
