                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make an entertaining, yet bizarre way to collaborate with others by creating music.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In real time, you can only play a single note (currently taken from a C major scale), and others join you on the website. You can make music in a chaotic sense and come out with interesting rhythms and beats. You are only limited to the single note you can play. The rhythm and tempos are left up to you and your fellow collaborators.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using node.js and sockets.io to handle the sever and client side information to make it instant, and p5.js to create the notes and (in progress) visual effects. Images of the bottle caps/buttons were made in Adobe Illustrator from scratch as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Synchronization of all the computers connected to the website, debugging ajax commands, issues with domain name forwarding,  and visual effect implementation. We were able to overcome the synchronization problem twice, as the second time we added more components to the wave function generators. The visual effects we originally intended to use were causing too much trouble to figure out how to put them in at the moment, due to p5.js's syntax. The domain name worked previously, but appears to have stopped working. We aren't sure why, and do not have enough time to fix it.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Achieving our goal of being able to play one note on one computer, and have it play on all three of ours. As well as having multiple notes playing on all computers at the same time. We are happy to have a simplistic yet enjoyable user experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot more about node.js, and how wonderful p5.js can be for visual and audio applications.
                </p>

                    What's next for captone
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to implement multiple visual effects in addition to the one we have prepared, but not used as of yet. As well, we want to have different rooms, so that groups can be ranked by listeners. Recording and/or transcription are possibilities but may not be entirely what we want to pursue. And of course, we want to add more scales (as well as a minor mode) to provide more variety of notes/moods to explore. Finally, we want to add some kind of chat service and/or forum so that users can discuss projects in such an environment. Or listeners could give ideas or feedback to those clicking away on the bottle caps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are hoping to submit our project with the intention of applying for the best user experience and best .co domain name.
