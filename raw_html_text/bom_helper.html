                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding replacement parts is really frustrating when making PCB's.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Enter a manufacturer's part # (MPN) and it will search if the part is available from either of the 2 most common suppliers, Mouser or Digikey (these are the mass suppliers supported through common quickturn boardhouses like Tempo Automation). If it's not, the app will search through databases to find you similar parts that are available based on the specs of your part.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I started by building a python script that used REST API's provided by Octopart to search for part information. Now that I have the basic script, I am working on building out a Google Cloud App around it so it can be accessible by anyone in the world!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've never worked with REST API's or Google Cloud Platform before so this was a bit of a crazy project, but it mostly works! I had to figure out how to navigate using the Octopart API, index through all the different parts and offerings available through various suppliers and then filter for the specific suppliers and quantities desired. Then setting up the Google Cloud App was a wild ride since I have never done this before and had to skeleton out from their guestbook example.

                    I was able to implement a TON of stuff today that I've never worked with before!
