                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by androids and artificial intelligences from science fiction shows and movies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While SPIRIT cannot reply yet, it can begin to guess the basic moods of the user by their word choice.  As the user interacts more with the system, it's knowledge of which words apply to different basic moods will increase and help better determine the user's mood.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SPIRIT was coded in Python.  I had spent some time the week before beginning to code thinking about what functions would be needed to help SPIRIT find the user's mood and respond in kind.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into an issue briefly where a word was copied into the file of words relating to sadness hundreds of times, causing the program not to work.  Once that file was replaced and the code that had caused that error initially was fixed, it was only a matter of fixing a few syntax errors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of the fact that SPIRIT can find the percentage of words that relate to a certain mood and copy the appropriate words into a separate file, where it can access them the next time it starts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how the best ways to troubleshoot are when encountering errors in your code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SPIRIT
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I plan to continue with my goal to make SPIRIT understand which words belong in different parts of a sentence and be able to respond with the same mood as that of the user.
                </p>

                    NOTE: For "Try it Out section", when the link is pressed, it will bring you to a file tree.  SPIRIT is inside the chatbot folder, near the top.
