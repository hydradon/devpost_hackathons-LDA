                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As college students, we realized we spend way too much money on Postmates and clothes while also spending even more on the tuition at USC. We're full-grown adults but we somehow have less than $3 in our bank accounts!! There are other budgeting applications out there but they're so boring and just numbers. We wanted something that was inspirational and cute! Therefore, we came up with the idea of Budget Bunny, a helpful critter that can help manage your money. We hope that this application will help us and others that have the same spending issue, and we can all save money together!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Budget Bunny is a revolutionary application that aims to better the lives of its users through better spending habits and cuteness. Users can easily visualize their disposable income and where their money should go. Using the 50/20/30 rule, Budget Bunny breaks down how much users should put into savings, spend on needs (like rent, utilities, and food), and spend on wants (like Postmates and clothes!!). By keeping track of your income and spending, users can easily budget and save money.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web application was built using Vue as the frontend framework and Firebase as the database. Utilizing HTML5 and CSS3, we style the components to be responsive. We also used Javascript to create specialized functions that calculate the budget breakdown.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest issues was time, because there was not enough of it! Therefore, we created the basic implementation of Budget Bunny and we hope to add more features in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of our teammates was not familiar with the framework Vue, but she learned it fairly quickly as the project progressed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a project and we turned it in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're tired and this takes much longer than expected... we literally spent like 3 hours just trying to fix the HTML/CSS of the login/register modal (which you probably won't even look at).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, this was a great experience and we learned a lot about programming and working with each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Budget Bunny
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to add more features and work on the current implementation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also hope to create Budget Bunny in Unity to make a mobile game, where the user can interact with the bunny. :)
