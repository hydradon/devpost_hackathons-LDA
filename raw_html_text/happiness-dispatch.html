                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone goes through difficult times, and in those moments, we all need a pick-me-up. Something that never fails to cheer us up are cute pictures of cats and dogs, so we wanted to make something that could give others a tool to encourage themselves or their loved ones on a daily basis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once the user enters their name (or their friend's name) and number, they can choose whether they want pictures of dogs or cats. Then, they will receive their daily dose of happiness through texts every 24 hours of different cute pictures of either dogs or cats.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Twilio's programmable SMS function and Flask to create a website that would record user input and send daily texts, while also using Jinja to integrate Python with HTML and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first we struggled with sending media files through SMS as opposed to sending text, but we were able to overcome this barrier and learned how to fully utilize Twilio's functions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before coming to MHacks, we had no knowledge of how to write code that can send SMS messages, little knowledge of how Github works, and very little experience with HTML. However, through teamwork, we were all able to learn more about these topics and create a product that we see a future in!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Happiness Dispatch
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to include other options for what kind of SMS messages users want to receive (i.e. memes, songs, etc.). If possible, we would like to allow users the option of texting back for different responses and request pictures through texts.
