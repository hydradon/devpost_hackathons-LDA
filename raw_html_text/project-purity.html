                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for this stems from many places. From random ideas in class to things from movies and video games. We wanted to make those things a reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Project Purity is a wrist mounted, Raspberry-pi powered computer that currently runs on a custom raspbian image to work with a 5 inch resistive touch screen. The device is fully functional and works well. It is very easy to pick up and start using.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge our team ran into was the time constraints put on us and their for, we did no have enough time to print the whole casing for the device. Supplying enough power to the whole system was also a challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we could come together to put together a prototype of a vision we have had for a while now. To solve problems as a team is an accomplishment in and of itself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that putting things like this together is both challenging and rewarding. We also learned that dividing and conquering is the most effective way of completing any project like this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Project Purity
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Project purity is far from done. It has not even left prototyping. But we have enough to get a baseline for the future which will include an actual case and better power. The final product will hopefully run on android.
