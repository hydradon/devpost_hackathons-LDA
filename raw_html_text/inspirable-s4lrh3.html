                    Although social media is a tool for friends and family to connect with one another, in some cases people take this opportunity to harass others. Increasingly victims of cyberbullying and harassment experience depression and anxiety. Our team has taken matters into our own hands to leverage the already positive memories on social media to help reverse the negative effects of cyberbullying. While social media websites are making changes to interfaces to decrease cyberbullying (the new filters on Instagram and Twitter), none have attempted to promote well-being and

                    cyberbullying. Enter, Inspirable, a healthy way for you to remember the great experiences you&rsquo;ve had and that you are loved. Inspirable takes your memories from Facebook and makes a collage for you, as well as gives you an inspirational quote. This is meant to ensure that you have at least one positive interaction with your social media feed.

                <p>
                    Inspirable looks into your Facebook data and curates a set of photos from your loved ones on Facebook. Loved ones are selected based on the amount of exchanges and the type of exchanges that a user has had with someone. We look at tagged photos and wall posts.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspirable is a Facebook web application built using HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP SDK for Facebook. User information is stored in a backend mysql database. We created an application that collects all user photos that calculates who a user is close to given the data collected (users sharing photo tags are indicative of real life relationships outside of social media).  We create a collage of a user's photos to remind them that they are loved by their friends. An inspirational quote was also generated to inspire the user to know that they are special.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that our interdisciplinary team worked over 24 hours to create this application for a good cause.

                    What's next for Inspirable

                <p>
                    We would like to use additional metrics to remind users of things that they like. We were not able to collect likes in this generation, because we could not get Facebook permissions in time to do so. But recommending music and song lyrics based on a user's likes could also improve someone's mood who is dealing with the adverse affects of cyberbullying. While we initially started working on the Facebook platform, we also are open to working with other social media platforms to mitigate online harassment.
