                <p>
                    Chill-Pill is an IOT smart pill dispenser and app.

                <p>
                    Input your prescription into the app, and it will send you notifications to take your medication. Chill-Pill will also dispense the correct type and amount of pills you need at any given moment. If you don&rsquo;t pick up the pill within a certain amount of time, it will move to a reservoir, be noted automatically, and get recycled for later use before your next scheduled refill. You can monitor your medication adherence, track when you are most likely to miss your dose, and get your refill requested automatically before you run out of pills.

                    Chill-Pill dispenser has a removable cartridge to make it easy for you to take meds at home, at work, or wherever you are!
