                    Inspiration:
There are 700 Million dyslexic children in the world and only 20% of them are aware of it. Dyslexia is a disease where the affected has problem in reading, writing, memory and attention. Dyslexia is a disease that does not have any physical manifestation but it effects the person not only academically but also has a psychological  effect. It is a disease if detected early on can be managed if not cured altogether.

                <p>
                    We are team of three, with two industrial designers and  web developer and through our app LEXY we aim at identifying and treating dyslexia in Pakistan at an early stage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have a two-step process. The first step is that the identification module of the app will be licensed to educational institutes, which upon the admission tests will also conduct the test of all the children being admitted. Through a statistical analysis, the parents will be notified whether their child has dyslexic tendency and it can be further followed up. This will also give the school insight on which students they need to give maximum attention.

                <p>
                    The second module of the app which is the remedy part of it and it will be licensed out to the Mental Health Institutes like AFIMH and PIMH. There are existing solution like tests being conducted but through our app the child will not only be interacting with something interesting but they will also be taking their treatment home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the next phase, we will be collaborating with Mental Health Institutes , NGOs, Educational Organizations and Content Generators which will allow us to further develop this app and make it more effective. We will also be looking into data management.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also aim at developing products and enhancing the interactivity to make it more effective through developing muscle memory.
