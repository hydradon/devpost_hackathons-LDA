                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the web development seminar to make this website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It generates a random number from 1-100.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it on Cloud 9 using HTML5 and JavaScript. I used images and other useful website designs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many parts of this project were new to us. We had to ask around to discover how we can make this project work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to make a website without ever coding before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HTML5 is useful for making websites.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Random Number Generator HTML5 Website
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could turn this into a game where the user tries to guess the random number.
