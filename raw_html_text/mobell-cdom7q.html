                    Yesterday our team member Katy witnessed someone become isolated and excluded. She saw how a man in a wheelchair couldn&rsquo;t open the door to the cafe she was in, and felt angered that the employees did not do anything to help him. The purpose of

                    is to allow those who suffer any mobile disability gain help through an accessible app.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a portable notification system that allows one needing assistance to click a button and get it. The nearest employee with the app will get notified that assistance is needed and can locate where the user is. The user can personalize the app to needs that are most necessary to them. Employees would be trained on how the app works, and would want to help others because their manager could view statistics regarding amount of people helped, quality of their service, and more through a web interface.

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    We built this app using the technologies Google Firebase on the backend and wrote an app for Android-based mobile devices using Android Studio.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, we ran into the first issue of not knowing how to develop a mobile application, much less the Android-specific nuances of the Java language.
Through thoughtful planning of our time, and utilizing our resources (our mentors), we were able to develop an understanding of the technologies required to complete our project.
To put this succinctly, this was a "trial by fire" for all of the developers involved in this project.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    Not particularly, no. Except maybe our ability to learn how to hack together an Android mobile app so quickly.

                    We learned a lot throughout this experience. These things include:
