                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Kirpet is a way to use the data that we can collect about your pet (activity, disease risk, etc) in order to provide a customized insurance quote for you. And reward you for keeping your pet healthy by lowering your quote!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you start a new quote for a pet, KirPet uses studies done on your pet's breed, as well as activity data from your whistle collar, in order to determine your pet's general health level and adjust the price.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    KirPet is a web app built using the Laravel PHP framework. We used the data provided by KinShip in our calculation's of a pet's health level.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since the data was in CSV format, we had to figure out a way to insert it into a database for use in the web app. The amount of data was also a challenge since it could not be inserted all at once.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The final solution was to use
                    <a href="https://sqlify.io" rel="nofollow">
                        Sqlify
                    </a>
                    to turn the csv data into JSON, then iterate through each record and insert it into the database one by one.
                </p>

                    A lot about dog activity and disease data for different breeds.
