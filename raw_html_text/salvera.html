                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired buy the desire to help mitigate the most common preventable problems that happen in the operating room. We read several articles listing out many mistakes that surgeons make while operating such as, leaving supplies in patients, operating on the wrong patients, an performing the wrong procedure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program gives doctors/surgeons the opportunity to learn best practices while in the operating room and allows them to interact with virtual models of organs that they would be operating on in a real life situation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used several technologies such as Windows Presentation Foundation (wpf) for the GUI and C# as our primary language. We also used SQL Server for the Database and tied that all to the Leap motion for recognizing hand gestures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenges we ran into were working with the Leap motion as we had to accustom ourselves to the API and found difficulties integrating the leap motion technology into our WPF application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another challenge we encountered was the fact that a number of members in our team were unfamiliar with C# and WPF which provided several programming challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to produce a working product that implemented so many different technologies we haven't used before. This was mostly everyone first hackathon so being able to manage to come up with a working program within the time limit was very rewarding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Knowledge wise we learned to use many new technologies such as wpf and leap motion and use them together in a program. Team wise we improved our teamwork skills and splitting the workload to have better work efficiency.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Salvera
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have many plans with Salvera such as implementing more simulation capabilities to train future surgeons. We also have plans to implement with some type of virtual reality technology because it has great integration with the leap motion for better interactions.
