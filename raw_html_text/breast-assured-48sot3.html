                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this projected stemmed from the fact that many women are unexpectedly diagnosed with breast cancer, and we wanted to develop a way for women to get free and easy access to local medical resources that pre screen for breast cancer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website connects our users to local, medical resources and it provides users with a personalized course of action once their results have been uploaded to their page on our website and compare results to ranges of healthy breast tissue, from normal to heavy risk. In addition, our website calls on Google Calendar's API's to give users the ability to create appointments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this website using Glitch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since this is our first hackathon, we ran into several challenges.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to bring together our idea into a website that also calls on an API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about HTML, CSS, and API calling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Breast Assured
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would further develop this idea by cleaning up the website, the functionality of calling the API, and extending it with further resources. This hackathon only address the software component to our idea...we would also have to work on the hardware.
