                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the brain sensing headband to control the movement of robot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This controls the movement of robot from the electric signals generated with muse headband.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We assembled the robot from scratch, used the data from the muse headband to get the brain's electric signal, and finally used Android Studio to create a app in order to properly handle the movement of different motors inside the robot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It took almost 4 hours to make the robot running, and finally realized the Edison was faulty. Also, it was hard to translate the date retrieved from muse for the movement of robot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team managed to get the front rotation of all motors of the robot over the wireless network.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To translate the data from muse headband to control robot.

                    What's next for Limited movement vehicle control
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team is trying to reach the position where the robots movement will synchronize with head's movement.
