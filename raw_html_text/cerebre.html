                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of us got inspired to make this app after completing a "Wheel of Life" questionnaire at a workshop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cerebre tracks student's moods and activities everyday and extracts patterns to make recommendations in order to improve students moods.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As an Android app using Android Developer Studio
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had never made an Android app before, so everything was a challenge to some degree. Using external libraries and understanding documentation were the hardest part.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Albeit unfinished, we have a semi-complete product to show. Not having made an app ever before, this is quite an accomplishment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If you're persistent enough you'll get there.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A complete rewrite.
