                    Millions of people die every due to diseases they were unaware of even having. We wanted to solve this problem so we created Derm. Derm is an artificially intelligent app that uses machine learning to diagnose skin diseases. In order to use it, you have to upload an image of your skin and it will analyze the image and alert you of any possible diseases you might have. We coded our app in java and trained the Watson Visual Recognition API to be able to diagnose the diseases. Due to the limited amount of time we were given, we were only able to make our app work for a few diseases. We are very proud that we created an app that would benefit and hopefully save the lives of numerous people. It was our first time coding an app that utilized image recognition and we were able to learn a lot about how it works. In the future we would like to make Derm workable for all diseases not only external, but also internal.
