                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a Production Engineer its always a challenge to automate application stack bootsrapping from scratch which involves provisioning of the server, dns entry updates, Cluster/loadbalancer udpates, app setup per Env etc. We're trying to solve this with a complete automation in place using opensource technologies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we provision a server, we configure it to run a post install with some necessary params which is required in further steps of making this server fit for production.   In brief, these are the steps
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Post install triggers after server boot and register its details in Zookeeper.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Monitor Daemon scans the zookeeper data tree and upon finding new node entries,  Initiates an app installation setup. We provide salt formulas for each of the app stack deployment. A salt client runs on master less mode on the server to bring up the app stack.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once app installation successfull, monitor deamon moves new node entry active node tree, with attributes for deployment status and monitored(nagios) status.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Monitoring Daemon ensures addition of the node to nagios.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Random failures/errors we ran into during the hack.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Handling monitoring automation part.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could achieve a good progress on complete automation with just one day. We realised that this can be made even more beautiful with improved error handling

                <p>
                    Learned more about zookeeper, salt, vagrant,

                <p>
                    *DNS entry addition automation
*Choose a better inventory management software (with apis) to store the states of servers.
