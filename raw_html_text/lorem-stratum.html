                    The inspiration for this project stems from the idea that light therapy can provide aid to those experiencing Seasonal Affective Disorder, also known as SAD. Blankets are known to provide relief and act as a comfort object for those with anxiety. Light therapy is known to have positive effects on those with SAD. With a combination of the two approaches we hope to create a product that aids those affected by the Seasonal Affective Disorder.

                    Lorem Stratum is a low to high weight blanket with an inlay of lights. The weight of the blanket helps with comfort and anxiety while the lights provide stimulation to the hypothalamus. This part of the brain controls sleep, mood, and appetite.  The premise of light therapy is to increase the effectiveness of anti-depressants; as well as avoid them in cases where the person cannot take them (i.e. pregnant or nursing).

                    This product was built using  a Stoll Multi-Gauge Knitting machine, Arduino Feather, Appery, and El Wire light strings. We created three sample blankets to show the different weights and material that can be used. We used the Appery to create a mobile app that can change the color the blanket is displaying. The Arduino is used to power and control the string of lights.

                    Challenges that we encounter were issues programming the Knitting machine, programming the Arduino and the knitting samples breaking mid-creation.

                    We are proud of  our team for giving their all to this project. While it is not finished for us to come together and use technologies we are not familiar with I think is a great accomplishment.
