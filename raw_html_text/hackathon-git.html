                    One of our members was planning a trip to a national park, and noted the lack of central hub for information and aggregation there of. In that, we agreed it would be an excellent project to aggregate the data and help plan flights.

                <p>
                    It displays a map of all the national parks currently with a picture and description of all of them.

                <p>
                    Using a multitude of JavaScript apis we created a map, created a webpage, and worked on locating airplanes nearby.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally worked on putting the web server on python with django, ending up failing. Then we also tried using the AA mock data server which we failed to set up, and we tried using the google geocode api to locate the nearest airports, but due to formatting, we failed to make it integrate well enough, as well as failing the graphic for the flight path from your home to the park.
