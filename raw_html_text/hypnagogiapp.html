                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app is designed around the idea of Hypnagogia, which is a state between sleep and wakefulness. The method of nap that this app is designed to aid in was favored by Salvadore Dahli, Albert Einstein, and Aristotle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have all experienced the nap that lasted just a little too long which resulted in drowsiness. A hypnagogic nap is timed by your descent into sleep. Salvadore Dahli would sit in an upright position while holding onto a fork, which as he fell asleep would fall from his hand and clatter against a plate, thus waking him up.
                </p>

                    Scientists have found that there are significant benefits to naps; a short nap refreshes the mind and sharpens focus. A NASA study showed significant improvements in the performance of long flights by pilots who had had taken twenty-four minute naps.

                    The science behind it all is in the management of adenosine. As our body generates more and more adenosine, tiredness levels increase. A brief nap is useful because the majority of adenosine starts
to break down and the adrenal gland starts to produce cortisol, a chemical that helps to make you feel more alert.

                    Our app will assist late night studiers, hackers, and anyone else who needs a quick power nap in their life!

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android-Studio in conjunction with Java and xml to build our project.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is an android app, and we were unable to connect our android devices for a good portion of the testing period (emulators ftw)
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think it looks great and performs well!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    xml is complicated and android-studio is full of bugs!
                </p>

                    Maybe we'll throw it up on the Google Play for some people to enjoy!
