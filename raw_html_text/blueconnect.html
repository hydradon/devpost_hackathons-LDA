                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to help people.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It helps people connect when they don't have phone services and internet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio for the app. It uses goTenna APIs to connect to the goTenna on a drone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No Wi-Fi at the Hackathon, disappearance of team members.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought of a solution that one member of JPMC found innovative. We are able to help people connect after a horrible situation, for example natural disasters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to use existing technology to solve a major problem of people not being able to communicate without phone services and internet connection.
                </p>
