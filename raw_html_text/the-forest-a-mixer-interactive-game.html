                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever wanted to interact with people in a horror movie? Or jump scare a person playing a horror game? With Microsoft's brand new Mixer API we can allow users to interact with the live-streamer's experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game is a horror game in which the player is camping in the forest and has a dream that turns for the worse. However, the player does not know it is a dream. Your goal as the player is to escape the forest before your flashlight battery dies. If curiosity gets the better of you, you can attempt to find all of the clues about this dream before your battery dies. The player (the live-streamer) starts up the game and is given an authentication code that viewers will need to submit through Mixer.com/go to have access to the interactivity of the game. From there, the viewer will see a list of buttons mapped like a controller on their channel page on Mixer.com. These buttons will allow the viewer to spawn enemies directly behind the player to try to scare them or leave an in-game note for the live-streamer to read. There are three different types of notes and each type of note has three variations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the game using the Unity game engine. We added a plug-in for the Mixer API to create the interactivity of the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding documentation about the Mixer API was a challenge because Microsoft released it only a few months ago so we had to figure a lot of things about it on our own.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of learning a brand new API and being able to make a game that viewers can also play an active role in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us have ever used the Mixer API before so we learned a lot about how interactive live-streaming works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Forest - A Mixer Interactive Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add more content such as more ways for the viewer to interact with the live-streamers. In addition, we want to add more mechanics to the world so that there is more for the player to do and find out about this forest.
