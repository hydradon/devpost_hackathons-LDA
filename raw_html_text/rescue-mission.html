                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What inspired us was the opportunity to help find a solution that would benefit people in natural disasters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web app is a blog-style website that extracts information from the web to quickly inform the citizens of Australia about wildfires, animal attacks, or other natural disasters
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The tools, languages, and frameworks used in creating this web app was: Python, Flask, BeautifulSoup.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As expected, we ran into many challenges along the way. The main issue is an attempt at implementing a chatbot that could help make informing people more efficient. The biggest issue was finding a good fit along with our other technologies.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Honestly, just accomplishing something, even though it's really minimal was the proudest accomplishment. We are very proud of each other as a team, to come across many good ideas and manage to build upon those ideas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that there is some work to be made with managing our time more wisely to be sure to be more efficient. On top of that, we worked with some new frameworks which were interesting to learn about and read through the documentation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Rescue Mission
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next would be to implement the chatbot feature we were hoping to finish under the 24 hours. This feature would help make it more efficient for managing the website, but more importantly for the people using the web app and depending on it's efficiency to be safe.
