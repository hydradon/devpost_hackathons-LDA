                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to do something to fit the hackathon theme and prevent any wasting of time when choosing a pizza
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program takes in your diet restrictions/budget/amount of toppings you want/size pizza you want - and spits out a pizza
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used java
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I tried to use a do-while loop  I'm not sure if I used it completely correctly.
Also, I couldn't figure out how to prevent the random method from choosing a string from an array more than once
-Had problems with the curly brackets
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to use a for loop to print a certain amount of random toppings
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first time using arrays in java, and I was able to learn how to access random sections from an array and print them using a for loop
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pizza Maker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I plan to add more options for the user and also try to make my code simpler by using methods (random pizza crust etc.)
