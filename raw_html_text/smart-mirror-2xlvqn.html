                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We watched an awesome Youtube video of an MIT student's own implementation of a smart mirror and it looked awesome. It was beautifully made and included voice commands and useful widgets. This inspired us to make our own lightweight version with other features we thought would be useful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The mirror has many functions, such as show time, weather, Google Calendar, and some extras that are controlled through voice recognition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used JavaScript and HTML5 to run a webpage. Then we placed a two sided mirror over an old monitor and ran the webpage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first, we wanted to run it on a RaspberryPi but there were lots of add-ons that we had to download and would have taken a long time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The great user interactions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we had some limited knowledge of HTML, we basically all learned some HTML and a lot of JavaScript from this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Smart-Mirror
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are planning on making it larger and more "mirror-like" and touch screen in the future.
