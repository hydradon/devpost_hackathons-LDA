                    In many cases it&rsquo;s difficult to figure out if a company is collecting your information or how they&rsquo;re using it. Many don&rsquo;t provide any direct method for you to manage that access, and the ones that do are often confusing.

                        Your data is requested all the time, but who's getting it?
                    </strong>
                    By using a simple Chrome extension, we're able to identify who wants your data. We believe everyone should have full transparency on who your data is given to. With this extension, it's now possible.
