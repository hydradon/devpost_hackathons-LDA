                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the State Farm Challenge Problem. They challenged us to try and develop an alternate, efficient solution to try and recruit officials
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program asks the recruit questions that vary based on their answers and calculate a score to determine how appropriate the job applicant is to be recruited. Our program will be able to quickly decide which applicants are worth the employer's time to interview for a final check.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a decision tree as our main framework for the project. With the decision tree, we moved through it based on the user's answer and finally reached a score that later decided whether the applicant was fit for the job and could be interviewed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We encountered some issues in creating the GUI using JFrame. We had to search a lot online and try to reassess our possibilities under the time constraints.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of creating a simple application that can be easily manipulated by employees and it can effectively ask questions and respond to the prospective employee's answer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that planning is very important in order to achieve the desired solution. We understood that team-work is very important and we must work with each other's strengths.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RECRUIT_ME.nt
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will try to create a wider decision tree that can be specialized in various job fields, as we are currently just focusing on computer science jobs.
