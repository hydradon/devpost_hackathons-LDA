                <p>
                    We always wanted to easily learn new language, but we didn't had enough time. We had time to read news anyway, so why not combine the two: reading an article and learning a new language? But you do not know the other culture, so we give you a way to easily get into this culture by reading their articles!
                </p>

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on the powerful Watson by IBM, the Bing search engine, the all mighty Django hosted on the BlueMix network, we created, feature by feature, a set of tools to help one learn a new language.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some API weren't working as excepted, if at all, there was also some issues with the hosting and python3 support.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to interface Watson, Bing and Django was a thrilling experience, feeling the flow of information, the powerful backend to support us was really nice to have!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That a team experience is based on each member, that success is achievable only if everyone works together as a team, using domain specific abilities to resolve SMART objectives.
