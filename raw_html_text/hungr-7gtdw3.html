                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were hungry, and we had no time. Therefore we need an app to help us meal prep
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes into account the user's weekly schedule, budget, appliances, and dietary restrictions and recommends when and how much food to buy for that week.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We sketched wireframes to determine the look and flow of the app. We conducted some user research on mentors and cmd-f organizers, asking for their opinion on the app, and whether or not they would use it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, we used Figma to create a wireframe, turn it into a mockup, and prototyped it!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Only one person on the team knew the software and was able to teach everyone else
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a clean user interface and working mockup and prototype that is realistic!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hungr
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Actually programming and implementing it. We believe in conducting proper UX and UI before going into dev, and adopting a design thinking mindset. This way, our product is polished and has the details worked out for painless coding.
