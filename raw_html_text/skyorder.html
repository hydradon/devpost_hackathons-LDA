                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were discussing of a project idea related to the aviation industries when we found out that all of our team members have traveled in a plane before and then we started discussing about our experience. We generally had a good experience, however, the one service that we all experience issues with was the food service.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creates a better user interface for ordering food in a seamless fashion so that the customer does not have to wait for the hosts to come around to ask them if they would like any refreshments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a user interface using C#. The rest of the program was coded in Python using a python compiler.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The raspberry-pi4 was a big challenge because none of the lab equipment was up to date with the Pi 4,a nd so we had to switch to Pi 3 in order to move forward.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to learn the python language within 24 hours and managed to use it in our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned how to create a peer-to peer network, and also learned how to create user interfaces.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mile-High Meals
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on seeing how we can improve our user interfaces on the front end as well as the back end.
