                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've built quite a few Alexa skills over the last two years, but nothing that generated heavy and consistent user engagement (which make sense, as most of my Alexa skills require DIY hardware). I knew I wanted my next Alexa skill to be more user/consumer friendly. I ultimately decided to build a game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I originally planned to build a Geography challenge, where users would race around the globe to find "bad guys" by using hints/clues (facts about a city or country). I completed 80% of the framework before realizing that no child under the age of 13 would want to play my game. It was too complicated and the questions/clues were not things the average elementary school child would know.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, I stopped development for a few weeks and just observed my kids as they played games on our Alexa devices. Here's what I learned:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        My kids love simple games. A question with a clear answer makes it easy for them to get the question right
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        They like competing, but also like working together.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        They want to know how they compare to others playing the game. In addition, they like badges or clear indicators of progress
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        They like laughing at silly guesses
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        They like new and fresh content
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I took that feedback, with a few non-Alexa things that they like (puzzles, challenge games, etc) and came up with the Rebus Puzzles skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rebus Puzzles is a game where players are given three rebus* puzzles to solve each day. Players can ask for a hint or for more time as they work to solve the puzzle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Points are awarded for each correct answer. Badges are earned as players hit certain milestones.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The skill is best played on a device with a display (Amazon Echo, Amazon Spot, Fire TV, etc). Players will need to see the puzzles in order to solve them. Puzzles will be sent to the Amazon App if a user is not using a device with a display.
                </p>
                <p>
                    *Rebus puzzles are word picture puzzles that are solved by looking at the organization and arrangement of words, letters, and numbers. The puzzles typically represent a saying, word place, person, or thing.

                    I used the Alexa Skills Kits for NodeJS to start building my skills. In addition, I used AWS Lambda and DynamoDB to save session state. I also used S3 to save and serve up image content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alexa, by default, only gives 8 seconds between asking a question and waiting for a user response. I knew that my users would need more time to solve the puzzles, so I added a 10 sec timer (via an mp3 file) to give the users more time to analyze the puzzle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    [Note: This is a bit of a rant, but want to share my thoughts on the ASK CLI: In the past, I've manually uploaded the code to Lambda and added skill logic (intents, etc) via the Alexa dashboard. This time, I used the Alexa Skill Kit Command Line Interface. It saved me hours of non-development time (zipping up code, uploading code, logging into the Alexa Dashboard, navigating to the correct screen to make changes, etc). I highly recommend that anyone looking to advance to more complex skill development start using the CLI.]

                    Skills with fresh content (e.g. Jeopardy!, Flash Briefings, etc) keep users engaged and coming back, so I knew that continually adding new puzzles would be key to my skill's success. I wanted the puzzles to be new and different, so I did my best to create original puzzles. I also wanted to ensure that a player didn't receive puzzles that were too difficult, so each user gets one easy, one medium, and one "hard" puzzle each day.

                    I also needed to create categories and hints that would guide the users. Finally, I had to design a points system and award badges based on certain criteria (100 points, 3 puzzles solved in a day, 5 days of concurrent use, etc).

                    Given that, manual updates into DynamoDB wasn't going to be an option. I decided to dust of my VBA books and create a GUI that sits on top of an Excel spreadsheet. The GUI allows me to easy add information needed for the puzzle (the answer, the selected image, synonyms, etc). I have "add on" node.js scripts that:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        upload the images to S3
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        update the skill JSON file (specifically, I update the "PuzzleGuess" Intent with possible responses/answers and synonyms)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        upload the puzzle details into the DynamoDB "Puzzle" table
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        use Amazon Polly to test voice output
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>

                        Building a Self-Healing System

                <p>
                    I've spent most of my Christmas vacation working on the skill. When I resume work, I know that I'll have limited time to update the skill. Given that, I wanted to automate as much "healing" as possible, so I am in the process of writing a lambda function (to run daily) that looks to see if any puzzles are not being answered correctly. If less than 5% of users answer a puzzle, then it probably means that there is a problem with the puzzle. The function will remove the puzzle from the "available queue" until I can make changes. Likewise, if 90% of users answer a skill correctly, then the puzzle should be moved down a complexity level (e.g. from medium to easy).
                </p>
                <p>

                        Making Use of the Echo Show
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The skill is built for playing on an Echo Show (though it will work with any device through the use of display cards). I wanted to get the most out of the Echo show, so I tried to use the best Display Templates for each interaction. In addition, I allow the users to click on their badge inventory to see what they've earned and what other badges are available.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also wanted to give players the chance to learn about a particular answer (if it was relevant), so I added Alexa hint logic as well ("Ask Alexa to tell me about "The Last Jedi").

                <p>
                    Outside of what I listed above, here are a few additional challenges:
                </p>

                    <li>
                        Sometimes I had to do special formatting the words/phrases so that Alexa said them correctly.

                    <li>
                        I originally called this skill "Word Play Puzzles"; unfortunately I couldn't use the word "Play" in the invocation name. I ultimately went with "Rebus Puzzles". It's not a pretty as "Word Play Puzzles", but I'm hoping that does't work against me.

                        Designing the skill with my kids. A lot of the functionality was developed based on their direct feedback. Plus I've offered them $1 for each puzzle they create on their own (otherwise, I'll never get around to creating 90 new puzzles a month).
