                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration stems from personal experience and the frustrations of those around us. For too long patients have had their medical records in the unknown, distributed amongst various healthcare providers non-utilized for their own reference. We want to empower patients to keep their own files where they know their safe from the uncertainties of a clinic practice and which they can pull up in seconds when their on their phones or desktops.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Medicord allows patients to securely keep their files on hand and locally within a hard-drive or desktop so they can better track, manage their health, as well as always hold an up-to-date history of their records. We're limiting the use of folders and hard-copies, or supplementing a backup, and empowering patients to hold their own data for personal knowledge of their health and in case they need to directly transfer their records to alternative providers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made Medicord in Android Studio, creating a general user interface there. From there, we implemented libraries from HAPI-FHIR (a library that sends information from a database mimicking that of the real Ontario hospital patient database) to send information to our app, displaying it within. From there, we used the built in camera as well as the iText library to be able to take pictures of medical records and to export a patient's server data as a PDF respectively.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we ran into was in integrating libraries such as iText and HAPI-FHIR into the program, as well as designing the app to have a practical use in the real world
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite our difficulties in incorporating libraries, we're proud of our ability to incorporate these libraries into our Android app to create increased functionality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While developing Medicord, we learned how to access a medical database through HAPI-FHIR (and GSON), retrieve information using patient identifiers and use that information to create a PDF document with the help of the iText API. We also learned how to create an Android app that can access the built in camera within the app itself and then save images into a gallery.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Medicord
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Utilizing a library for scanning a photo for improved readability, adding a method to encrypt files, and expanding the project to incorporate more types of data from HAPI-FHIR.
