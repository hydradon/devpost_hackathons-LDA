                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I came up with the idea because of my tutor at University of Birmingham, who cannot remember faces. So I decided to build a mobile application for people with this kind of desease (Alzheimer), who cannot remember associations of faces with names.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The mobile application allows the user to develop their own face database, by being able to take a picture of a humans face, associate a name to it and save it to the database. Then they are able to recognize a face, by taking a picture of the desired person and get the name of the person returned.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I build it using Swift, Apple's lates programming language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Microsoft Face API with Swift was quite challenging, since there is no tutorial in Swift, just in Objective-C.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am happy that I have a working MVP and it can MOST OF THE TIME recognize faces correctly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a little bit about face recognition methods and how to use the Face API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DrFace
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next thing that I would do is to create my own face recognition API, because I found that the Face API is not always really accurate. And after that I would start optimizing the mobile app and add different features to it, like user browser or speech recognition for name input for images.
