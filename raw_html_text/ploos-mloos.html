                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After asking our peers about what they, fellow college students, needed most, we realized that it all came down to money, grades, and cheap tutoring. Thus, we sought out to create a hack that would combine these fields to give students the upmost opportunities in achieving success.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The student user creates a profile by choosing their university, entering their name and email, and a weakness and strength. Their weakness would be the subject they need help in the most, and their strength would be what they would tutor their matching student with. The program matches the user with a student with opposite strengths and weaknesses so that both students exchange skills without any money involved! So, it is totally college-budget friendly, it allows for new student connections, and it creates opportunities for boosting grades.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a website using HTML and backend programs with PHP and MySQL. Our relational database is stored on Amazon Web Services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During the early stages of the challenge, we had difficulty executing our ideas. We didn't know which route to pick on creating the website, as we were primarily experienced in Java but wanted to consider other options. We experienced a large learning curve, as this was our first time using HTML and PHP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned HTML and PHP in one day! In addition, we recovered quickly after changing from a Java-based website to our final plan. We also learned about the power of the Terminal and various other languages.
                    <em>
                        It's safe to say that we've been inspired to learn more skills for the future!

                    We plan on hosting Ploos Mloos on a server, and making it even more useful and accessible to students across the country!
