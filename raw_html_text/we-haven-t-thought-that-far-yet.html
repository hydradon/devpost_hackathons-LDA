                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When struggling to learn HTML, and basic web development. The tools provided by browsers like google chrome were hidden making hard to learn of its existence. As an avid gamer, we thought that it would be a great idea to create a game involving the inspect element tool provided by browsers so that more people could learn of this nifty feature, and start their own hacks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project is a series of small puzzle games that are reliant on the user to modify the webpage DOM to be able to complete. When the user reaches the objective, they are automatically redirected to the next puzzle to solve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a game engine called craftyjs to run the game as DOM elements. These elements could be deleted and an event would be triggered so that we could handle any DOM changes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Catching DOM changes from inspect element is incredibly difficult. Working with craftyjs which is in version 0.7.1 and not released therefore some built-ins e.g. collision detection, is not fully supported. Handling various events such as adding and deleting elements instead of recursively creating a ton of things recursively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EVERYTHING
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Javascript was not designed to run as a game engine with DOM elements, and modifying anything has been a struggle. We learned that canvases are black boxes and are impossible to interact with through DOM manipulation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for We haven't thought that far yet
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You give us too much credit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But we have thought that far. We would love to do more with the inspect element tool, and in the future, if we could get support from one of the major browsers, we would love to add more puzzles based on tools provided by the inspect element option.
