                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our goal when initiating this project was to help our users realize the importance of their resource consumption and take strides to lower their ecological footprint.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Project Truncus tracks the user's ecological footprint through a daily Impact Score. The user logs in every day to input their data related to their daily life and the extension tracks their progress to see if they have improved or worsened their ecological footprint. Project Truncus also adds an incentive to its users to lower their Impact Score by giving them a tree to care for daily; the higher the user's impact, the more barren the tree will look, and the lower the user's impact the healthier the tree will look.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Project Truncus was built using HTML and javascript for ease of porting into a JSON object used as a template for Chrome extensions
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The greatest challenges which arose when developing Project Truncus related to keeping the program lightweight and maintaining a clean, consistent UX. For example, in the interest of avoiding size and optimization compromise, we avoided utilizing some libraries (like jQuery) which would have made otherwise difficult tasks trivial.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No external libraries were used in the development of Project Truncus; strictly HTML and Javascript were utilized. Additionally, though this project may be simple, it strives to accomplish a meaningful goal: reducing individuals' ecological footprint.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each of us were forced to develop new and existing skills. Due to our distributed workload, all members contributed to all aspects of the project, from art assets to backend code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Truncus
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After finalizing all features of Project Truncus in its current HTML/js form, porting it for compatibility as a Chrome extension is the next step, prior to publishing the extension in the Chrome Web Store.
