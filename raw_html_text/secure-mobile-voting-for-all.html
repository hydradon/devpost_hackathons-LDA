                    Ethereum can make it easier for any organization to quickly and securely solicit votes from its members.

                    The toshi.org mobile front-end provides a simple interface to interact with the application.  Nontechnical users will appreciate the straightforward chatbot interface built using the open-source SOFA (Secure Open Financial Application) protocol.

                <h2>
                    First-Past-the-Post Voting is Bad
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most-commonly used form of most-votes-wins voting encourages strategic voting and inhibits voters from fully expressing their true preferences.  While there are much better systems available (Approval Voting, Instant Runoff voting, &amp;etc), implementing these systems and educating voters can be a substantial administrative burden.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We implement enhanced voting systems right within the app&mdash;select the system of your choice when you create a new vote.  The chatbot will walk voters through the process!

                    The app will be available soon at username
                    <code>
                        securevote
                    </code>
                    on the toshi.org mobile app!

                <p>
                    Hardware key identity support in toshi.org will make this system appropriate for votes where identity security is paramount.  Organizations can distribute hardware keys to members, enabling secure voting even if the voters' operating system has been compromised by viruses and malware.
