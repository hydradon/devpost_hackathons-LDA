                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finds university-level courses for self-studying subjects.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML and CSS to design the front end of the website. Then, we used nodejs for the backend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the college information, we used python's beautifulsoup webscrape.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because our skillset is so diverse, it was very hard to distribute work evenly among team members. Also, since not all of our members could dedicate all of our time towards this project, there were times where the work was bottlenecked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We actually managed to finish the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next time, we should spend a big chunk of our time planning out the specifics before actually tackling the work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Wild Chicken University
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on implementing a ranking system for subjects that are more popular among others, and put those in the front page so it attracts more people.
We also plan on utilizing artificial intelligence in order to automatically scrape the links for us, instead of manually adding courses.
