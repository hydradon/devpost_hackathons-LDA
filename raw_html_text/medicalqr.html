                    Inspiration

                <p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried to build android application that allows patients in hospital to scan their wristband qr code and see their scheduled examinations
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built android app using Android Studio, we used ZXinq library to capture and decode QR code and Back4ap for model database
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have never developed anything in Android Studio so we pretty much had to learn everything from the start
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It kinda works :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main goal coming here was learning and thats also why we chose a project that we did not have any experience in. It was a bit frustrating in the beginning but after we saw that our app kinda works, it was worth it.
