                    FarmeMeetsMarket was motivated by common stories bad clients who are taking advantage of economic hardship in Zimbabwe and not paying small farmers timeously. Often these end up as losses to the farmers who should be growing their business and contributing to the economic improvement.

                <p>
                    FarmerMeetsMarket improves transparency for farmers when supplying orders. The idea is to have an open and reliable market for the farmer as they can have guarantees about the availability of funds from the clients to meet the order. Liquidity is a major obstacle for many small and aspiring farmers. In our current economy, they often run into losses as they wait for payment. Blockchain's transparency will allow for reliable confirmations on the availability of funds in escrow accounts. The app brings together clients and farmers in a mutually beneficial that requires no trust due to the deposits of stakes when taking part in orders. This way, orders can be made faster as there is no need for business profile checks, referee checking etc.n
