                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I kind of just wanted to learn how to build a keyboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I randomly generates a code algorithm and applies it directly to whatever message you are trying to write. Then, it utilizes Unicode null characters to then allow for the person receiving it to decode the message, while leaving it a jumbled mess of characters for someone trying to read what was typed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I utilized the Xcode keyboard extension and programmed the project exclusively in Swift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My coding algorithm work the way I want it to, but my uncoding algorithm definitely does not work right yet... I've also hit a lot of roadblocks trying to utilize the Unicode "null" character.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've never worked with an extension before, so I'm proud that I was able to teach myself how to utilize it today. I'm also proud of the fact that I got creative and thought to use Unicode characters to help with the coding/uncoding process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unicode characters can be very difficult to work with/manipulate. Also, I really need to update my laptop.

                    I am going to get it to work tomorrow.
