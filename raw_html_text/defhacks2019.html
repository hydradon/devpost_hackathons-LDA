                    Based on the short story of the soup and the rock, in which the villagers had to work together in order to obtain their meal of the day, we have created this interface for an app that would facilitate loans from peer to peer. It utilizes a system where the user searches for the amount they need in a search bar, and get options to choose from so they can get the money they need. Furthermore, we came up with an algorithm to sum up smaller loans to add to the total amount.
