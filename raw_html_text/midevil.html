                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a game that had a classic medieval feel and look to it. We wanted to make a game that would teach us about game design and the steps to go from nothing to a playable product. The game we wanted to create would have monsters and dragons and a hero tasked with trying to slay them for survival and glory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Midevil is that game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Midevil is game that runs on a variety of different platforms where the player finds himself in a dungeon surrounded by different enemies. The player must fight to survive by shooting fireballs before he gets overtaken by the hoard of ghosts and the dragon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Midevil was build using java and the libgdx game library, which easily ports to desktop, web, and mobile platforms. We used a path-finding algorithm to navigate enemies towards the player, even around walls and other obstacles. The sprites of the game were homemade and the audio is from the public domain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into issues with memory usage growing at a high rate when playing the game with seemingly no explanation, causing the host computer to crash. This was fixed when we realized that we were, every frame, loading a font into memory when it was really needed only once. (whoops!)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the state the game is in considering that we are a two member team with neither of us having created a game like this before. Since the game started from nothing, we couldn't have imagined that it would end up in the state that it is currently. We are very excited to continue working on it in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a ton about fundamental game design while working on Midevil. Things like path-finding, collision, and design were all incredibly fun to implement and learn about during the short time that we had to work on it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Midevil
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, we have plans to add more enemy types as well as player weapons and classes for more variety. Additionally, we have plans to add different rooms and levels to the dungeon for the player to navigate. We also plan to add treasure to be collected and a scoring system so that progress can be tracked throughout the game.
