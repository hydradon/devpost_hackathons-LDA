                    Description: 
Our application serves to assist communities in disaster relief after first responders have left. The user is presented with two options upon opening the application: Help and Give. Help is intended to be a page where users can add information about an ongoing crisis from a natural disaster that first responders didn't get to. The user has the option to enter their address, enter a short description of their crisis and neighbors within a close proximity can offer to help resovle the issue through their phones native geolocation data and Google Maps. Its a tool designed to get communities back on their feet sooner with the application of creative technology. Give dislays a craigslist-esque ad page with descriptions of issues in their neighborhood and gives the user more opportunity to push neighborhood recovery a little faster through volunteering their time.
