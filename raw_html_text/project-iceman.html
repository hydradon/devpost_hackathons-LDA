                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to develop something with image recognition, so we decided to create a sports version of Shazam from Snapchat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user takes and submits a picture of a logo with their Android device and then our server deciphers what team's logo was submitted. Then, we provide the user with a variety of different statistics about the submitted team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to create an app and then used Google Cloud and Google Cloud Vision to receive and decipher the image.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into quite a tough time setting up the networking and allowing the Android device to send and retrieve images and files.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we found a way to get FTP to work with Android systems, we created our first mobile application, we were able to implement image recognition systems and try to build some of our own, and our app works with almost all Android devices, provided that they have a camera.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that networking is not at all easy, we learned how to program with Java and use Android Studio, and we learned how to utilize Google Cloud Platform for various things.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Project Iceman
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to continue to develop the app to work with a wider variety of sports, offer a wider variety of statistics about teams, and possibly even offer information about stadiums and players in the future. We also want the app to be able to offer valuable game day information for patrons at athletic events.
