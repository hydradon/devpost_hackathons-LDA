                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We go to Oakton High School, which is a school with relatively good educational quality. We learn a lot and are very busy with our homework. However, our extracurricular programs, especially after-school clubs, are always very disorganized, with many members not knowing where the next meeting is or what is going on in the club, and fun activities being organized by club leaders being dropped because of lack of participation. "Clubs" aims to solve this problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Club.io puts all the clubs together into one app by giving a social media-esque look to clubs at Oakton. It provides a login system with a profile for each user, search system for clubs, event calendars, posts/announcements, and so on. This app will have every club on its database, and all clubs are available to join at any time via the app to see what is going on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to build the Android app in Java and XML and Google's Firebase to make the login system club databases, and the chat system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to find the idea for the project at first. We had two other ideas but none of them were compatible with our software and/or hardware. This process used up around half the time we had. This resulted in very long debugging sessions at 5am over an overlooked typo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to finish an app that had a tight deadline plus many people working loudly next to us. We were able to come up with a good idea and complete it even in the face of two restarts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Club.io
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app is just for Oakton High School, but it could definitely be applied to other high schools, middle schools, or even colleges. We could add support for club positions such as president, vp, etc. as well.
