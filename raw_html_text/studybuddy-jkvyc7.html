                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students, we all take notes so we have something to study for exams, and many of us make flashcards as one way to review our notes. However, sometimes it can take a long time to type up all our notes to make flashcards out of them, which wastes study time. We thought that it would be beneficial if notes could be converted to flashcards automatically.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This site allows you to take pictures of your written notes and then scans through them to find keywords. It then uses the keywords and finds their definitions to create flashcards.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Django to build the website and the Google Vision API to convert the images to text.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble understanding how to use the API, since none of us had ever used it before. We had to work through several tutorials to try and understand it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the fact that we had something to demo, even if it wasn't perfect.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics of Django as well as how the Google Vision API works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hackuna Matata: your Study Buddy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a working prototype, but the next steps would be to expand on it and develop it further. We would like for it to be able to contain flashcards for multiple subjects and be able to categorize them by subject.
