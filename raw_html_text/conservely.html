                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Living in New York City, you tend to see a great deal of wasted resources. With stories of droughts and fires in California becoming commonplace, we decided to focus our efforts on bringing awareness to the amount of water that is wasted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website calculates the amount of water a user utilizes in a day, expressing it visually, to motivate them to be less wasteful. We strive to inspire individuals to create a positive social impact by addressing issues that affect our communities and the environment.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create an interactive website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to learn the web development languages on the fly, being that we had not created a website before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that four strangers, all from different backgrounds were able to come together and work on a common goal. Furthermore, we think that this is an innovative way to bring awareness and suggest solutions to people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics of website development.

                    What's next for Conservely
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to expand the website to cover all the ways people waste resources, such as energy and food. Also, we would like to develop products, such as a smart faucet, that tracks the amount of water utilized in a household. Furthermore, we want to create a discussion forum on our website where people can share their personal experiences and tips on how they conserve resources.
