                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a three dimensional space for organizing thoughts. VR/AR came to us as the perfect solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Place and remove asterisks in augmented space with gestures or voice!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it doesn't do
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately we weren't able to implement our original vision of creating a virtual space for annotation/ word ideation. This would be a potential next step for the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity and Visual Studio
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neither of our computers ran the required drivers for virtual reality development, so we spent a lot of time on setup and learning the technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making something that works.. sort of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The intent of this project was to learn, and we definitely accomplished that. We learned how to navigate Unity, program in C#, and much about virtual reality development/system requirements!
