                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recently the High School community across the nation have been severely impacted by the recent shootings at parkland. Hearing the stories and studying similar cases like Columbine in our classes left us wondering why their is no protocol to contact authorities quick and automatically while informing teachers and students on how to get to safety and how to be safe.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application sends an alert to authorities as soon as anyone reports a threat on school grounds. This can be done through the click of a button or even Google Assistant on practically any android phone making our product universally available. After authorities are informed of location and threat, we use image recognition in hallway cameras to see where the perpetrator is in the building. Using algorithms we concocted a way to get out of the building for students and teachers after they report their room such that they are never in the sight of the perpetrator
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We split it up into parts. One person worked on the database to store data images and maps. Another person worked on creating a map and a vector graph in order to calculate best paths using a manipulation of dijkstra's algorithm. Another person made our product compatible with both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. And Lastly one person focused on Image Recognition of guns.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not know how to use Google Assistant and designing a test building layout was also troublesome because we had to become architects such that we could prove our concept. Image Recognition was also hard because of our limited experience.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Completing the project was a tall order and we are proud that we were able to do it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about graph theory and dijkstra's algorithm. We were also able to use Dialogflow to work with Google Assistant and we learned how to use Google Cloud Platforming to host our services.
