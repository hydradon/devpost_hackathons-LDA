                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As college kids, weekly budgets and spending are very important as for most it is very limited on how much we can spend in a given week. However, it can be challenging to keep track of this spending, as with credit cards it can be hard to keep track of this sort of thing. Receipts are a great way to keep track of spending, however, they can be misplaced or lost. This is why we decided to provide a mobile solution to allowing to track spending through receipts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This mobile application will let the user take a picture of a receipt and identify the total cost spend, which it will record and account for a weekly budget based on income.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application was built using Android Studio and Mobile Vision API for text detection.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we ran into was being able to find a good way of detecting the text and ensuring that it can accurately read the prices. We had a hard time of detecting individual items on the receipt.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we have a stable version of the app working. It is able to detect parts of receipts and is able to do some basic weekly budgeting calculations for the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot as for two of our team members this was their first hackathon. It was a great learning experience to be able to go from doing simple programming projects in class to going to be able to build a complete mobile application, using APIs and different libraries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Receipt Budgeter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next steps are to make the receipt detection smarter. Right now, it can only detect total prices, however, we hope to be able to make the detection smarter and categorize the data in a more informative way.
