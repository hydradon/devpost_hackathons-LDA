                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1 in 200 people are currently homeless (or living in inadequate housing) in the UK.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Feeding and housing the homeless in an effective manner not only has huge humanitarian and ethical benefits but also has the ability to save a lot of money. This saving in turn could then be spent on addressing the root cause issues that has led to this societal problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to give people a renewed trust in donating to homeless people and therefore improving their situation we have come up with Xu: a blockhain application that allows you to donate directly, easily and impactfully.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Xu takes a scanned QR code which will be distributed to every homeless person. The donor can specify an item that he/she is donating. The shop or hostel (or any merchant) will then receive a token in order to carry out the exchange of goods, the receiver will redeem their item and lastly, the charity credits the merchant with the money in exchange for the token.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Smart contracts could be built in to the platform to ensure all transactions are completed and within certain criteria, e.g. a specific time period.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python to develop the backend using Toda Q and Luno APIs alongside OpenCV to perform QR code scanning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Proto.io was used to develop the a stunning front end visualization and UX.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried combining the front and back end by transposing our code into a Android Application however this could not be completed in time for submission.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe we've sewn the seed for creating a real, tangible impact in the world in just 24 hours.
We have demonstrated a feasible solution that could scaled up and piloted in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt a great deal about Blockchain and DLT. It is fair to say that most of our team had a prior interest in DLT but very little experience developing an application. It's been a steep but enjoyable learning curve.

                <p>
                    Who knows? Maybe we'll see a real-world implementation in the future!
