                    Inspiration --- Inspiration came from the Google challenge to use the Vision API to bring cultures together.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does --- Users are able to upload an image of a dish and Cultura will determine where the dish comes from and include a short excerpt about the culture.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it --- Cultura was built with Android studio, the Google Vision API, and the Wikipedia API
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into --- The app was originally supposed to be a react/node web app, but node was giving us issues with Google Vision API since it is still in beta, so we decided to use the more stable Android Studio version
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of --- We were able to get to train the Google Vision APi to accurately recognize food from several cultures
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned -- To leverage the several API's to get an app running and the ability to meet a deadline despite issues that may come
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cultura -- We would like to Google maps integration in order for users to get restaurant recommendations in addition to the educational culture excerps.
