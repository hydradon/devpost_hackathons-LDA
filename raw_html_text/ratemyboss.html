                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I personally had a bad experience with a manager and want to build a solution to help empower professionals with the information and connect world's professionals with great leaders.

                    Codebase is on react.

                    Challenges I ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Technical team learnt a new coding language in under 24 hours and coded a beautiful site out of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: Team is able to work together to build a functional prototype in 24 hours in a new language. Everyone met at the hackathon, built a great relationship and were all super collaborative over the 24 hours despite of sleep deprivation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What I learned: Recruit diverse skillsets into the group (software engineer, design, product, researcher, etc), have common libraries ready, have set timelines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What's next for RateMyBoss: Get beta user community, get feedback from consumers and enterprises to iterate on the product.
