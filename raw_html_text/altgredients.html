                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration comes from real life's frustrations. When cooking, we often found ourselves missing an ingredient or two, and wanted to know how to substitute them - but there was never an easily accessible way to obtain that information. So we decided to create one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app allows the users to select from a list of common ingredients. Once selected, our app provides an easy to read list of substitutions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our app natively using XCode, programmed in Swift. The accompanying website was built with Bootstrap as a foundation, and a teeny bit of javascript to polish it up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges we faced was implementing a lot of the functionality of the app. For example, we didn't originally know how to display the different options. Fortunately, we found a way!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're, first of all, proud of actually completing the app! Another aspect that we are particularly proud of is the design. We feel that it's important that our information is presented in an easy-to-read format.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned lots of iOS development - as well as many design principles along the way!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for altgredients
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to launch a few more features into the app, including a section involving recipes - though it's specific functionality is a secret for now! We also plan to add a way for users to contribute to the app, as well as add many more ingredients!
