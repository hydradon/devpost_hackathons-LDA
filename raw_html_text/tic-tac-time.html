                    Ever find yourself hitting the snooze button and waking up 30 minutes too late? This app is designed to keep individuals from succumbing to the  supposed luxury of the snooze button and simultaneously encouraging them to become intellectually ready to face the day by not allowing the app to stop ringing until after playing a tic tac toe game.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A team of three novice Mobile developers joined forces on a bus and decided to create a mobile application. With one having Android Studio already installed on her computer, the plan became creating a native Android app. This app is built with Java and xml and has multiple activities, classes, threads, and custom-made assets.

                <p>
                    1) Little to no Android development experience
2) Getting set up
3) Everything else
