                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    3D printing has a many benefits in space, but the amount of training required to model parts is too time consuming. Our goal is to create a user interface that contains a library of parts to print on command, customize, and track.

                <p>
                    printIt provides a library common parts that can be printed on command, inventories materials remaining, the states of printers, and history of use.
