                    After giveit100 released a video featuring her successful completion of a 100 day push up challenge, it was clear that Estella wasn't the only one who wanted to get more out of life.

                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In his book, The Power of Habit, Charles Duhigg presents the idea of The Habit Loop. All habits follow this cycle which contains the following 3 steps: Cue, Reward, and Routine.

                    Our hack uses combines the best elements of
                    <strong>
                        web
                    </strong>
                    ,
                    <strong>
                        android
                    </strong>
                    , and
                    <strong>
                        wearables
                    </strong>
                    to achieve sustainable motivation for good habits.

                    Add habits with ease with our web app, establish the ideal routine you want for your life. Sponsors, whether they be your parents or other users provide the reward! Who doesn't want money conveniently sent via Venmo?

                <p>
                    Unlike other web or mobile applications out there, we also have incorporated a feature of a visual reminder. With just a push of a button on the Pebble Smartwatch, you can instantly invert the colors of your watchface AND inform your sponsor of your success!

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with technology that we're not experienced with. Dissecting our idea into a manageable hack took quite a few agonizing discussions. Trying figure out how to have everything communicate within the time we have.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning so much in so little time. Gaining experience in web, android, Pebble development. Incredible collaboration between 3 people who flew from distant lands just to hack at ISU.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to create web, android, and Pebble apps. How to use Github. There was always something that we all were able to teach each other. Most of all, to never give up on an awesome idea even if you lack experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HabitHacks
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future we believe a fully fledged mobile app that combines all our web functionality would be the way to go. To show a habit feed from all users, and more!
