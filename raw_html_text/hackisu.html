                    The Problem
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've all found ourselves looking through that massive collection of photos, trying to find that one image and berating ourselves for not using a better tagging system. "I'll do it better next time, I swear!" we say to ourselves. But it never happens, and then we are sad and find ourselves crying so much that people look at us, shake their heads, and sigh at the unfairness of the universe.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    The Stand
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We, Rebecca Nelson and Josh Pohl of North Dakota State University, decided to take a stand! "Why," we said, "should humans have to do the work of sorting their images?" Pattern recognition is a uniquely difficult challenge, but we decided to embark on the quest in order to enrich the lives of the typical sentient food-consumption machines we so affectionately refer to as humans.

                    Enter ColorAnalyzer, the first step in an automatic image processing system! This bad boy crunches through pics and spits out the colors that it finds. Not only that, but it defines a range of values that colors will come out as!

                    Using The System
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All ya gotta do is make sure you got libSDL2 and libSDL2_image installed on your computational beast (but if you're on one o' them fancy-schmancy Microsoft OSs, make sure you change the link flags in the Makefile to include -lSDL2main), along with GCC, than just grab this guy from the repo,
                    <code>
                        make &amp;&amp; ./coloranalyzer &lt;path-to-image&gt;
                    </code>
                    , and badda-boom-bang! You get your list of colors! Wow!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, with this tool, we anoint you as an analyzer of the colors of man! Go out and sort some pics, yo!
