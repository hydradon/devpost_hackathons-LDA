                    From the Japanese 河 (Kawa), which translates to stream.

                <p>
                    KawAPI is a bridge between data consumers and data producers. It is a tool that allows the monetization of any data stream - whether it be industry or citizen scientists.

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe there are industries with large datasets that have non-trivial value, and no easy way to open up these datasets. We'd like to create a way to value and provide access to these datasets, with dynamic pricing based on the consumer and producer requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An example: machine learning and neural networks are solving real world problems, and they require large quality real world datasets. In general, the larger the dataset you have to train a neural network, the better the neural network will perform. The same is true of data uniqueness, which many small players can contribute to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Doctors, researchers, small business owners, even large industrial companies, all have incredibly valuable data. This data is locked behind closed doors, because they have no easy way to monetize their data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Facebook and Google have made people realize that data is gold. We're providing a tool to mine that gold and open it up to the world.

                    The Tech
                </h2>
                <p>
                    KawAPI uses IOTA to perform microtransactions for dynamically priced data streams. It consists of a client CLI that securely manages the transactions from your IOTA wallet, and a server that acts as a reverse proxy between the consumer and the producer, to securely provide access to datasets and APIs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The server is hosted at kawapi.io, but could be self hosted. Your seed never leaves your side, and all code is open-source.

                        value datasets by access bandwidth rather than selling the actual dataset

                    <li>
                        if you have a machine learning model that needs access to the dataset at a high tx rate, you'd pay more than someone who wanted a sample of the first 100 entries

                    Both our team members were unfamiliar with Go and IOTA, and had to learn these during the Hackathon! It was a great challenge, and that's what Hackathons are all about... learning.
