                <p>
                    It starts from the fact that many of us do not really know what would be the right move in case of emergencies. We want to automate the actions in such scenarios where help reaches the victim as soon as possible.

                        Sends notifications to related people once we discover you are not safe. 
Performs utmost surveillance by pointing the camera to the distress situation and predetermined people will be alerted if any panic or stress situations are discovered using the expressions, objects around and the overall environment.

                        Intel Edison takes the camera feed from an android device and sends the picture to the clarify API to look for ay negative reactions from people. 
If it finds any negative factors it will call the firebase server which will passes the messages as push notifications to android clients.
