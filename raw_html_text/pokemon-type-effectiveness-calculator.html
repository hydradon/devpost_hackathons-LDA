                    This was originally created to help me with competitive Pokemon on Pokemon Showdown, as type effectiveness can be the make-or-break factor in fainting your opponent's Pokemon. Type charts are difficult to use, and existing calculators are quite inconvenient in design, so I decided to make my own tailored toward those who need to know quickly what the best types are to use against any Pokemon (competitive games are timed, so time is of the essence). However, it can also be used by the casual gamer. It is the only program I have made as of now that I consistently use, and it is also one of the most complex, so I am quite proud of it.

                    The program works through a series of lists and databases. The input the user puts in is essentially split into separate lists depending on which effectiveness it has, and modifications are made based on these ideas: when two types are combined that have the same weakness to another type, the dual-type has a 4x weakness to this type; when two types, where another type is not very effective against both, are combined, the dual-type is affected by the other type by only &frac14; strength; when two types are combined where one type is super effective against another type and the other is not very effective against that type, these cancel out and the dual-type is neutral to that type; and, if either of two combined types are immune to another type, the dual-type is immune to that type regardless of its effectiveness on the other type. Then, the lists are compiled into another list, and that list is transcribed into the results.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is also a specific search function to target individual types and a history function to make quick comparisons easier (especially useful for doubles battles). However, it currently does not support Pokemon abilities that may affect the accuracy of the calculator. This could be a new feature in the future.
