                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was our spirit that we have for our school. We wanted to create an application that was interactive and showed others what UC Merced has to offer both comedically and entertainment wise.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BOBCOJI allows users to send stickers through iMessage and paste them on chats.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Xcode and photoshop to create images and a small program that allows users to access our application on one of the most used messenger applications in the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulty creating the correct ratios for images.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first ever application we made. We're proud because even though this was our first hackathon, we had such a great time bonding with our teammates and tackling our challenges. We feel great because this is only the beginning of our careers in application development. We also are excited for other students to be able to enjoy the use of our application in their regularly scheduled school lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the beginnings of Xcode, photoshop, and photo ratios. We never actually had the opportunity to use any of these applications and now that we have, we know that we can be capable of so much more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bobcoji
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on making better stickers, new stickers, a new icon, and actually putting it on the store. We want this application to be free for users everywhere, as a gift from us.
