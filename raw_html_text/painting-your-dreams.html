                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired from another app, one that allows the user to log the amount of water they've been drinking that day. As a result of the amount of water they drink, they will be able to watch a plant grow. We wanted to try our hand at developing a mobile application that uses positive reinforcement to do something similar.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows the user to submit any personal goals they have accomplished and see colors on another screen change as they progress.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create an iOS app, so we began by using XCode. However, neither of us knew Swift beforehand, so we built the logic using Javascript. Afterwords, mentors then helped us translate Javascript into Swift and, through various obstacles, we finished our app.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As neither of us knew Swift beforehand, we had a lot of trouble completing this app. The language was difficult to adjust to and XCode was hard to adjust to. Thus, we had a lot of troubles regarding this app, most of which we received helps from mentors in order to accomplish. For example, we originally wanted this application to show shapes that progressively gained sides instead of differing colors, but we found that creating shapes in swift was especially difficult. As a result, we changed the display from shapes to what it currently is now: changing colors.

                    We finished this app in time!

                    We learned Swift!

                <p>
                    Even though our original plan was to make it so that this app was more aesthetic, due to obstacles presented by trying to adjust to Swift, this goal was not fully accomplished. In the future, we want to try to make the app both prettier and more functional for the user. We would also like it if we could implement the original idea and have shapes that change in our main screen. Furthermore it would be ideal if we could animate this and optimize for other iOS platforms.
