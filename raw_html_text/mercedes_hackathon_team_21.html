                </h2>
                <p>
                    Whenever you want to use the map on your phone/tablet during driving, it's distracting to look for buttons on the touchscreen, or have your hands block your view. It would be ideal if these tasks can be carried out with a unified, streamlined, interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How It Works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provide a gesture-controlled platform that enables drivers to perform common tasks when driving, taking advantage of a virtual control interface and the interconnectivity of devices to achieve cross-device operations.
