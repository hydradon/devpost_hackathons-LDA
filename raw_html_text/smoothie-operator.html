                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to do Charades and Family Feud using the talking feature but we ran into some restrictions with using the room mic and Unity. We had to pivot our idea and came up with this new concept using really organically.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Customer comes into our shop and orders a smoothie. They say something like:
                </p>
                <p>
                    I&rsquo;d like something ___
                    <strong>
                        <em>
                            , with a touch of _
                        </em>
                    </strong>
                    __
                </p>
                <p>
                    Where the first item is a description of the smooth like healthy and the second item is a modifier to the smoothie and is usually something ridiculous like Death.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've built this organic experience in Unity.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Time, the first day was really spent learning the how to use the hardware, restrictions, and what we should do. We wanted to do Charades and Family Feud using the talking feature but we ran into some restrictions with using the room mic and Unity. We had to pivot our idea and came up with this new concept using really organically.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we were able to deploy  a working project, if we're being honest.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AR is hard and a bit more difficult with Hololens since it's next generation hardware.
