                    This bot was inspired by Alex when he showed us how to automate logging into gmail using just 10 lines of python. I wanted to try something similar so I ended up trying something similar with Facebook. After I got the bot to log into Facebook, I wanted the bot to be able to write to their wall. Then I had to decide what it would write on the wall. I imported a machine learning model from github that generates statements similar to the ones its fed during training. Due to time constraints, I was only able to train it for about 30 minutes and it could not form well made sentences. This was about 5am and I realized that a lot of people around me also couldn't form complete thoughts as well. So I decided that this is a spambot that simulates a brain of a developer who has not had a good night's worth of sleep.
