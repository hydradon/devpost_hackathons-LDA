                    It can add a personal touch to your favorite photos and can be shared on whatsapp, facebook (and other social media). It can also be used to customize e-cards and personalize greetings!

                    More-over for people who are differently able (and vision impaired), it is a great way to tell them the story behind the favorite photos. The best thing is they can hear it again and again whenever they want to and live every moment of it.

                <p>
                    It can be used for educational purposes too. For example: There are some esoteric diagrams/images that generally require a lot of detailed explaination. These are worth saving up with additional audio notes for later reference. A very handy revision utility for students.
On a similar note, parents can make quick bedtime stories or educational audio-visuals for their kids and play it on their favorite device!
                </p>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, GCP Vision API, GCP Text to Speech API, FFMPEG, Python, Flask to finish this task.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The uploaded image was sent to the GCP Cloud Vision aPI to gather various annotations from the image in text form. The text was converted to audio using the GCP cloud text-to-speech API. 
Finally, the audio and image were merged into a .mp4 video. (and a /mp3 audio). Both of these video and audio creations can be downloaded and shared.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into some obstacles with the merging to audio and image to a video on the fly. Finally I got that working thanks to ffmpeg tools.
