                    Are you unusually good with computers?  Do you forgo redwoods and pines for binary trees?  Do you feel a strong connection to Westworld?  Then you might be a cyborg!  And with this super quick quiz, you'll find out for sure.  Give it a try: if you score 7 or higher, you're probably a robot!
                    <em>
                        If you already know you're a robot and score less than 4, you might want to download a few internal updates

                    It quizzes you on computer-related topics to determine if you're a cyborg or not.

                    The webpage uses HTML/CSS for the front end and has JavaScript with jQuery powering the back end.  A complex heuristic algorithm uses your quiz score to analyze your computer science knowledge and determine if it's beyond that of mere mortals.

                    Getting the animations to work smoothly took a while, and there were issues with setting up the custom domain (

                <p>
                    I started this project at around 3am because I wanted a break from our team's main project but still wanted to code (yes, I might be a cyborg).  I was surprised at how quickly I was able to create the webpage, and it was lots of fun coming up with the quiz questions!  I'm glad I took the time to just do something goofy - it made the hackathon way more fun and re-energized me, and I got to share it with my friends.
