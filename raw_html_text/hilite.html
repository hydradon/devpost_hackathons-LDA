                <p>
                    With rapid development of technology coming our way, digitalizing our lives and our content has never been so simple.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cameras produce the videos and photography which litter our social networks; tablets gives us the degrees of freedom necessary for us to bring artistic expression onto a blank digital canvas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All of these innovative technologies arise from the combination of sensors which lets us bring information from the real world onto the Internet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yet, not one piece of technology allows us to digitalize, highlight, and analyze the plethora of text which is imminently available to us in the real world.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hilite is an extremely affordable text OCR-based scanner which allows its beholder to pick and bring text from the real world into the digital world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By simply swiping Hilite across any piece of text on a newspaper, novel, or even a box, Hilite will decipher said text into a digital representation, analyzing it to simplify a wide variety of scenarios any user would experience in their daily lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Looking to record some key points from a newspaper or textbook?
Looking to record calories or nutrient information from store-bought food products on a daily basis?
Looking to record payment information/cryptocurrency addresses from people or retail stores?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hilite has it all covered for you in a snap, and is notably accustomed and tailored to assisting with tasks related to either business, education, or personal healthcare.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hilite extensively makes use of OpenCV to normalize and stitch together webcam frames of text into a single panorama which best represents a sentence or text phrase from any real-world object.
                </p>
                <p>
                    _ Text OCR scanners which simply use high-frequency cameras rather than computer vision techniques cost &gt;USD$160 while ours works with a cheap consumer webcam and can easily go for ~USD$20! _
                </p>
                <p>
                    Accelerometer and gyroscope information, alongside inferred directional image gradient flow is used to normalize recorded image frames and stitch them together accordingly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A convolutional-recurrent neural network (C-RNN) architecture with text embeddings and information incorporated from Indico.io and Google Cloud NLP developed using TensorFlow was used to perform text-spotting &amp; OCR on the yielded stitched text image to cheaply digitalize any form of text from the real world within close reach.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The paper to be referenced for the architecture can be located here:
                    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.05483.pdf" rel="nofollow">
                        https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.05483.pdf
                    </a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The parameters for the linear layer and C-RNN model were determined through cross-validation and train-test ratio splits of 90:10 using a synthetic dataset of ~2000 samples. The C-RNN model was trained on the ICDAR2013 dataset.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Text embeddings from Indico.io are then incorporated on a simple feed-forward linear (logistic regression) layer to classify OCR'd text to relate to either business, education, or personal healthcare.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Android app. to be paired with the highlighter/pen was made using React Native &amp; Expo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Firebase Database, Authentication &amp; Storage was used for the entire infrastructure, saving and processing final OCR results alongside pre-processings necessary to make said results. As a result, notification of OCR results are realized on the app. in real-time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The actual scanner/highlighter itself was built using an Arduino 101, some buttons, a webcam and a lot of hot glue.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Stitching together and normalizing several frames of text in real-time was a large pain.
Finding a decent webcam to use, and adjusting it to the right location on our
                    <code>
                        highlighter
                    </code>
                    was difficult.
Preprocessing and training the two ML models we had, alongside verifying its generalization to necessary tasks for our project took quite a plethora of time.
