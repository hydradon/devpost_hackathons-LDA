                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Constantly finding ourselves in need of entertaining friends or family, we thought it would be wonderful if an app could do it for us. Thus the idea behind ChoosGo was born. The more we thought about it, the more we realized we can solve a fundamental issue and have a tremendous social impact through this kind of a day planning app. The more people can get out and experience the world together, the more human connection we can help foster. We believe it's especially important in this modern era of communication where we are both more connected and more isolated from one another than ever before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Three very simple steps: go the website, type in the name of a local city (any where in the world!) and ChoosGo will provide you a list of potential activities to keep you occupied from dawn to dusk. Just a few clicks of the mouse and you can experience the wonders of the world first hand!

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My team built a backend server running on Azure. Then we used a datascraper to parse through results found on Bing, displaying them on the front end webpage. Afterwards, the coordinates were sent to Here, creating the map seen at the bottom of the page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up and understand Azure took a long time. A huge hurdle also came from a couple of our teammates dropping out last minute.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up the service in its entirety, despite the setbacks of losing a couple of members on our team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So much about the general coding process, very happy I came today.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ChoosGo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're not entirely sure, but we'd like to integrate an Uber feature to move from venue to venue, and a Capital One feature to pay for the entire trip before leaving.
                </p>
