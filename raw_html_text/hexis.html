                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge that we faced as a team was aligning our vision with what we could technically accomplish during two days. We envisioned a large project that would include multiple functionalities. However, during the actual implementation of our plan, we realized our technical skills were quite limited.
For example, our team was generally inexperienced with using coding tools and frameworks like Django, HTML/CSS, and Bootstrap. However, we were able to scale down our plan to a realistic objective within a 2-day time-frame. Anything that we couldn&rsquo;t accomplish technically, we were able to create a mock-up with using screenshots of a user flow.

                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a simple web application, gathered research data that is applicable to veterans, developed a wireframe for the workflow, created a presentation and a pitch.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team, we learned that working with a group of people you have never met, you are not previewed each individuals strengths and weakness. With that, you must take the time to get to know the team so that you can set the tone. This provides a quick summary about each individuals passion, their goals, and stance about the project given. By doing so, you can then start to generate ideas and select the best one that everyone agrees on. However, along the way we encountered that the defined project can be cut short, mainly due to time constraints. When things need to be re-prioritized, it can cause confusion amongst the team. With that, it is important to due team check-ins and updates just to ensure everyone is on the same page.

                    Going forward, veteran, career, and business stakeholders will develop a library of skill translations. As engagement grows, stakeholders and software will fine-tune these skills. Eventually, AI/ML will be developed to automate translation and matchmaking between employers and veterans. Revenue streams will be developed with paid advertisements, employer-paid subscriptions, and premium career services.
