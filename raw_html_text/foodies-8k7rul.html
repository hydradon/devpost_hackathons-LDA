                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometime it is hard to decide on where you you want to eat. Arguing with your co-workers or friends can be unproductive. With foodies, it can decide for you, getting you to eat, and later resume whatever you were doing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app allows you to select a location and it will advise you a place to eat within your local proximity. It pulls information from the Zomato API to display information to the user on the next place to eat.

                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our application using React, HTML &amp; CSS. With these three tools we were able to create a beautiful layout and platform for our application. Because our application is a web application, we wanted to pull data from Zomato's API. Zomato can provide us information based on the longtitude and the latitude of the city that is provided in the searchbox. With the coordinates we can pull up nearby restaurants, pick one out at random, and provide extra information on the restaurant. The users can also retry the search to get another result.  We also utilized surge to deploy our website.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into positioning issues, especially with centering objects horizontally or vertically. In CSS, some display attributes ignore margins and padding which we didn't know how to fix.
