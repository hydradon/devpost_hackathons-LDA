                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Disabled persons have always been limited in their methods to communicate with the world. Due to the rapidly growing popularity and devleopment towards VR, we wanted to implement a method to allow mute people to communicate in VR using their "natural" language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Leap motion detects sign language gestures converting it into command line text. Implementation in reality would be to allow mute people to sign in VR and communicate with those people who don't understand sign language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Leap Motion SDK and built it using python 2.7.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of technological difficulties. The most trouble we had was the intimidating factor of trying to understand Leap Motion API in a short amount of time. This was the first time we worked with Leap Motion.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Managing to produce a minimum viable product despite having switched project ideas multiple times in 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use LeapMotion API as well as python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LeapLanguage
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add text to voice feature to allow mute people to sign in VR and having the ASL being interpreted as voice. This will have many applications such as in conference calls, mute people will be able to dynamically voice their opinions.
