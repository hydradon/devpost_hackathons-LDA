                    Challenges I ran into

                    For the first case, Co-Saving. Split the cost to all people who involved
                    <br>
                    We found 3 problems:
                    <br>
                    1, The first, When you go out with your friends, drink beer then sing karaoke, take a late meal.You don't want to share cost every time u finish an activity, you want to do it after the whole party end.
                    <br>
                    2, The 2nd is when you go out by the group, there always will be someone join late, someone needs to leave soon. While u must share cost exactly.
                    <br>
                    3, The 3rd, assume that you are the one who organizes the party. But you need to leave soon. What other should do?
                    <br>
                    Goal-Saving:
                    <br>
                    There are 2 problems we try to solve
                    <br>
                    1, Millennial is needed help to stay on the saving track.
                    <br>
                    2, Saving as a group, transparent is most important. Only recording is not solve the problem
                    <br>
