                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to make an app that allowed me to leverage augmented reality in order to affect the world around me, both in 
fun ways, but also in impactful ways.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Virtual Graffiti allows users to customize distinct surfaces with their own custom images on their mobile devices and
display them virtually, superimposed onto the chosen surface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We leveraged the ViroCore Library, built on top of Google ARCore Library in order to get the augmented reality functionality needed for the goals of the project. We then used Android Studio to handle the user interface and the logic for the program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Incorporating the libraries' functionality allowed us to accomplish a great deal, but learning how to properly implement it for our app's specific use case caused some issues. Also our app required the Android Camera, which required specific lifecycle behaviors and dealing with multiple threads.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We accomplished our main goal, which was succeeding in making the app that we set out to make when we started.
It took alot of work and caffeine, but it feels great to get the job done.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had multiple goals that we wanted to achieve by the end of the hackathon, but we had to cut some of those efforts short to meet our base goal. Judging the difficulty and length of a desired goal is one of the most important skills to have in a hackathon and in professional development. Hopefully we've all improved in that area.
                </p>
