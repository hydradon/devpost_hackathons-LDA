                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When lectures are fast, 30 seconds is too long to lose focus: being 1 minute late means you can't keep up with the whole thing. Lore makes note taking, learning and revision a whole lot easier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Live converts the lecturer's speech to text, and gives students access to both the transcript and Lore: our intelligent chatbot that answers questions based on the transcript (and requires some more development).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Amazon Lex API with a create-react-app boilerplate. Linking this to speech-to-text; plan was also to link it to a machine comprehension library, such as DeepPavlov.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had an earlier idea but then discovered we lacked the necessary hardware for it, so we had to rethink our plans completely. Actually building it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lex implementation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teamwork and the importance of coming with an idea that we have high confidence we can implement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Lore Bot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At some point, we'll probably try to link it up to DeepPavlov via Microsoft Bot, or something similar, to make the chat more exciting and a better fit for this project's mission.
