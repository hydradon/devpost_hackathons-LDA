                    Message in a Bottle song by Police
So many people around the world have problems that need an outsider's opinion, such as dealing with every day problems, answering common questions, and possibly personal problems.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is a sustainable way to communicate the old fashioned way.  The user has the option to either cast a problem into the virtual sea in a "message in a bottle" and wait for someone else around the world to respond and help them solve their problem or to give them advise.  The user also has the option to respond to a message already floating in the ocean and help others out.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first app and we used app inventor to make CYTA.

                    Being our first app, learning the software was challenging but not too difficult to pick up.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Casting bottles into the ocean is pollution and is frowned upon in society.  Therefore, virtually casting the bottles is earth friendly! Besides that, we learned how to make our first app together.
