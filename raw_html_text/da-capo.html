                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Transcription is a very tedious process, especially for those of us without perfect pitch!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Da Capo records you singing or playing an instrument and transcribes it onto sheet music!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built an Android app to record music, then we used a Fast Fourier Transform library to analyze the pitch.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wrapping our heads around Android development practices and concepts behind Fourier Transforms took a lot of research.
