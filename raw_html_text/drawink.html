                    GitHub! Programmers use version control everyday to track changes to their code. We make changes and push them to a remote server. Others make changes and we can bring them to our computers too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But why would this be useful when you are not programming? Well, there are a lot of uses. One of them is keeping files for public use like this

                    . We can also use version control to make cool tutorials like this one called

                    What DrawInk Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DrawInk takes this into account to create Version Control for drawings! Let's say you are designing a house. You would like to view previous versions of the drawing. You would like to be able to return to them and continue editing, you should definitely be able to share them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    DrawInk is Version Control for images! Let's say you are inventing your own strawberry cheesecake! You probably have an idea in mind and, as ingredients come to mind, you may want to change your original drawings. Maybe yyou decided to add a delicious layer of cookies below! When your recipe is finished, you send it to your friend. And, well, she doesn't like strawberries... So she edits the drawing to include an icredibly (better?) recipe with chocolate pieces on top. It is amazing, so she sends the files back to you so you can decide if chocolate cheesecake is actually better than the strawberry one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used native iOS development with Objective-C and the WILL INK Layer.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Chocolate definitely wins over strawberry cheesecake.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DrawInk
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating git into an iOS app was a tough challenge. I will fully integrate versioning control with git in a future version of DrawInk.
