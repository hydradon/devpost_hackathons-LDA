                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes I'm unable to see motorcyclists at night time and it is a major safety concern to me personally as I plan to ride motorcycles in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When the buttons are pressed arduino code that controls the RGB Leds strips trigger the base of the transistor and that turns on the desired color of light. Which would be red for braking and orange for the left and right turn signals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wrote arduino code. We assembled the circuit
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were unable to get the LED strips to turn off then the signal wasn't applied to the transistors we then used a random diode to fix the issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Taking all night (including sleep time) to solve the LED issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hardware is interesting when it doesn't work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LED Motorcycle Jacket
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will add a wireless transmitter to the handlebar of the motorcycle and connect to the turn signals and brake lights of  the motorcycle. We will add inductive coupling to the motorcycle suit that way it can be powered from the motorcycle without wire connection. We will increase the safety of the device by incorporating it to an existing leather or textile jacket that has CE rated armor.
