                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many college students are very bad at managing their money. We believe that is due to lack of practice and experience in handling ones own finances.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build a game that allows students to go through life and make choices which impact their finances. They will be responsible for creating their own budget and maintaining their bank account balance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python and web technologies such as html and javascript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a tough time integrating python scripts with our front end using DJANGO
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of completing this project in a weekend and and of working with a new tech stack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gained valuable experience on planning and implementing a game that has a complicated tree structure of events.

                    What's next for Adulting101
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Further integration of the back and front end is next on the horizon.
