                    We are in a world today where we are being flooded 24/7 with an infinite amount of information from an infinite of screens, devices, tweets, headlines, and status updates. However, we know that just because something is out there, doesn't mean it's factual, reliable, or unbiased. News channels are there to make money, all we hear are buzz words and common myths or rumors about politicians, scandals that spread like wildfire so that someone, somewhere can make a quick buck, and we were wondering how we could help remedy that.

                <p>
                    We wanted to put the power of information back in peoples hands, but without the corruption and gossip aspect of social media.

                    is a moderated wiki where users can submit purely factual information about different topics with a easy to navigate, jargon-free database. We want this to be a place where myths can be debunked, scandals de-scandalized and communication remain factual, not vague.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our website with Firebase and Bootstrap.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A key component of our idea is ease of use and simplicity, however at the same time we wanted to implement a interface that was pleasing to the user. Combining functionality and aesthetic was a problem throughout the building of the site, but one that we solved in different ways throughout the process. Bootstrap and Firebase were incredibly helpful tools in optimizing both the visual aspect and the actual hosting of the website and we took advantage.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    We are very proud #1, of finishing, and number two coming up with a simple and relatively unique idea that addresses a problem we all see.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that sometimes the most important thing isn't how complex a program it is that you right, but if the user will want to use it and about the importance of presentation and user interaction.

                    As much fun as we had making this website, we see a lot of opportunity for the potential to do some social good. Only 57.5% of Americans voted in 2012 and we believe a lot of this in the inaccessibility of politics to Americans outside of gossip and extremes. We'd like to make

                    </strong>
                    a tool to not only help educate people in an objective way about politics that they're interested in, but get them interested in politics in general and help them make educated, informed decisions. We might never be as exciting as Donald Trump, but we want to be the easiest thing in political education.
