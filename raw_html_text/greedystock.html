                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Flask Web app with React front-end, utilizes API calls.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't have time to implement all the additional features we wanted to build in our app, including a chi-square test for homogeneity of a normal distribution with unequal variance populations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting flask and react was really difficult, but after parsing through a bunch of obscure documentation on stack overflow, we debugged the major issues our app was facing.
                </p>

                    What we learned

                    Teamwork makes the dream work!
