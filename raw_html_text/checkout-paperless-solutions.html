                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted a solution to paperless receipts that was swift, easy, environmentally friendly and emulated effortless services like Apple Pay
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows the transaction receipt to be sent to a phone via nfc reader and stored automatically within an app with items
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a heroku server to store the uploads of json files representing the receipts themselves, then pulled the data from the server using an app built with the ionic framework using typescript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The nfc readers were very difficult to get to upload the data to the server, but eventually, we figured it out with some intensive and hair-pulling debugging
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Actually getting the nfc reader to work and finish with transfer being smoothly emulated between two phones
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Had never used typescript or the ionic framework, so we learned how to use those tools
                </p>
