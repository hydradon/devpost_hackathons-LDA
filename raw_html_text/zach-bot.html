                    Inspiration wanted to make a more accurate chat-bot by gauging the user's emotions through analyzing the user's input.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does It analyzes the user's input and responds based on how the user feels.

                    How we built it We used a Microsoft Text Analytics API with a Java GUI on the Eclipse IDE.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into We had trouble accessing the Analytics API and deciding which language to write the code in. (Python vs Java)
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of include: We are proud that in less than 24 hours, we were able to learn how to use an API and make a chat-bot that could comprehend basic human emotions relatively accurately solely through text.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned we learned that API's are very useful when creating complex codes, especially relating to computational linguistics. We were able to get a more accurate analysis with this Microsoft API.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Zach Bot In the future, we are planning to improve the graphical user interface and make it more user-friendly. Also, we will work towards making it available to a wider range of people by improving it to the point where it is able to comprehend complex human emotions solely through text. Our target audience will be mainly people who may have difficulties comprehending their emotions. We will aid them by providing data and insight into their emotions and how to control them.
