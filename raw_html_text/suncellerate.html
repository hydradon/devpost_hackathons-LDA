                    Inspiration I started a solar cooperative in 2011 which failed to take off, but new crowdfunding laws have really opened up the financial possibilities of raising billions in untapped dollars for creating new solar projects and revitalizing existing one. I never could shake the vision of more inclusive access to profits from clean power for small investors, and was very pleased that my teammates shared my vision for community based solar and fortunately see the potential in the idea.

                    What it does It's a web based platform for direct investment in local solar. The company negotiates with hosts (and suppliers) to get potential solar systems lined up, then we will use the platform to sell shares to finance it.
