                    My program is basically a proof of concept for a browser extension that takes news from unfiltered.new. The problem that was trying to be solved is to give people easier access to news thats now covered by their country. So far the individual components are working separate but I have not had them working all together. In the future I hope to make a fully functional extension that can be used by people on a daily basis.
