                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to make a homepage that I could use for myself.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It has links to different webpages that I use on a daily basis.
                </p>
                <h2>

                <p>
                    I used HTML and CSS.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes the code didn't work as I expected.
                </p>
                <h2>

                <p>
                    I accomplished my goal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use HTML and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Homepage for Web Browser
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I might improve it to include more links.
