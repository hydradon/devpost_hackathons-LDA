                    Professor Tom Levy and the archaeologists that provided this vast amount of data and models for us to work with.  Also, big shout out to Anish and Connor for motivating us, helping us, and overall being very approachable when we had any technical or spiritual questions.

                    We learned a lot about the history of copper smelting in the Middle Eastern area, as well as certain rises and falls of the empires and kingdoms of the time.
