                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dawn News published a report on Sexual Harassment in Pakistan.
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>    - The National Commission on the Status of Women found that 50 per cent of women they interviewed from the 
                        public sector had faced sexual harassment.
    - Recent rise in such abuse cases have been worrisome. Every other day some incident is reported. Not to say 
    about those going unreported.
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Our app named after Urdu word "Sahaara" meaning, reliance or a something/someone worthy of having confidence in, is a cross-platform mobile application that empowers not only women but everyone to confidently seek help and stay safe and aware from abuse and other mishaps when you go out.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    For common users:
Sahaara, a Social app that enables you to seek help and alert your guardians or nearby trusted people whenever you feel some danger or face any mishap. We use Location Tracking, Internet and SMS to alert guardians and nearby people by sending location and alert message. App also alerts you beforehand whenever you are about to enter the danger zones found through data clustering. The app's live feed also lets you share/alert people about some mishap that someone else is facing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For authorities: DATA, we continuously track data about mishaps and use a Machine Learning algorithm(kMeans) to generate clusters for heat-map visualization. Authorities and central databases can be connected to strive for a safer society.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started late due to a few unexpected happenings. Divided the work among Mobile App and Backend. 
For the Android/iOS app, we developed the application using Xamarin, C# and Firebase. The backend is built using a Python/Flask server. Android application has a simple easy-to-use UI. We use Machine Learning algorithm to provide information about danger zone through the data we collect.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, we started by building a native Android app using Java and Firebase. But a few problems occurred, including Firebase and connection issues; which affected our productivity greatly. We shifted the tech stack to Xamarin for mobile app and Python/Flask and Firebase for backend. And built the app in very short time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that We are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From the inspiration of idea after coming to event to shifting stacks and still ending up with a submission, that makes us feel proud. We had to change our tech stack 12 hours before submission due to unexpected problems. Yet still we are here, have designed the mobile app and developed the backend as well along with implementing a Machine Learning 4 hours before submission.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Collaboration and team work, managing tech stack issues under time pressure and other mishaps on run-time is what we have learned so far. Not to mention some nice interactions with people!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sahaara
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started implementing public feed and data processing backend for heatmaps and information on crime zones. Sahaara, aims to go on to complete the live feed and robust data processing pipelines to make it more safe and predictable to go out.
