                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I love making smart hardware. Most of my hardware ideas need to communicate with iPhone via the headphone jack. I am building an open-source library for headphone jack communication.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It controls three channels, L, R and Mic. L generates FSK waves for output, Mic receives FSK waves for input, and R generates sine waves for energy output, which means offering power for external accessories.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I coded in plain Swift. I cut of a pair of headphones, got the pins laid out on the breadboard, and used oscilloscopes to test the output from iPhone. And I used Arduino to test data transmission.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figure out Apple's AudioToolbox APIs to use with Swift. It's very, very old.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The interface is nice and simple. Everybody now can build an accessory with headphone jack communication.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Communication protocol, frequency-shift keying
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Infraudio
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Refining the library for easier use, simpler interface, so that developers do not need to know anything about the old AudioToolbox APIs to make a headphone jack hardware!
