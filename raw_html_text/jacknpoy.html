                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I always wanted to make a quick and simple but addicting game that helps decide things between two people. It has to be a game that anyone can win, like rock paper and scissors. So this is my solution
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a turn based game where both opposing players both online or offline selects an attack and move, then fetch both user attack and move inputs in Firebase Database, and calculate how much damage was received. Then whoever drops to 0 HP left loses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was purely programmed by Samuel Folledo using Swift for front end, and Firebase as the backend. We also took some gif files online in order to save time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Other than time restrictions and weird bugs. But I believe the main problem was Swift 5 just came out 3 days ago, and the newest update on Xcode made the IDE a little buggy. I was unable to commit my files unless I restart my laptop first.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were the Laser Tagging Champions #TeamKobe in Montclair's first ever Hackathon so we are all very happy about that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learned Firebase and architecting our Data structures better in order for a user to another user be able to communicate without other not included users observing or seeing the data. Although we learned how to send a request from one user to another, creating a fully working online game is harder than I thought.
                </p>

                    What's next for JackNPoy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It needs more time to think on how to architect and structure the front end with its persistent storage. Maintaining an online game is a little bit more challenging than sending a gameSession request
