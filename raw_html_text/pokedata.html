                    While undoubtedly the rise of artificial intelligence in the 21st century has transformed fields from medicine to science to law, autonomous systems have yet failed to penetrate many areas of scholarship. The world of Pokemon, where trainers and Pocket Monsters coexist in peaceful harmony, is one such untouched realm. In this project, I begin my journey to study the biology of these creatures not through the outdated wives' tales of Pokemon nurses and Gym Leaders, but instead through the objective results of self-driving mathematical and computational methods.

                    It is my dream, someday, the artificially intelligent Pokedex may no longer need its trainer, nor may the trainer need the Pokedex, but that they may instead journey forth together as equals in the eternal quest to catch 'em all.
