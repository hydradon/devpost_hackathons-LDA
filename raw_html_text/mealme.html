                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a home cook, I often find myself without any inspiration. I often turn to websites such as Allrecipes that have ingredient searches too but those have bad mobile interfaces
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MealMe keeps track of the ingredients present in your fridge through manual input and searches the Spoonacular API for recipes. While we haven't been able to connect that recipe data with the application, we can get the data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through Xcode, we went through and made storyboards, dealt with API data, and basically built the app wholly through that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Halfway through Saturday, we only had one team member writing code in Xcode. We learned that actually it is simpler to write it all there, and so half of the team had to scrap everything they did on their machines and start writing in Swift, something we are all first-timers in. Also, we had a teammate who really wanted to do Raspberry PI based CV, but stayed up from 10pm to 10am, tried 4 times from scratch, and still wasn't able to compile the program. He had to leave.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made something that looks well, can fetch data from the API, and can save ingredient data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that a project plan and early communication is a large factor in one's success.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MealMe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I plan on continuing the project in my free time and polishing up the UI, connecting the data with the interface.
