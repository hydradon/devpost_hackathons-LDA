                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally, the team planned on making a web-based game that is simple to play, yet very addictive. Similar to facebook messenger games or other addictive games, Space Bob gives a creative spin to a straightforward gameplay.  What mostly inspired us to build the game was the potential we saw to combine current game trends with rhythm mechanics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Space Bob is a simple, addictive, rhythm tap game. The player must avoid obstacles at a given song beat. We are currently in the process of adding new songs and different difficulty levels to the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game is built using HTML5 and pure Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of the challenges that the group ran into had to do with not being very familiar with certain aspects of javascript and therefore having to do a lot of learning on the go as we developed the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One thing that we are most proud of is the cool graphics that were personally designed by one of our team members. Another accomplishment we are proud of is that we decided to code the game in javascript even though it wasn't specifically the strongest code language of any of our group members. Because of that, we gained valuable experience in the language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team definitely learned a lot more about javascript and web-based programs. I specifically did not have any background in making graphics with javascript and therefore learned a lot from the game. We felt like Hack Western 4 provided a great opportunity for us to spend all of the dedicated time on coding and being able to work with people you wouldn't normally have the opportunity to work with!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Space Bob
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for Space Bob is to incorporate a multiplayer aspect to it by having a leaderboard/database aspect to the game where the score can be saved. Similarly, we would also like to integrate the game to be on different social media platforms like facebook messenger since we feel like this is where the game would excel most.
