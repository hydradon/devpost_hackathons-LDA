                <p>
                    FULL DISCLOSURE: in the Vimeo demo, due to intermittent issues with the Alexa simulator when doing a live demo, I already ran through the skill once and am replaying the responses, which hopefully will still give a clear idea as to the features that Seven Ate Nine has to offer!
                </p>
                <p>
                    NOTE: In case you're wondering why the invocation is "Seven Eight Nine," it's because Alexa recognizes "ate" as "eight" when being spoken to.  Ruins the joke a little, but oh well. :)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Seven Ate Nine is an Alexa skill that teaches the basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division! In addition to covering a breadth of operations, this skill also engages kids through problem variety:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Basic math problems (e.g. 1 + 1)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Word problems (so they can learn how to
                        <em>
                            apply
                        </em>
                        these operations)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We also have two different modes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Practice
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Play
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Play is just like practice except there is a time of 60 seconds to answer as many questions as possible. And to make it even more competitive, you get bonus points for
                    <em>
                        correctly
                    </em>
                    answering questions quickly. Practice, unlike play, also gives you feedback as to whether your answers were correct and what the correct answer was if you got it wrong.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike many skills which provide set levels of difficulty, Seven Ate Nine
                    <strong>
                        adapts
                    </strong>
                    to your performance to allow for continued engagement. If you're simply crushing the questions, Seven Ate Nine will keep raising the difficulty. If you're having a rough day or are struggling to get the answers right, Seven Ate Nine will lower the difficulty accordingly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please enjoy, and I hope you go check out my skill (see link above)!
