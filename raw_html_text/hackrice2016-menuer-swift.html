                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>Have you ever felt awkward and embarrassed in a foreign food restaurant, because you do not understand the menu? Menuer is designed to help people make orders in restaurants with entree names that are not familiar to them.
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Nothing would better explain the food than a top-ranked image search result of the entree name using Microsoft Bing Image Search.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> Menuer would allow users to take a photo of the menu they are trying to understand, then select the specific entree name they are looking for, and search on Microsoft Bing Image. And it would display a picture of the top-ranked result.
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    It works with all kinds of food around the world, as long as the food name is presented in Alphabetic letters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>We used swift to develop our front-end on IOS, Node.js as the back-end, using AWS hosting the service, and Microsoft Bing API for Image Search.
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> We had several cosmetic problem in building the IOS app, mainly due to a lack of familiarity with the language. Also, linking front-end and back-end had a lot of miscellaneous work to do. Also, there were a lot of configuration to be set hosting the app using AWS.
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> We were able to take photo of the menu, and instantly crop out of the relevant text, doing a huge amount of OCR preprocessing with a click of the finger. Also, our OCR is near 100% accurate, and the image search result all came back super relevant.
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
