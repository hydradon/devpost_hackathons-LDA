                    We wanted to help people to understand their social media followers better, so we created a tool to estimate how many likes a selfie posted on Instagram will get.

                    <strong>
                        How it works
                    </strong>
                    Using publicly available social media data, we created a dataset and built features off the following: picture, caption, likes, friends/followers. We ran Spacy Neural Nets to parse and extract features from the caption, and ran the picture through a CNN, combining everything into a neural net to predict number of likes.

                    We would like to train this on more data, and include different categories of pictures.
