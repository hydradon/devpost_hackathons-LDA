                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Isn't it annoying when you need to access car information, but you can't unless you're in the car?  MyCar solves this issue!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Utilizing APIs, MyCar allows you to access your car information, such as odometer, tire pressure, where you parked your car, and if your car is locked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our app through Expo and React Native.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to integrate the APIs we were trying to use for our MyCar app. Because we used Expo, we could only host SmartCar on a local server and it caused quite a few errors. Also, we were facing issues getting Google Maps API to work and to change the live location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A complete app that has tabs and lots of different functionalities!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us are completely new to Expo and React Native and none of us are experts in either. As a result, everything we have made in this hackathon is completely new to us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MyCar
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is only the beginning for MyCar. We plan to increase the number of car models that are able to use MyCar and integrate SmartCar into MyCar.
