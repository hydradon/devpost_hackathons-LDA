                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to create a privacy policy generator that actually respects your privacy. This is a different type of policy generator. It is one that respects the user and her privacy rights.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h1>
                <p>
                    It stores the privacy policies that you have reviewed in the past. The Privacy Policy Guard is a snap shot of the privacy terms you agreed to at the time of onboarding. Imagine you are a patient using a health and wellness app that tracks your physical activities and participation in sponsored forums. At the time you signed up, the privacy policy stated that your data belonged to you and would never be sold to a third party. Several years later the company is acquired and all it's data sold to an international insurance company. With Privacy Policy Guard, you will be able to present the policy and request that your data is deleted.
