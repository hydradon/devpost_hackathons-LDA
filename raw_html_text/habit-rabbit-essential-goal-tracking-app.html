                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>This app was initially directed towards addiction, meant to ease people off of alcohol or drugs. However, I decided to widen my consumer range to all people, and make it a general habit tracking app, so that people could use it as for their individual purposes.
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can customize their habits (title, date, repeat, category, color, and reminders) and add them to their Habit calendar, clearly showing them their progress and oncoming schedule.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used JTApplecalendar, integrated with a podfile to display the user's habit calendar, Eureka, a form API to facilitate the users' habit creation process, and CellSwipeKit, a table row swiping API to make completing or deleting habits easier and cleaner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had many problems, from saving an array to coreData, to getting local notifications to work. However, the biggest problem I had surfaced as I tried to submit to the App Store. It turns out that my frameworks were all messed up, and I ended up deleting all of my carthage files and podfiles and redownloading them. Even after that, I still had errors, and I still truly don't know how I fixed the problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the many errors I encountered throughout my project, I have learned that being a developer can be very unpredictable. I am proud of myself for being able to persevere and complete my app, despite the hardships I went through.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A year earlier, I took an app development course at Stanford with IDTech, and quite honestly, I learned absolutely nothing. They only developed my desire for more app development knowledge. That is why I came to Make School, and I am so glad I did. In just the first two weeks, I learned 10 times as much as I did in the IDTech course, and I now feel that with the practice of making my app Habit Rabbit, I can truly move on to make more. At first, I doubted the course's methods, thinking that I wouldn't be able to make an app on my own without instruction, but I have now learned to make use of the vast internet and use stack overflow excessively. I feel great about my time spent at Make School, and I think it has inspired my future career path.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Habit Rabbit - Essential Goal Tracking App
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If my app is very well-received, I will definitely continue and produce updates for my users. However, if it seems that not many people are interested, I will begin work on a new app idea that my sisters came up with. It's something they are very excited about and I want to come through for them.
