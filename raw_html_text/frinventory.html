                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's difficult to remember what's in your fridge when shopping. This is a problem we face everyday. This app allows for easy access to the contents of your fridge. When we don't know what's in our fridge, we can end up buying excess food. This can spoil, resulting in large wastes of money and energy. We wanted to find a solution that would keep this wasteful problem from occurring. We are hoping that we are helping the environment by helping you remember your fridge's inventory when you need it, thus reducing the amount of trips you have to make to the grocery store (and the amount of fossil fuels you burn).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have created an HTML  and PHP web page that lists what you have in your fridge. You manually increase or decrease the item quantity, and can add or delete items.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an HTML and PHP web page that interacts with a MySQL database hosted with HostGator. The html buttons allow the user to trigger PHP code that interacts with the the database. The default frinventory.com site allows users to increase and decrease the amount of each item in the database. frinventory.com/admin allows an admin to add and remove items themselves from the database (e.g. the admin could make the database track the amount of Eggs we have, in addition to Milk and Juice).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had initially planned to have a hardware component, that used a low-cost Nextion touchscreen to receive input from the user. The touchscreen would be mounted on the fridge door, and connected to the house's WiFi. Unfortunately, the touchscreen would not send messages properly to the Arduino, and we had to abandon the hardware component of our plan.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have built a working html and php website, that uses a MySQL database and can be edited to reflect fridge contents.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gained extensive knowledge about our Nextion touchscreen, and how to use it with the Arduino. We also learned about sockets in Java, and about PHP and HTML coding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Frinventory
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to add the hardware touchscreen component, improve the graphics and ease of use of the website, and add multiple user accounts for our website, so that many different people can use our service.
