                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we were new university students, we were shocked by the amount of people on campus. Everything seemed vast compared the sizes of our small high schools. We found solace and solitude in an empty lecture yet the next day, there was a pressuring amount of students ready to learn in that lecture hall. Therefore, we decided to create a program that could identify and inform us of individual lecture halls for many like-minded students such as ourselves.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        We compiled a list of all the courses that were offered at the University of Alberta
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        From the list, we extracted the useful information (course name, course number)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Created a program to create a url to the course for each course
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We used Beautiful Soup 4 to web scrape the date, time, and location for each class from each url
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Organized the information that was extracted and created an data architecture to hold the data
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Created a program and can search the data and limit with search parameters such as time and location
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        complied course list had different syntax and formatting
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        generating url from course list had many exception cases such as spaces in course name and letters in course number
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Web scrape of time, date, and location occasionally returned dates that are not current
                    </li>
                </ul>
