                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were relaxing in the auditorium, when I felt a good piano beat coming on. Then I thought shoot, I left my Steinway Model O 5'10" Grand Piano made with African Mahogany at home! I wasn't ready to let this beat die. So I did the only logical thing, try and use embedded systems integrated with the Myo armband and lots of Bluetooth speakers to let this masterpiece be born. After lots of blood, sweat and tears, thankfully not from me, we were successfully able to allow the use of 7 whole piano keys in various scales, on my laptop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows a Myo user interactively play piano on a virtual scale.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent lots of time working with the Myo API and generating sound files. At some point we finally figured out how to extrapolate any useful data from the Myo and we collaborated on the code and pushed for results.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The WiFi was horrible and we had much bigger plans that we had to scale back on. No one had any experience with the Myo or real knowledge of anything musical.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made something, albeit it close to nothing it was something.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that we should be more prepared for things to turn sour at a hackathon, we shouldn't be demoralized by lack of progress, and that we're mostly musically challenged.
                </p>

                    What's next for Myoosical
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More than 7 keys. The ability to play chords, move the scale higher and lower on the virtual piano. Hopefully better control schemes and other instruments.
