                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a part of the Association for Women in Mathematics, we wanted to do something math related. We know how annoying plugging equations into Wolfram Alpha, and thought that it would be easier for Google Home to do that for you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finds derivatives and integrals, after you tell it the information it needs. It's also supposed to send the answer to snapchat and makes a filter out of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Dialogflow, an api maker in Google Cloud Platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the program to output the answers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to code it in a language that none of us know.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    javascript in Dialogflow is a modified version of it and is very annoying and confusing to use.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Try to finish it and make it functional!
