                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The recent events in Flint, Michigan will have long lasting effects, and it left us wondering how to prevent a similar situation form happening again, to allow people to collect data and evidence and to notice trends before they become a catastrophe.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Intel Edison simulates the water filter and provides data to an Azure MSSQL Database.  Azure also contains information pulled from IMO's database, and provides both to the web page client, allowing it to visualize both trends in water quality and medical information that may be relevant.  Google Maps API is used to power this visualization.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using an Intel Edison to simulate a water faucet filter, Azure to provide database storage and queries using their Geo Spatial Data types, Google Maps API to visualize the data, and IMO to provide additional context for the information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Reconciling IMO's vast database against the needs of Azure and Google Maps API's expected formats for the data, getting that much data in to a form where we could work with it was time consuming.  Learning all the needed skills within the limited time frame and constrained by both small team size and limited hackathon experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we were able to come up with idea, one that allowed us to both learn and experiment with new technologies, and one that could serve a practical purpose in the real world.  It isn't perfect, it isn't complete, it won't be a sure-fire solution to these sorts of problems, but it's an attempt, and a pretty good one in our opinion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The difficulties that arise when dealing with large data sets, efficiently working with that information, removing unneeded information, reducing it to manageable quantities.  Integrating information from different sources.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WaterCheck
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improving the security of the database, determining a cost effective but reliable method of testing water quality and detecting anything in it.
