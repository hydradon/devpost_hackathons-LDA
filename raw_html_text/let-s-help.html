                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The surge of specialized chatbots using Deep learning including Eno are all automating customer service.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Chat with the bot with natural language to manage a host of clients in Capital One's Nessie API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a chat bot on Microsoft's Azure Bot Service that integrated LUIS and QnA Maker; A C# wrapper was built over Nessie to provide an interface for the app's backend services. A few APIs were hosted on the Google Cloud functions platform as well!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding the nuances of LUIS in understanding natural language was a challenge as well as deciding how to use the datasets given to enhance the interactivity of our chat bot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a great time learning C# and working with Azure and Google Cloud's NLP libraries!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    C#, NLP libraries in Python and Azure, Chatbot functionality
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Let's Help!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to add more ways to interact with our bot and hopefully make it indistinguishable from human customer service representatives.
