                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Checkers is a classic game, and we decided that we wanted to take it up a notch. We wanted to make it more of a challenge for most users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you run our program, you're able to participate one to one against the computer in Checkers. We have software in place that analyzes each move and the opponents following move to come up with the best move for that situation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using java, we coded several classes that interactive with our game board. We have a class for the AI that interprets a move ahead to determine the best move. We have a Piece class that has each piece as an individual object to engage with. All in all, we built a game of checkers, but linked it with an AI that examines several hypothetical.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a couple stack overflow errors when considering all the moves the kings can make. In addition, we had some trouble with the general design of the AI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of our work as a team. We're also proud of having a completed project. Also, the Easter egg we hid in the program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got to polish a lot of our current java skills. Also, we learned how to interact with GUI and put sound in a program.
                </p>
