                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As high school juniors and seniors, college campus safety is one of our main concerns for our future in university. We wanted to create a tool that helps keep college students, especially females, safe as they commute across their college campuses, day and night. We were primarily inspired by the heavily covered Brock Turner incident at Stanford in 2015.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The name, AEGIS, is based on the name of a shield that the Greek goddess, Athena, sometimes carries. We felt that this name and our logo conveys our intention of keeping our users safe during the day and during the night.

                    <strong>
                        Panic button
                    </strong>
                    Pressing and holding the panic button initiates a call to 911, which may be useful in situations where dialing 911 manually may be unsafe. In the Android Studio version, the panic button is also intended to notify nearby users of an emergency.

                    Our app includes a simple button to dial emergency services, separately from the panic button on the home screen.

                    Our app allows users to request "Buddies", or security escorts, to walk them across campus when they feel it is too dangerous or unsafe to do so alone.
                </p>

                    We built a rough prototype app using Thunkable, which implements a larger amount of our intended features, sacrificing precision and customizability.

                    We built a less developed, yet more thorough version of AEGIS using Android Studio.

                    <strong>
                        Thunkable
                    </strong>
                    When using Thunkable to create a prototype, we ran into multiple challenges. For example, initially, we began by using Thunkable X which allows people to create both Android and iOS apps on the same platform. However, we soon realized that this version of Thunkable had fewer features, so we switched to an older version of the platform, Thunkable Classic Android which had more features. However, we soon realized that this version of Thunkable was outdated and was a lot more complicated to test so we switched back and completed the prototype using Thunkable X. Additionally, for three of our group members, Pixelhacks III is the first hackathon that they are attended. For our whole group, this was our first experience with App development. We also encountered various issues while using Android Studio to create an enhanced and more customized version of our app, however, through this experience we learned a lot about App development and are excited to delve deeper!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Android Studio
                    </strong>
                    Although Android Studio comes with much more customizability than Thunkable, it also comes with many more errors and a lot more troubleshooting. We had some issues with Gradle, as not all of the implementations were up-to-date, as well as with getting the ConstraintLayout to function properly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Android Studio app's Firebase integration functions as intended; although the account creation system can be improved upon, the base functionality works flawlessly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout the journey of AEGIS development, we experimented with several entirely new technologies, as for the majority of our group, this was our very first hackathon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Thunkable
                    </strong>
                    We did not have any experience with Thunkable prior to this hackathon, so learning how to implement more complex functionalities with its drag-and-drop system was a learning experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Android Studio
                    </strong>
                    We had not had any extensive experience in Android Studio prior to this hackathon, thus, learning how to integrate Firebase, create Activities and design layouts (and the benefits of using a Constraint Layout versus a Relative Layout), and debug errors with the help of a well-versed Mentor was a valuable experience for our group.
                </p>

                    <strong>
                        Firebase and Google Maps
                    </strong>
                    We learned how to roughly integrate Firebase and Google Maps into an app in both Thunkable and Android Studio, and also had the opportunity to experiment around with the APIs to learn what these two tools were capable of in a mobile app environment. We learned about SHA-1 fingerprints as well as Google Maps API keys during the development of AEGIS.

                    We plan on integrating AEGIS with pre-existing university escort services for a more integrated and trustworthy experience, without having to call an external number buried on university webpages.

                        Comment system for incident reporting
                    </strong>
                    We plan on adding a comment system to the incident reporting system that allows users to view and comment on other users' incident reports, potentially providing additional evidence towards incidents and dispelling false incident reports.

                        .edu email filtering
                    </strong>
                    We plan on developing a method to detect whether or not the e-mail address used to sign up is a .edu email, and linking the user to both their college and other students from the same college.

                        UI Improvements
                    </strong>
                    We would like to add color scheme options under user preferences, specifically light/dark mode options, and a toggle option as to whether or not to change the theme based on sunrise/sunset times for the user's timezone.
