                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This system aims to help teachers count students who raise their hands up so that teachers don't have to spend time counting them.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is an object-detection system, which automatically counts the number of people who raise their hands up in classrooms/conferences settings. It can also count hands-up in real time using a webcam.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application uses computer vision techniques, to be more specific, the YOLO (You Only Look Once) version3 algorithm to accomplish the object detection. The system was first trained on a set of images where students raise their hands up in classes. The images were obtained by using an online-image-crawler. Then, the images were manually annotated by using &lsquo;sloth&rsquo;. The annotated images were then used to produced specific anchors that are different from the default settings. The anchors were automatically computed by using K-Means algorithm in Sklearn. The images were then trained for 6 hours.

                    What's next for YOLO-HandsupCounting

                <p>
                    Emotion detection for helping teachers better understand if students are off mind.
