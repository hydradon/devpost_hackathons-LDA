                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through our daily interactions with students with learning disabilities, we have come to learn that we are fortunate to be able to read lines of text without difficulties. This bridge between the ability for dyslexic people to read versus our own understanding of various texts have prompted to address this issue through our app, Ochre.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app is straightforward and user friendly. If a dyslexic person wants to translate a certain text, they can take a  picture of that text and run it through our app. Our software will then convert that text into OpenDyslexicFont, a font that is very easy to read for dyslexic people
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio and our knowledge of Java to build our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was extremely difficult to implement the OCR function in our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to implement the Camera function and Text Recognition function in our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned and developed both our soft and hard skills. We were able to collaborate effectively and learn about the Java programming language as a team!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ochre
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to be able to store the images and translated texts in files so that the user can reference back to the translated texts at a later time.
