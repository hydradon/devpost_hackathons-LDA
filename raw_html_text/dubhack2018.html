                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Suppose you have an inebriated friend who needs help getting home. However, you have no idea where he is and any type of communication leaves you clueless to his location. It would be great if there was simple way to send a pre-filled lyft ride request to your friend that would bring him or her to you? That is what dropBF aims to accomplish
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a Facebook messenger bot that upon having a conversation with will generate a filled Lyft request to another user. It requires only the current location and will bring the receiving user to the sending user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a custom page, bot, and webhook that we deployed to a public Heroku server. The webhook will monitor and conversations/interactions sent to the bot and ping the server for various responses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A major impediment to our development was the limiting capabilities of Facebook messenger. In order to create a one-click button to be sent to another user, we had to generate a completely filled out Lyft Request, deep-link, versus a half complete deep-link. Upon conversation with mentors from Lyft, Facebook, and Microsoft we tried to implement various hacks around the issue to no avail.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Understand and create our custom Facebook messenger bot that would respond to various messages in different manners. We were able to generate a deep-link Lyft URL that can be pasted into a browser to create the pre-filled Lyft request.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How Facebook Messenger bots work. Lyft deep-links. Server generation and server-side functions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for dropBF
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Create a workaround for the Facebook Messenger URL limitation. There's added URL data added to any URL we generate that blocks the Lyft deep-link from working properly.
