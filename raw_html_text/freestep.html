                    We responded to known concerns of the growing homeless population in California. Our natural concern was how to realistically help relax this issue by reducing the information gap between those that want to help and those that need it. The point of our app is to establish and execute a credibility system that recognizes those that both need the money to buy day-to-day necessities and rewards those that use the funds to help themselves the most. Think of a credit system for the homeless people.

                    While our product is not completely fleshed out, it's intended to have a donee rating system that is based on how the donee spends their money. Spending money on necessities raises the donees ratings, while excessive spending on questionable items reduces one's ratings. Our app is meant to mediate between the homeless that need credit and the banks that have the credit.
