                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    RescueMedKit Monitor Rescue medication is often temperature sensitive, RescueMedKit Monitor alerts when medication needs to be replaced, saving lives.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Insulin should be kept at a required temperature, and if not it will become ineffective with disastrous results. This device will alert you via text/email or phone app when your medication is exposed above a set threshold temperature.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the LoRa kit and Nucleo sensor board expansion kit provided, RescueMedKit was developed to alarm above a set temperature threshold. Also, it is useful to send an alarm when the medication container is opened, tampered with etc.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Designing a button/switch in the container that triggers the alarm when the container is opened. Getting the container switch interfaced with the board. Sending the alarm to the text/email interface. Design and program an app for various phones (android/ios).
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the switch to sense, alarm to work, send emails and text. Phone app is in the process of development.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to get the STM32 LoRa Discovery kit, Nucleous expansion board to interface with the LoRa network via the gateway and data lake. How Microshare environment&rsquo;s robot generate email alert.

                    What's next for Rescue Kit Monitor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Design phone app for android and ios environment to send alerts to various users such as parents, caretakers to alert about medication tampering, misuse and ineffectiveness of medication due to improper storage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    RescueMedKit container can have an alert alarm built-in with a wearable locator switch with the patient that can alarm when the container is away from the patient with various wireless connectivity or the new location feature with the new LoRa version (using triangulation method using multiple LoRa gateways).
                </p>
                <p>
                    RescueMedKit container also can sense the humidity in the container, which can come handy in future food/pharmaceutical container/shipment applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    RescueMedKit also can have sub-compartments for medications that can sense and alert/remind when the medication is not taken in time.
