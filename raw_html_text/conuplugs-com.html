                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students ourselves, we believe that the best way to succeed is to help each other out. Our goal was to build a website that includes every single pieces of information a student would look for in a course. Usually, you would search individually a course description, outline, rate my teachers, exams, the list goes on and on. With our website, we merged all potential resources to your advantage.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simply get in our website and start searching for a class you need to find out more information about.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build it using Concordia's new Open Data API. This enhanced our effectiveness into gathering information such as course ID &amp; course outlines.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Upon posting our website live, we ran into server problems &amp; php connection.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In our first hackathon, we were able to all share the work load equally and help each other in order to understand &amp; achieve our goal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that team work truly is valuable when it comes to code. As we all are becoming Software Engineer's, this was an experience we can look back on.
