                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the Uber and FreeLancer apps. However, both apps have shortcomings, such as failing to personalize the user's experience and refusing to provide a rating system (Uber), leading to ineffective customer service. Moreover, industrialization has lead to the mass commercialization of marketing. Via our app, we want to address both issues by building a free-to-use app that uses AI to match those seeking work to those wanting services (such as shoveling snow).
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses a modified K-Nearest Neighbor search algorithm that considers the past work experiences and interactions of the freelancers and employers to construct a rating system, which is used to match the freelancers to work that and employers who are most suitable for them. Specifically, after each interaction, it collects data through mandatory surveys given to both freelancers and employers to feed to the machine learning system.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wrote the backend in python and frontend in javascript. We used Firebase as the database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Javascript was hard as both of us didn't have any web experience, and incorporating Google Maps (for locating local opportunities) was difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We modified the KNN machine learning algorithm and constructed a rating system that considers personality, skill, and work enjoyment for the AI-based rating system.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned to how code in javascript.
