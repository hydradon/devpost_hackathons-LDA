                    An Explanation
With the influx of new wearable sensors, and health applications that are starting to flood the commercial space, the opportunity has arisen to provide a service to these competing providers. The challenges that they face are the same that any other software service provider faces in the realm of data management and analytics. These problems are further compounded by their creation of distributed hardware systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of these problems are:
Fast, multi-region data storage
Highly available data storage
Reliably streaming data in and out of their storage solutions
Real time stream analytics
Batch analytics on their data warehouse
What we can provide
Our final goal would be to build a machine learning analytics platform that can ingest any health data and output information such as diagnostics, alerts, and reports.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, this will take time and internal development. In the interim, to build up our internal capabilities, we can provide our customers with services related to the streaming, storage, and aggregation of health data.
Streaming
The ability to stream data in real time from global devices is a challenge that all of these companies would have to face. We can provide them API endpoints that they can point their hardware to, and rely on us as a data ingestion/egress system. We will provide them with a highly reliable, and distributed streaming capability to both receive and send information to their devices/services.
Storage
Storage can be a large challenge in a distributed system with a large data stream. Our API endpoints can provide our customers with a way to abstract away their storage needs and focus on the development on their hardware or actual service. We would provide them with a highly durable, replicated storage system.
Aggregation
Even without any machine learning in place, we can provide analytical capability to our customers. By giving them the ability to quickly search and query their data, we can allow them to quickly build Business Intelligence solutions to better understand their customers.
Integrations
We can also focus on the ease of integration with existing services and hardware devices, this would allow our customers to not only create a service or a device that uses their system but painlessly use other APIs and services.
Managed Services
In addition to providing these APIs to our clients, we can also offer them a managed contract whereby we partner with them to build various hardware or software solutions tailored to their needs.

                <p>
                    Some scenarios of these bespoke solutions:
                </p>
                <p>
                    A company creating wearables in the running market may want to do custom machine learning and analytics on the data that their customers generate. We may provide them with a software system that can produce the alerting and reporting that they desire, and is completely unique to their company
                </p>
                <p>
                    A company in the eldercare market may want a system that integrates into their existing EHR and monitoring systems, to provide them with analytics to better provide care for their patients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All of these solutions may not translate to the larger market, but with these service contracts, we can create lasting partnerships, that we can use to further our own capabilities, while having long term customers that help us fund our development.
Value
The value in these services lie in the effort and cost savings that a managed service provides. The customer does not have to procure, manage, develop, and staff these systems. 
First Steps
With the platform being a long term plan, we can generate both interest, and capability with the resources we have at hand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using the ECG sensor, we can demonstrate the ability to create a true end to end solution. This means that we can: create our own hardware, integrate it with our platform, and that our platform can stream, store, and analyze data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This cues customers into the fact that we can execute for them and manage these otherwise complex tasks.
We are also using the large amount of ECG based devices to court them into using our data platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other demonstration applications can be built to suit the particular customer that we are approaching.
