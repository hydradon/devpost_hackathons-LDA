                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted an informative application that would be useful to drivers of Houston, be they commuters or passer-bys.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application shows people indepth information about parking citations in the neighborhoods of Houston.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this using JavaScript and the Google Maps API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making sure that our dataset was accurate and reflected the parking citation situation as clearly as possible. Challenges included data that was not always consistent.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to accomplish every target goal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We walk away from this Hackathon as better developers with a stronger knowledge of dataset interation, as well as query modification.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Parking Citation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are lots of additional features that can be added to the project, including expanding datasets. We hope to see this project continue to develop and grow.
