                    Identifying Emerging Viral Personalities for Music Career Development
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for Radar is the emergence of viral personalities in digital culture. Often times viral personalities make the transition to entertainment due to their built in audience. Radar uses social, search, and traditional media data points to identify, nurture, and deliver qualified viral personalities to A&amp;R department at record labels. Our goal at Radar is to maximize viral opportunities using big data analytics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Radar provides a simple interface for record labels to search a live database of viral personalities. These viral personalities are graded on social engagement, traditional media support, and a music challenge provided by Radar. Personalities that rise to the top are provided a cover song to distribute through their social platforms. If engagement continues to be strong the personality is elevated to qualified status and provided to record labels.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Radar was developed in Kony using HTML, CSS, JavaScript hosted on AWS servers. We used Qloo and BuzzAngle to cross check audience potential between viral personalities and current stars.  7Digital was used to identify content for music challenges. Miro and Google Docs were used for project management. DevPost was used for project submission.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we were working heavily in Miro, everything came to a halt once the wifi crashed. Big data analytics is a high priority for record labels. Connecting to the various data sources and identifying information leading to sophisticated business decisions is not a simple task. The Radar team&rsquo;s focus is an simple interface with sophisticated data analysis enabling developers to focus energy on high ROI items. Kony very much helped us rapid prototype our front-end. Connecting to social APIs gave us a hard time at the start.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Participating in a hackathon is an accomplishment in itself! Utilizing so many APIs for the first time can give developers option paralysis. The Radar team was able to put together a clever solution that uses sponsor APIs to provide a valuable data solution for the music industry. Listening to UMG discuss their biggest pain points and coming up with a solution to address them shows that Radar is intune with the music industry&rsquo;s needs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Radar team learned to leverage the strengths of multiple APIs to solve music industry needs. We rapidly learned a new prototyping platform (Kony) and began integrating with social APIs. Qloo and BuzzAngle provide industry insights that can lead high level analysis of Viral Personalities. Integrating these technologies with a simple user interface within a hackathon is a rewarding experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Radar
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Radar was designed and created to be a real business. We fully plan to flush out our scalable architecture and take this technology to the market. A pilot program with Capital Studios or Universal Music Group would enable us to reach the next level of development. We hope to follow up with Tuhin, Amy, and Ching-Ching in the follow weeks to discuss feasibility of Radar&rsquo;s technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Pitch
                </h2>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Cash me ousside, how bout that.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Everyone remember that? The 13-year-old &lsquo;cash me outside&rsquo; viral meme Danielle Bregoli; she became a viral sensation overnight in 2016 after appearing on Dr Phil. &lsquo;Cash me outside&rsquo; memes were blasted across social media, her appearance on Dr Phil&rsquo;s Youtube amassed more than 46 million views, and she was an immediate trending internet sensation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But what happened next is where we see a major opportunity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following her viral popularity, Danielle, going by the stage name Bhad Bhabie, released her first musical single. This single peaked at number one on Spotify's Viral US and Global Charts and garnered over 5 million streams. Her song placed on Billboard&rsquo;s Hot 100 chart at number 77, and was even nominated for a Billboard Music Award for the top rap female artist category, alongside Nicki Minaj and Cardi B. Shortly after, Danielle demonstrated just how big an internet meme can become when she was signed to Atlantic Records on a multi-million dollar, multi-album deal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But, what if Universal Music Group had been able to track Danielle&rsquo;s viral evolution right as it was happening, and if they had been the first to swoop in and sign her, along with her multi-million viewer audience?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Labels like UMG focus a lot of time and money on identifying and developing artists to produce globally, commercially successful music. But what if we could give them the upper-leg? What if we could enable UMG to timely find the next multi-million viewed personality for them to develop into a global star?
                </p>
                <p>
                    At radar, we do just that. We identify trending and emerging viral personalities as soon as they appear on our radar, so that labels can develop these everyday people into their next biggest artist sensation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So what is it? Simply put, Radar provides a user-friendly interface for record labels to search a live database of trending viral personalities. These viral personalities are graded on social media hype, traditional media support, and their exponential growth over a short time period. Radar uses social, search, and traditional media data points to identify, nurture, and deliver qualified viral personalities to A&amp;R departments for record labels. Our goal at Radar is to maximize viral opportunities using big data analytics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In creating our MVP, our concept was visualised using graphic software, Photoshop and Illustrator, with these mockups then uploaded to Miro were we could further collaborate as a team. Our front-end was rapid prototyped in Kony. Using Qloo and BuzzAngle we can cross check audience potential between viral personalities and current stars. 7Digital is used to identify content for music challenges. DevPost was used for project submission.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Going forward, we want to highlight that Radar was designed and created to be a real business. The immense financial opportunity that comes with getting this right is not lost on us. We fully plan to flush out our scalable architecture and take this technology to the market. A pilot program with Capitol Studios and Universal Music Group would enable us to progress to our next level of development. We hope to follow up with Tuhin, Amy, and Ching-Ching in the follow weeks to discuss feasibility and further development of Radar&rsquo;s technology.
