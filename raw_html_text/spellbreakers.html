                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Educational typing/keyboarding games of our childhood that threw random and unrelated phrases into our delighted faces.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Engages you and one friend (soon-to-be enemy) in a heart-pounding action typing joust.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the (rarely updated, frequently deprecated) Dota 2 Workshop Tools and their scripting API, along with Lua for gameplay scripting. Also the incredible help of community documentation such as tutorials on moddota.com.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Incomplete documentation, unclear sources of truth, doubt among team members, Steam Workshop deployment
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teaching ourselves Lua and how to mod a video game over a few dozen hours. Making the game that nobody else would probably ever want to make.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To find another game to mod the next time we come up with an idea as good as this one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Spellbreakers
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Deprecation, like many of the libraries that we used to develop this faced.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Just kidding. We'd love to see the mod become more polished now that it is playable . It's surprisingly fun in a way that we'd hate to see go to waste. User experience from lobby until minute zero could use refinement, and there is lots of love left to be poured into animations and sound effects to sell the epic duel setting.
