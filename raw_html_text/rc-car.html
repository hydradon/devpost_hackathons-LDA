                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Spring Break
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It drives forward and scans the path in front of itself. It is finds an obstacle is randomly selects from available path options.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We put a model RC Car together, then modified the power inputs to the wheels to correspond to available path options.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not have to proper tools and materials to adequately mount a battery on car's body
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to finish several hours ahead of the deadline
We were able to get our "scanner" working to the point that we could demo it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to better somewhat better at open-ended hackathons
We learned additional trick for putting together mechanical projects
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RC Car
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Complete a proper build and further in the future add an IR sensor and toggle switch to allow for manual control, in case the "scanner" fails to work properly
                </p>
