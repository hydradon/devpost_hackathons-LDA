                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After working with children and the LEGO Mindstorms, one of our members realized that the students struggled with creating a mechanically stable robot on which to base their creative applications. It's hard to teach kids how if-then statements work to follow a line when their robot isn't able to drive. Our product provides students with a sturdy base for immediate programming sucess, while still leaving room for creativity. Students can add a variety of premade modules or create their own.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The cube-shaped base module has basic driving capabilities and is controlled via laptop keyboard. The sides of the cube are slotted to accomadate attachment modules.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Frame is made from laser-cut acrylic. Runs on an arduino that powers servo motors for the wheels. Arduino code written in processing.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Had a lot of trouble trying to connect to the arduino via bluetooth module, so we had to run it while tethered to a laptop
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a driveable robot controlled from a laptop keyboard!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Almost all of our group was new to working with Arduino. Explored a lot of cool hardware!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Robot Cubed
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd like to have the robot be bluetooth controlled. We also want to create premade modular attachments and have them connect to the base with contacts for easy plug-and-play.
