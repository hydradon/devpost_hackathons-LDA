                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We observed that people in society often feel charitable and want to donate to a cause but they do not have the time to conduct research and they fear being scammed as it is difficult to distinguish which charities are legitimate. My team decided to put together a webpage with links to different credible charities so people do not have to take time out of their busy schedules to research but they can read our descriptions of the charities and donate through our links.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Our webpage, Charity Network, has descriptions of different societal concerns so users can learn more about common issues is today's world and these descriptions can convince the users to visit the links of different charities and non-profits to learn more and donate.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We attended the Web Development workshop and were able to use the basic HTML we learned from it to build our project. We also researched different donation organizations for various causes such as health or education.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble using Github to share our code between each other but we were able to figure it out. Also, we had trouble finding out how to center our headers but we tried different things until we got the results we wanted.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of ourselves for learning and implementing html, a language we did not know, for our webpage because we had to face many challenges with formatting and style, but we persevered through them.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned html, a language we did to know prior to this hackathon, to build our webpage. In addition, we learned to work effectively as a team and work effectively in a short amount of time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We plan to make our webpage public so people can actually use this website and our hope is that our page will spread awareness of many concerns like hunger and lack of education and also boost donations for these charitable organizations.
