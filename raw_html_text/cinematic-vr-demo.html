                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Filmmaking has always been a passion of ours, so it's great to be able to bring it into the VR space.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a specially designed 3D-360 video camera that captures 3D photospheres, which we can then play back on any VR headset.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working within enclosed spaces, such as small rooms... but, I believe we solved that problem. Parking in Downtown SF during Giants games.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we managed to get it to work in the first place! But, also, that we are able to regularly reproduce our video technique and it always looks great.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to work on a short time budget. Online services may not yet be up to our task.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cinematic VR Demo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More demos, more videos, and more partnerships with people interested in VR! If you know of an event or project that would benefit from such VR, we can help you.
