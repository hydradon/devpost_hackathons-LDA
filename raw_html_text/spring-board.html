                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by Airbnb for the housing section of the site.  For the job section of the site, we were inspired by sites like Indeed.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Spring Board is a crowdsourced platform for providing low-cost and no-cost public housing, workforce training, and jobs. It is designed to fight homelessness and provide a helping hand to those affected by unemployment. In communities affected by disasters, we offers a way for residents to get temparary housing and get back on their feet.  This application provides powerful visualization features for locating jobs and houses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed the frontend with Zurb Foundation and the Google Maps API for visualizations.  The backend was created with mysql, express js, and node js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting data into the formats we wanted presented a very tedious challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are using a real database populated with data from hud.gov.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the Google Maps JavaScript API.
                </p>

                    What's next for Spring Board
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add training information.  The housing, training, and job information will be used together to provide users with more specialized content.
