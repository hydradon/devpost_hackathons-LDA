                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a way for lyricist to be able to non-biasly modify music by hearing something else sing to them.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, it gets some lyrics through our android app. Then, when connected to the Harman Everest Elite, you can listen and modify the tempo by bobbing your head. Then, when connected to the Harman Pulse 2, you can visualize the notes being played. This, in a whole is what our app does.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used android studio to develop since we decided it would be best as an android app. From there, we developed the app by splitting the program into 3 real areas, the text-to-song, the headset, and the pusle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One main challenge we had was inaccessibility to the Harman Android Dev who didn't show up. We were able to get through this by talking to other participants who were using the Pulse. The challenge also evolved further when the documentation had many issues and instructions ended up not being correct, and following documentation would lead to incorrect code and incorrect settings as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another challenge we had was having so many ideas, all which could lead to the end-product. But we would each push our own work without consideration towards the ideas of others. We came to an agreement on which way, but we realized how sometimes it is difficult to develop on a team.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to put images onto the Pulse. Stayed up late 2 days in a row.
