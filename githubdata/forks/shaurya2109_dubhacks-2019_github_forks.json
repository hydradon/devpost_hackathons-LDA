We are trying to bridge the gap that these people feel in the world with the help of our small contribution in the form of this application. We give our users the ability to be alerted every time they are being called, convert conversations with people to text, the ability to share and save these conversations, and even create an automated to-do list on the basis of their conversation. We implement this using Google Cloud's Speech to Text API and Firebase Storage to store the user's data.",
