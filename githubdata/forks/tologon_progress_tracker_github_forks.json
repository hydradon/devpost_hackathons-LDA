        "description": "For many students, the struggle of keeping track of all their courses, corresponding schedules, deadlines, exams and grades can be overwhelming. Although professors or teachers might use the same software / tools as their colleagues to organize their coursework, it is not often the case, and the burden of synchronizing data that's coming from all places is placed upon a student's shoulders.   Progress Tracker (PT) is a simple, yet effective tool for students to keep track of their personal school progress. The Progress Tracker displays all vital data such as grades, deadlines, schedules, exams, syllabus and more in a convenient, calendar-like way for the user (by default, the current week is displayed). This tool helps students to track their progress all in one place, as well as going directly to their current and/or past courses right from the Progress Tracker (using the deep-linking API). Progress Tracker can also suggest in which areas of classes a student can improve, leading up to higher grades and better performance.",
