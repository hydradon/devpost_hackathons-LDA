This could lead to HTTP request\n>   smuggling/splitting.\n> \n>   Please see the security advisory for more information:\n>   https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-m5ff-3wj3-8ph4\n> \n> 1.4.0 (2019-12-20)\n> ------------------\n> \n> Bugfixes\n> ~~~~~~~~\n> \n> - Waitress used to slam the door shut on HTTP pipelined requests without\n>   setting the ``Connection: close`` header as appropriate in the response. This\n>   is of course not very friendly. Waitress now explicitly sets the header when\n>   responding with an internally generated error such as 400 Bad Request or 500\n>   Internal Server Error to notify the remote client that it will be closing the\n>   connection after the response is sent.\n> \n> - Waitress no longer allows any spaces to exist between the header field-name\n>   and the colon. While waitress did not strip the space and thereby was not\n>   vulnerable to any potential header field-name confusion, it should have sent\n>   back a 400 Bad Request. See [Pylons/waitress#273](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/273)\n> \n> Security Fixes\n> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n> \n> - Waitress implemented a \"MAY\" part of the RFC7230\n>   (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.5) which states:\n> \n>       Although the line terminator for the start-line and header fields is\n>       the sequence CRLF, a recipient MAY recognize a single LF as a line\n>       terminator and ignore any preceding CR.\n> \n>   Unfortunately if a front-end server does not parse header fields with an LF\n>   the same way as it does those with a CRLF it can lead to the front-end and\n>   the back-end server parsing the same HTTP message in two different ways. This\n>   can lead to a potential for HTTP request smuggling/splitting whereby Waitress\n>   may see two requests while the front-end server only sees a single HTTP\n>   message.\n> \n>   For more information I can highly recommend the blog post by ZeddYu Lu\n></tr></table> ...

This could lead to HTTP request\n>   smuggling/splitting.\n> \n>   Please see the security advisory for more information:\n>   https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-m5ff-3wj3-8ph4\n> \n> 1.4.0 (2019-12-20)\n> ------------------\n> \n> Bugfixes\n> ~~~~~~~~\n> \n> - Waitress used to slam the door shut on HTTP pipelined requests without\n>   setting the ``Connection: close`` header as appropriate in the response. This\n>   is of course not very friendly. Waitress now explicitly sets the header when\n>   responding with an internally generated error such as 400 Bad Request or 500\n>   Internal Server Error to notify the remote client that it will be closing the\n>   connection after the response is sent.\n> \n> - Waitress no longer allows any spaces to exist between the header field-name\n>   and the colon. While waitress did not strip the space and thereby was not\n>   vulnerable to any potential header field-name confusion, it should have sent\n>   back a 400 Bad Request. See [Pylons/waitress#273](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/273)\n> \n> Security Fixes\n> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n> \n> - Waitress implemented a \"MAY\" part of the RFC7230\n>   (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.5) which states:\n> \n>       Although the line terminator for the start-line and header fields is\n>       the sequence CRLF, a recipient MAY recognize a single LF as a line\n>       terminator and ignore any preceding CR.\n> \n>   Unfortunately if a front-end server does not parse header fields with an LF\n>   the same way as it does those with a CRLF it can lead to the front-end and\n>   the back-end server parsing the same HTTP message in two different ways. This\n>   can lead to a potential for HTTP request smuggling/splitting whereby Waitress\n>   may see two requests while the front-end server only sees a single HTTP\n>   message.\n> \n>   For more information I can highly recommend the blog post by ZeddYu Lu\n></tr></table> ...

This\n>   is of course not very friendly. Waitress now explicitly sets the header when\n>   responding with an internally generated error such as 400 Bad Request or 500\n>   Internal Server Error to notify the remote client that it will be closing the\n>   connection after the response is sent.\n> \n> - Waitress no longer allows any spaces to exist between the header field-name\n>   and the colon. While waitress did not strip the space and thereby was not\n>   vulnerable to any potential header field-name confusion, it should have sent\n>   back a 400 Bad Request. See [Pylons/waitress#273](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/273)\n> \n> Security Fixes\n> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n> \n> - Waitress implemented a \"MAY\" part of the RFC7230\n>   (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.5) which states:\n> \n>       Although the line terminator for the start-line and header fields is\n>       the sequence CRLF, a recipient MAY recognize a single LF as a line\n>       terminator and ignore any preceding CR.\n> \n>   Unfortunately if a front-end server does not parse header fields with an LF\n>   the same way as it does those with a CRLF it can lead to the front-end and\n>   the back-end server parsing the same HTTP message in two different ways. This\n>   can lead to a potential for HTTP request smuggling/splitting whereby Waitress\n>   may see two requests while the front-end server only sees a single HTTP\n>   message.\n> \n>   For more information I can highly recommend the blog post by ZeddYu Lu\n>   https://blog.zeddyu.info/2019/12/08/HTTP-Smuggling-en/\n> \n> - Waitress used to treat LF the same as CRLF in ``Transfer-Encoding: chunked``\n>   requests, while the maintainer doesn't believe this could lead to a security\n>   issue, this is no longer supported and all chunks are now validated to be\n>   properly framed with CRLF as required by RFC7230.\n> \n> - Waitress now validates that the ``Transfer-Encoding`` header contains only\n>   transfer codes that it is able to decode. At the moment that includes the\n>   only valid header value being ``chunked``.\n> \n>   That means that if the following header is sent:\n> \n>   ``Transfer-Encoding: gzip, chunked``\n></tr></table> ...

This\n>   is of course not very friendly. Waitress now explicitly sets the header when\n>   responding with an internally generated error such as 400 Bad Request or 500\n>   Internal Server Error to notify the remote client that it will be closing the\n>   connection after the response is sent.\n> \n> - Waitress no longer allows any spaces to exist between the header field-name\n>   and the colon. While waitress did not strip the space and thereby was not\n>   vulnerable to any potential header field-name confusion, it should have sent\n>   back a 400 Bad Request. See [Pylons/waitress#273](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/273)\n> \n> Security Fixes\n> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n> \n> - Waitress implemented a \"MAY\" part of the RFC7230\n>   (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.5) which states:\n> \n>       Although the line terminator for the start-line and header fields is\n>       the sequence CRLF, a recipient MAY recognize a single LF as a line\n>       terminator and ignore any preceding CR.\n> \n>   Unfortunately if a front-end server does not parse header fields with an LF\n>   the same way as it does those with a CRLF it can lead to the front-end and\n>   the back-end server parsing the same HTTP message in two different ways. This\n>   can lead to a potential for HTTP request smuggling/splitting whereby Waitress\n>   may see two requests while the front-end server only sees a single HTTP\n>   message.\n> \n>   For more information I can highly recommend the blog post by ZeddYu Lu\n>   https://blog.zeddyu.info/2019/12/08/HTTP-Smuggling-en/\n> \n> - Waitress used to treat LF the same as CRLF in ``Transfer-Encoding: chunked``\n>   requests, while the maintainer doesn't believe this could lead to a security\n>   issue, this is no longer supported and all chunks are now validated to be\n>   properly framed with CRLF as required by RFC7230.\n> \n> - Waitress now validates that the ``Transfer-Encoding`` header contains only\n>   transfer codes that it is able to decode. At the moment that includes the\n>   only valid header value being ``chunked``.\n> \n>   That means that if the following header is sent:\n> \n>   ``Transfer-Encoding: gzip, chunked``\n></tr></table> ...

This could lead to HTTP request\n>   smuggling/splitting.\n> \n>   Please see the security advisory for more information:\n>   https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-m5ff-3wj3-8ph4\n> \n> 1.4.0 (2019-12-20)\n> ------------------\n> \n> Bugfixes\n> ~~~~~~~~\n> \n> - Waitress used to slam the door shut on HTTP pipelined requests without\n>   setting the ``Connection: close`` header as appropriate in the response. This\n>   is of course not very friendly. Waitress now explicitly sets the header when\n>   responding with an internally generated error such as 400 Bad Request or 500\n>   Internal Server Error to notify the remote client that it will be closing the\n>   connection after the response is sent.\n> \n> - Waitress no longer allows any spaces to exist between the header field-name\n>   and the colon. While waitress did not strip the space and thereby was not\n>   vulnerable to any potential header field-name confusion, it should have sent\n>   back a 400 Bad Request. See [Pylons/waitress#273](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/273)\n> \n> Security Fixes\n> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n> \n> - Waitress implemented a \"MAY\" part of the RFC7230\n>   (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.5) which states:\n> \n>       Although the line terminator for the start-line and header fields is\n>       the sequence CRLF, a recipient MAY recognize a single LF as a line\n>       terminator and ignore any preceding CR.\n> \n>   Unfortunately if a front-end server does not parse header fields with an LF\n>   the same way as it does those with a CRLF it can lead to the front-end and\n>   the back-end server parsing the same HTTP message in two different ways. This\n>   can lead to a potential for HTTP request smuggling/splitting whereby Waitress\n>   may see two requests while the front-end server only sees a single HTTP\n>   message.\n> \n>   For more information I can highly recommend the blog post by ZeddYu Lu\n></tr></table> ...

This\n>   is of course not very friendly. Waitress now explicitly sets the header when\n>   responding with an internally generated error such as 400 Bad Request or 500\n>   Internal Server Error to notify the remote client that it will be closing the\n>   connection after the response is sent.\n> \n> - Waitress no longer allows any spaces to exist between the header field-name\n>   and the colon. While waitress did not strip the space and thereby was not\n>   vulnerable to any potential header field-name confusion, it should have sent\n>   back a 400 Bad Request. See [Pylons/waitress#273](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/273)\n> \n> Security Fixes\n> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n> \n> - Waitress implemented a \"MAY\" part of the RFC7230\n>   (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.5) which states:\n> \n>       Although the line terminator for the start-line and header fields is\n>       the sequence CRLF, a recipient MAY recognize a single LF as a line\n>       terminator and ignore any preceding CR.\n> \n>   Unfortunately if a front-end server does not parse header fields with an LF\n>   the same way as it does those with a CRLF it can lead to the front-end and\n>   the back-end server parsing the same HTTP message in two different ways. This\n>   can lead to a potential for HTTP request smuggling/splitting whereby Waitress\n>   may see two requests while the front-end server only sees a single HTTP\n>   message.\n> \n>   For more information I can highly recommend the blog post by ZeddYu Lu\n>   https://blog.zeddyu.info/2019/12/08/HTTP-Smuggling-en/\n> \n> - Waitress used to treat LF the same as CRLF in ``Transfer-Encoding: chunked``\n>   requests, while the maintainer doesn't believe this could lead to a security\n>   issue, this is no longer supported and all chunks are now validated to be\n>   properly framed with CRLF as required by RFC7230.\n> \n> - Waitress now validates that the ``Transfer-Encoding`` header contains only\n>   transfer codes that it is able to decode. At the moment that includes the\n>   only valid header value being ``chunked``.\n> \n>   That means that if the following header is sent:\n> \n>   ``Transfer-Encoding: gzip, chunked``\n></tr></table> ...
