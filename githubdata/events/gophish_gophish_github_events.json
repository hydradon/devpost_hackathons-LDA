The completion date will also be displayed in the results page when the campaign is not completed and the date is after the launch date. \r\n\r\nI have run multiple tests using both API and Web GUI with consistent results. Multiple tests have also been added to the tests files.\r\n\r\nIf approved I will then take a look to update documentation showing these changes."

                "body": "What version of Gophish are you using?: \r\n0.7.1 (This would probably be 0.8)\r\n\r\nBrief description of the issue: \r\nI noticed a few issues, not just one and mentioned below. The target list contained 33K email IDs and the campaign landing page had a login page to check who submitted the data.\r\n- Campaign Stopped sending emails after sending 12K emails out of 33K but the campaign continued running. I had to create another campaign to deliver the rest of the emails. \r\n- Landing Page did not open in the browser for a long period of time, probably due to high load but it continued the tracking. Gophish service was running between 100 to 200% CPU. When load reduced then only landing page opened in the browser.\r\n- The campaign sent emails twice to some of the recipients, not to the entire target list.\r\n- Few Misc issues such as - Gophish service stopped once and landing page configuration page pointed to the old domain used in the past campaign.\r\n\r\nWhat are you expecting to see happen? :\r\n- The campaign must deliver emails to the uploaded list of targets, should not stop after sending a few emails.\r\n- Landing page should open in the browser despite the high cpu load, not sure if this caused it though)\r\n- The campaign should not send an email twice. The email sent twice to 5% of people out of total people. \r\n\r\nWhat are you seeing happen?\r\nSame as mentioned in the brief description.\r\n\r\nIf this question is related to email templates or landing pages not working as expected, please provide your template or landing page below:\r\n\r\n```html\r\nInsert code here\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease provide any terminal output that may be relevant below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nInsert output here\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease provide as many steps as you can to reproduce the problem:\r\n * Step 1 - \r\n * Step 2 - \r\n \r\n \r\n"

If it works for you, and it appears yahoo works, I will bang there and see what happens. \r\n\r\nThe error I got on Exchange I got with my outlook account so maybe could test Outlook in lieu of Exchange? Maybe Azure would have a free trail that allows access to Exchange?"

I've only tested the IMAP reporting on GMail and my own IMAP servers; so I'm not sure how Exchange handles things.\r\n\r\nAre there exchange servers I could connect to, or just sign up for an Outlook.com email address to try replicate your environment? I'd be pressed for time to setup a whole Exchange server.\r\n\r\nAs for your error `imap: unexpected completion status (\"STBGR2 NO [ALERT] Please log in via your web` - I got this too, and signed in via the web link and authorised the 'less secure' app. It seems you've done this, but GMail works fine for me.\r\n\r\nI'm quite busy with my day job at the moment but will try figure this out ASAP."
