I used to have a VPS running the latest version for audit reasons but that seems to have died and I've not been able to recover it (yet). The fastest option I can think of is taking a `neo-python` [bootstrap 4117000](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cityofzion/bootstrap_main/Main4117000.tar.gz) and the latest available  [chain.acc](https://sync.ngd.network/) from NGD and using `np-import` to sync back up (something like `np-import -m -a -i chain.acc --datadir <root folder containing \"Chains/Main/\">`). \r\n\r\niirc the `neo-python` bootstrap was made with `0.9.1`. That should be the fastest route to checking if it's a local chain issue or not."

I don't want to go back to the old CLI interface where there were hidden flags that you had to know.\r\n\r\nThere's actually no command-line flag to force the showing of the scripts in my patch. It really didn't seem useful to me at all to add that - for the reason you mentioned (yet another option to know about) and because I can't think of a single use-case for showing the script in a search result - it's not like you're going to look at it and say \"yeah, there's that contract I was looking for with the byte 0xfe at offset 0x12a\" (after manually counting that many bytes in the string). \r\n\r\nAnd usually by the time you've listed around 5 contracts you've already exceeded your scroll buffer max line size so even if there were a use-case for displaying every contract script in the search results it would be hobbled by that limitation as well.\r\n"
