                "body": "Hey there! I'm Erik, a developer of [another Python GroupMe bot](https://github.com/ErikBoesen/Yalebot). Motivated by frustration I experienced with building that bot, I recently developed [MeBots](http://mebots.co), which is a platform/API for building GroupMe bots more easily. It's designed to abstract away some of the headaches of maintaining GroupMe bots so that your job as a developer will be a little easier. I'm not sure if this bot is still operational, but if so, it could be a big help. For example, it has a whole built-in panel for adding and removing bots from different groups, and then it stores all the bot IDs and stuff in a database for you so you won't need to worry about keeping track of that data; you can just get what you need through a web API. Also, other people can add the bot to their own groups if you so choose. I think your bot could be of available to more people if it's on that marketplace and can be easily added by non-technical users. That way, anyone who wants puns in their chats could simply click a couple buttons and it'd be added to their private groups! No need to deploy to Heroku again as one instance would handle every chat.\r\n\r\nI've written up some documentation for how to integrate with the API here: http://mebots.co/documentation. This would not be a complex change: each time a message was sent to a chat, there would just be one simple API request to check which bot_id to send with, and the website takes care of all the adding/removing logic for you!\r\n\r\nI wrote some more specific documentation in the README of a pip package I made for easy integration with the API, which you can find [here](https://github.com/ErikBoesen/mebots.py), and there's a complete bot implementation [here](https://github.com/ErikBoesen/mebots-example-python)! I'm happy to make a PR integrating with the platform as well or answer any questions you may have about tradeoffs."
