(:issue:`1080`)\n> -   Restore the ``response`` argument to :exc:`~exceptions.Unauthorized`.\n>     (:pr:`1527`)\n> -   :exc:`~exceptions.Unauthorized` doesn't add the ``WWW-Authenticate``\n>     header if ``www_authenticate`` is not given. (:issue:`1516`)\n> -   The default URL converter correctly encodes bytes to string rather\n>     than representing them with ``b''``. (:issue:`1502`)\n> -   Fix the filename format string in\n>     :class:`~middleware.profiler.ProfilerMiddleware` to correctly handle\n>     float values. (:issue:`1511`)\n> -   Update :class:`~middleware.lint.LintMiddleware` to work on Python 3.\n>     (:issue:`1510`)\n> -   The debugger detects cycles in chained exceptions and does not time\n>     out in that case. (:issue:`1536`)\n> -   When running the development server in Docker, the debugger security\n>     pin is now unique per container.\n> \n> \n> Version 0.15.2\n> --------------\n> \n> Released 2019-04-02\n> \n> -   ``Rule`` code generation uses a filename that coverage will ignore.\n>     The previous value, \"generated\", was causing coverage to fail.\n>     (:issue:`1487`)\n> -   The test client removes the cookie header if there are no persisted\n>     cookies. This fixes an issue introduced in 0.15.0 where the cookies\n>     from the original request were used for redirects, causing functions\n>     such as logout to fail. (:issue:`1491`)\n> -   The test client copies the environ before passing it to the app, to\n>     prevent in-place modifications from affecting redirect requests.\n>     (:issue:`1498`)\n> -   The ``\"werkzeug\"`` logger only adds a handler if there is no handler\n>     configured for its level in the logging chain. This avoids double\n>     logging if other code configures logging first. (:issue:`1492`)\n> \n> \n> Version 0.15.1\n> --------------\n> \n> Released 2019-03-21\n> \n> -   :exc:`~exceptions.Unauthorized` takes ``description`` as the first\n></tr></table> ...

(:issue:`1080`)\n> -   Restore the ``response`` argument to :exc:`~exceptions.Unauthorized`.\n>     (:pr:`1527`)\n> -   :exc:`~exceptions.Unauthorized` doesn't add the ``WWW-Authenticate``\n>     header if ``www_authenticate`` is not given. (:issue:`1516`)\n> -   The default URL converter correctly encodes bytes to string rather\n>     than representing them with ``b''``. (:issue:`1502`)\n> -   Fix the filename format string in\n>     :class:`~middleware.profiler.ProfilerMiddleware` to correctly handle\n>     float values. (:issue:`1511`)\n> -   Update :class:`~middleware.lint.LintMiddleware` to work on Python 3.\n>     (:issue:`1510`)\n> -   The debugger detects cycles in chained exceptions and does not time\n>     out in that case. (:issue:`1536`)\n> -   When running the development server in Docker, the debugger security\n>     pin is now unique per container.\n> \n> \n> Version 0.15.2\n> --------------\n> \n> Released 2019-04-02\n> \n> -   ``Rule`` code generation uses a filename that coverage will ignore.\n>     The previous value, \"generated\", was causing coverage to fail.\n>     (:issue:`1487`)\n> -   The test client removes the cookie header if there are no persisted\n>     cookies. This fixes an issue introduced in 0.15.0 where the cookies\n>     from the original request were used for redirects, causing functions\n>     such as logout to fail. (:issue:`1491`)\n> -   The test client copies the environ before passing it to the app, to\n>     prevent in-place modifications from affecting redirect requests.\n>     (:issue:`1498`)\n> -   The ``\"werkzeug\"`` logger only adds a handler if there is no handler\n>     configured for its level in the logging chain. This avoids double\n>     logging if other code configures logging first. (:issue:`1492`)\n> \n> \n> Version 0.15.1\n> --------------\n> \n> Released 2019-03-21\n> \n> -   :exc:`~exceptions.Unauthorized` takes ``description`` as the first\n></tr></table> ...

(:issue:`1080`)\n> -   Restore the ``response`` argument to :exc:`~exceptions.Unauthorized`.\n>     (:pr:`1527`)\n> -   :exc:`~exceptions.Unauthorized` doesn't add the ``WWW-Authenticate``\n>     header if ``www_authenticate`` is not given. (:issue:`1516`)\n> -   The default URL converter correctly encodes bytes to string rather\n>     than representing them with ``b''``. (:issue:`1502`)\n> -   Fix the filename format string in\n>     :class:`~middleware.profiler.ProfilerMiddleware` to correctly handle\n>     float values. (:issue:`1511`)\n> -   Update :class:`~middleware.lint.LintMiddleware` to work on Python 3.\n>     (:issue:`1510`)\n> -   The debugger detects cycles in chained exceptions and does not time\n>     out in that case. (:issue:`1536`)\n> -   When running the development server in Docker, the debugger security\n>     pin is now unique per container.\n> \n> \n> Version 0.15.2\n> --------------\n> \n> Released 2019-04-02\n> \n> -   ``Rule`` code generation uses a filename that coverage will ignore.\n>     The previous value, \"generated\", was causing coverage to fail.\n>     (:issue:`1487`)\n> -   The test client removes the cookie header if there are no persisted\n>     cookies. This fixes an issue introduced in 0.15.0 where the cookies\n>     from the original request were used for redirects, causing functions\n>     such as logout to fail. (:issue:`1491`)\n> -   The test client copies the environ before passing it to the app, to\n>     prevent in-place modifications from affecting redirect requests.\n>     (:issue:`1498`)\n> -   The ``\"werkzeug\"`` logger only adds a handler if there is no handler\n>     configured for its level in the logging chain. This avoids double\n>     logging if other code configures logging first. (:issue:`1492`)\n> \n> \n> Version 0.15.1\n> --------------\n> \n> Released 2019-03-21\n> \n> -   :exc:`~exceptions.Unauthorized` takes ``description`` as the first\n></tr></table> ...

(:issue:`1080`)\n> -   Restore the ``response`` argument to :exc:`~exceptions.Unauthorized`.\n>     (:pr:`1527`)\n> -   :exc:`~exceptions.Unauthorized` doesn't add the ``WWW-Authenticate``\n>     header if ``www_authenticate`` is not given. (:issue:`1516`)\n> -   The default URL converter correctly encodes bytes to string rather\n>     than representing them with ``b''``. (:issue:`1502`)\n> -   Fix the filename format string in\n>     :class:`~middleware.profiler.ProfilerMiddleware` to correctly handle\n>     float values. (:issue:`1511`)\n> -   Update :class:`~middleware.lint.LintMiddleware` to work on Python 3.\n>     (:issue:`1510`)\n> -   The debugger detects cycles in chained exceptions and does not time\n>     out in that case. (:issue:`1536`)\n> -   When running the development server in Docker, the debugger security\n>     pin is now unique per container.\n> \n> \n> Version 0.15.2\n> --------------\n> \n> Released 2019-04-02\n> \n> -   ``Rule`` code generation uses a filename that coverage will ignore.\n>     The previous value, \"generated\", was causing coverage to fail.\n>     (:issue:`1487`)\n> -   The test client removes the cookie header if there are no persisted\n>     cookies. This fixes an issue introduced in 0.15.0 where the cookies\n>     from the original request were used for redirects, causing functions\n>     such as logout to fail. (:issue:`1491`)\n> -   The test client copies the environ before passing it to the app, to\n>     prevent in-place modifications from affecting redirect requests.\n>     (:issue:`1498`)\n> -   The ``\"werkzeug\"`` logger only adds a handler if there is no handler\n>     configured for its level in the logging chain.

(:issue:`1080`)\n> -   Restore the ``response`` argument to :exc:`~exceptions.Unauthorized`.\n>     (:pr:`1527`)\n> -   :exc:`~exceptions.Unauthorized` doesn't add the ``WWW-Authenticate``\n>     header if ``www_authenticate`` is not given. (:issue:`1516`)\n> -   The default URL converter correctly encodes bytes to string rather\n>     than representing them with ``b''``. (:issue:`1502`)\n> -   Fix the filename format string in\n>     :class:`~middleware.profiler.ProfilerMiddleware` to correctly handle\n>     float values. (:issue:`1511`)\n> -   Update :class:`~middleware.lint.LintMiddleware` to work on Python 3.\n>     (:issue:`1510`)\n> -   The debugger detects cycles in chained exceptions and does not time\n>     out in that case. (:issue:`1536`)\n> -   When running the development server in Docker, the debugger security\n>     pin is now unique per container.\n> \n> \n> Version 0.15.2\n> --------------\n> \n> Released 2019-04-02\n> \n> -   ``Rule`` code generation uses a filename that coverage will ignore.\n>     The previous value, \"generated\", was causing coverage to fail.\n>     (:issue:`1487`)\n> -   The test client removes the cookie header if there are no persisted\n>     cookies. This fixes an issue introduced in 0.15.0 where the cookies\n>     from the original request were used for redirects, causing functions\n>     such as logout to fail. (:issue:`1491`)\n> -   The test client copies the environ before passing it to the app, to\n>     prevent in-place modifications from affecting redirect requests.\n>     (:issue:`1498`)\n> -   The ``\"werkzeug\"`` logger only adds a handler if there is no handler\n>     configured for its level in the logging chain. This avoids double\n>     logging if other code configures logging first. (:issue:`1492`)\n> \n> \n> Version 0.15.1\n> --------------\n> \n> Released 2019-03-21\n> \n> -   :exc:`~exceptions.Unauthorized` takes ``description`` as the first\n></tr></table> ...
