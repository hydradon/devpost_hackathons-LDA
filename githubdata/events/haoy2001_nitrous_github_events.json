I also changed the link to the screenshot to a relative link in the repository so we aren't relying on an outside source. I set `?raw=true` from advice from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/10189374/10549827). It helps with some stuff related to forking, but in practicality it mostly just makes the image bigger (and in doing so, centers it, since it takes up the whole page).\r\n\r\n\ud83d\ude42",
