Plus, you will need one to be considered for Red Hat's _Best open source hack_ category! \ud83d\ude04 \r\n\r\n# Description\r\n\r\nGenerally, it is a good idea to use FSF or OSI-approved licenses (which can be found [here](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html) and [here](http://opensource.org/licenses/category)). Once you have chosen a license, you should place it in the root directory of your repository in a file named LICENSE.\r\n\r\nThe Free Software Foundation has a useful guide for [choosing a license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-recommendations.html). I often reference the Software Freedom Law Center's [Legal Primer](https://www.softwarefreedom.org/resources/2008/foss-primer.html#x1-60002.2) for both practical and academic purposes (highly recommended). [tldrlegal.com](https://tldrlegal.com/) is a useful resource for comparing the various FOSS licenses out there once you have some context and background to what they mean.\r\n\r\n# Resources\r\n\r\n* [tldrlegal](https://tldrlegal.com/)\r\n* [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGood luck for WiCHacks, and happy hacking! \ud83c\udf89 \ud83d\udcaf \ud83c\udf89 "
