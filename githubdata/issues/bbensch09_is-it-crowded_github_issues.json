        "body": "The changes are to the api_test.html file which reflects the move from SF Open Data API and JQuery, to Yelp's API and almost 100% Javascript to handle the Ajax call. \n\nSince we last met, I got help finding a script that would allow me to use pure JavaScript to set up an Ajax call to Yelp's API. Yelp's API provides us with more businesses and more detailed business info such as longitude, latitude, and phone number so that we can later work with Google Maps API's as well.\n\nFuture changes to the code will gather users selected/confirmed business and return that business info(name, location, etc) as an object so that it can be used by our backend code.\n\nI will be changing my Yelp authorization keys tomorrow for security reasons. Feel free to test the code by generating your own keys with Yelp.\n"
