Right now the only provider is [Temporal](temporal.cloud) but any provider who supports an [IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.io/reference/api/http/) can easily be added. \r\n\r\nCurrently we are having a problem saving the login token to local storage. The problem likely stems from lines 109-110 in `src/components/IPFS/Login.js`. It is getting called but it isn't setting the token. We have tried also setting the token with `JSON.stringify()` but that didn't seem to make difference either.\r\n\r\nI can be reached through github or on discord dc#8876\r\n\r\nYou can see this PR deployed at https://ens-app.temporal.cloud"

This is done in both the compiled template and the \"lookup\"-helper. \n>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been\n>   published recently.\n> \n> Compatibility notes: \n> \n> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using\n>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return \n>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.\n> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:\n> \n> ```js\n> {\n>   __proto__: 'some string'\n> }\n> ```\n> \n> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only \n>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases\n>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing\n>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.\n> \n> \n> \n> [Commits](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/compare/v4.5.2...v4.5.3)\n> \n> ## v4.5.2 - November 13th, 2019\n> # Bugfixes\n> \n> - fix: use String(field) in lookup when checking for \"constructor\" - d541378\n> - test: add fluent API for testing Handlebars - c2ac79c\n> \n> Compatibility notes:\n> - no incompatibility are to be expected\n></tr></table> ...

The variable $CYPRESS_TOKEN is not set within travis environment, so the cypress run fails.\r\n\r\nI understand that this is intended behaviour to prevent leaking of sensitive data through travis. The secret environment variables are not available in pull requests from other repositories. See https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/pull-requests/#pull-requests-and-security-restrictions for more info:\r\n\r\n> If your build relies on encrypted variables to run, for instance to run Selenium tests with BrowserStack or Sauce Labs, your build needs to take this into account. You won\u2019t be able to run these tests for pull requests from external contributors.\r\n> \r\n> To work around this, restrict these tests only to situations where the environment variables are available, or disable them for pull requests entirely,\r\n\r\nI'm not sure on the best approach to fix this. Change travis configuration (and probably package.json scripts) in a way that --record option is only used on the master branch? I think it depends on the requirements you have - when do you require to record the test run and when not?\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @TripleSpeeder in https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-app/pull/512#issuecomment-555903250_\r\n"
