This PR replaces all RawGit links with the recommended alternative - [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/). jsDelivr is a free and fast open source CDN hosting all files from GitHub and npm.\n\n*This is an automated PR which is meant to make the migration process as easy as possible. If something doesn't look right or you have any questions, feel free to ping MartinKolarik or jimaek in this PR. You may also use our [online migration tool](https://www.jsdelivr.com/rawgit) to convert other RawGit links to jsDelivr links.*"
