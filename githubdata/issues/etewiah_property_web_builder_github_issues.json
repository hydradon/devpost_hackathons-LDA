Not everyone uses an MLS and sometimes this is the easiest way to migrate from another website provider where only a few properties are listed.\r\nI already looked into this and it will be a bit tricky.  Some sites can't be scraped and each one that can be scraped will need some slightly different rules.\r\nIt offers some interesting possibilities though so I will work on it.  Eventually if there is enough demand it could be a useful distinguishing feature.\r\nIt could even evolve to be a tool for monitoring changes in other listings across the web - particularly the price.  Who knows.  I'm open to suggestions and ideas."

        "body": "The number 1 feature request I have received since launching PropertyWebBuilder has been to add support for importing MLS data.\r\nThis is on my TODO list and I'm looking at various options such as:\r\n\r\n- Connect directly to MLSs that support RETS using a gem such as https://github.com/josephholsten/rets4r or https://github.com/estately/rets\r\n- Use a third party intermediate service like https://retsrabbit.com or https://simplyrets.com \r\n- Create my own huginn agent (https://github.com/cantino/huginn) to use as an intermediate service\r\n\r\nThe third option is likely to be the most difficult and time consuming but it is also the one that most appeals to me.  Huginn is an amazing tool and using it would open up the possibility to accommodate new endpoints for importing data more easily.  I will investigate it some more over the coming days and update this issue on the progress I make.  \r\n\r\nIf this feature is of interest to you (either as a developer or a realtor) feel free to comment on this issue."
