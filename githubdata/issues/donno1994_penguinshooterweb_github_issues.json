I want to improve the project.\r\n\r\nI am a beginner in creating websites (never done it before). Do you have any suggestions on that?\r\nWhat could I do better?\r\n\r\nIf you want to help me, you can clone my repository, change the Project1.html file (PenguinShooterWeb/PenguinShooterWeb_Data/Resources/Project1.html) <br>and open a pull request. Best would be to run the webserver and watch the website through that. If you just open that html file, you will not see any invoices etc.\r\n\r\nEnjoy the game and start being awesome!!"
