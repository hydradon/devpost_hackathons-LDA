Is the hazard table within PostGIS on the order of 50GB or less?\n\nI am attempting to do a similar conversion using ogr2ogr of a more recent file NFHL_08082016.gdb by converting from this ESRI GDB directly into a PostGIS DB and after a half-day's worth of conversion, the files are not fully converted yet and I am wondering how much longer it shall take to complete the conversion/upload into PostGIS.\n\nThanks!\n-tph018\n"
