This is standard for the tool, but if the configuration file specified in the preferences is not present, linting within VSCode no longer works.\r\n\r\nI installed the extension and struggled with getting it to work before I realized the configuration file might be the issue. Blanking out the configuration file entry and adding a configuration file both fixed the problem, but no warning is given if the configuration file cannot be found, and the extension fails silently."
