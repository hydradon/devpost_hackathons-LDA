I have a project setup with architecture similar to the IceCreamShop Samples. The Provider-Interfaces are being passed through the properties to the react component.\r\n\r\nThis works like a charm. From the outside I can provide specific implementations or within a test I can provide mocks.\r\n\r\nHowever. When working with nested components this architecture ends up in bubbling the interfaces / dependencies from one property to the next property until it gets consumed by a nested child component.\r\n\r\nQuestion: How would you implement a dependency injection in your example?\r\n\r\nI have read many articles about react and di, but somehow I do not feel satisfied with all of them.\r\nUsing the reacts context as a place for sharing interface implementations feels wrong to me.\r\nHigher Object Components are more suitable for compositing controls and I do not see a good strategy for resolving dependencies here.\r\n\r\nThe more I read, the more I am tempting to use third party modules like inversify.\r\n\r\nWhat would you suggest?\r\n\r\nI believe that in your example the most straight forward way would be having a possiblity to say:\r\n\r\nexport class IceCreamShop....\r\n\r\n\r\nConstructor( // auto inject IIceCreamProvider here )...\r\n\r\nThanks for your opinion.\r\n\r\nRegards"

This includes when multiple site sources from across the hub site are being pulled in.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Observed Behavior\r\n\r\nIn Safari 13.0.4 for MacOS 10.15.2 and in all browsers in iPadOS 13.3, any page featuring the News webpart in \"Hub News\" layout load either extremely slowly (up to 5 minutes) or timeout. \r\n\r\nInitially on MacOS, the Safari windows displays a white page, then Safari freezes followed by spinning beachball of death. This can last up to a minute. Then the page begins to load, but very slowly with long delays for webparts to render. The browser scrollbar locks until the page is fully loaded. This seems to cause intense CPU activity on Mac and causes the fans to kick in. \r\n\r\nOn iPadOS, all apps that browse the web must use the WebKit framework, meaning this issue applies to all tested browsers: Safari, Edge, Chrome and the iOS SharePoint app.\r\n\r\nIn my tests, as soon as the News wepbart is switched from \"Hub News\" to another layout, performance is immediately improved. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nOpen a page utlizing the News webpart in \"Hub News\" view in Safari for MacOS or any web browser on iPadOS, including the iOS SharePoint app. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\nThe \"Hub News\" layout is a very useful webpart, as it enables us to display multiple news items from across out tenant without taking up much space. It is invaluable on our intranet homepage, enabling our staff to view news at a glance.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this issue has a negative impact on our hundreds of iPad users, who immediately run into issues when they try to access the intranet on their devices. This is therefore a major issue for us.\r\n\r\nNote that I have raised this issue through our official tenant support channels and have attempted to have it escalated. \r\n"

The Save button just refreshes the page (or if I have set up the redirect URL, redirects to that URL). \r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nAdd this web part to a page. Link it to a list where there are mandatory fields and custom column validations. Set the Form Type to New and Publish the page. Then try to create a new list item which misses some of the mandatory fields or violates the column validations. Notice that the error messages are not displayed on the page. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for your contribution! Sharing is caring.\r\n"

However, all event cards display a name, days and time taken, but not the type of event registered. It will be useful to also include the type of event on the card for the sake of matching a color to an event type. For example, the scenario of leave types (Sick, PTO, Vacation, Bereavement, etc.).\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.  Download repo\r\n\r\n2. Select react-calendar to build and package\r\n\r\n3. Install app on SharePoint environment\r\n\r\n4. Add app to site contents\r\n\r\n5. Add web part to SharePoint modern page and select desired calendar in property panel "

Events represented on the calendar via Microsoft Flow displays 1 hour later that applied for. For example, if I request personal time off from 12pm - 4pm, the event registered on the calendar displays the time as 13:00H - 17:00H. If I were to add an event directly to the calendar via the property panel, the event registers correctly. However, we are not allowing this functionality, as our only method of adding events to the calendar is via Microsoft Flow.\r\n\r\n2. Items created by Microsoft Flow that are represented on the calendar displays in the color of blue and does not randomize. If I were to add an event directly to the calendar via the property panel, and I refresh the page, the event color randomizes. In my previous calendar, I had specific colors to represent each type of event.\r\n"

If I add an event to the group that is scheduled for all day on the 10th January (10/01/2020 at 00:00 to 11/01/2020 at 00:00), it will display in the webpart or team app on the 11th January (11/01/2020 at 00:00 to 12/01/2020 at 00:00).\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nI have added the Teams app and SharePoint WebPart to various teams, both recently created and 1 Year + old teams and it does the same on all of them. I have checked the timezones on the teams and my client and everything is UK/London as the same as my Outlook client. I have also tried cloning a fresh version and re-installing it to my app catalog however it still does the same thing.\r\n\r\nIf I add Microsoft's own Group Calendar web part, the events show the correct date and times. Also, if I use the Microsoft Graph explorer and pull the events for that group it shows them with the correct timings so it doesn't appear to be anything to do with the groups themselves.\r\n"

The user will select multiple documents and will click the extension button. The extension should open outlook client with the selected documents as attachment. I have created eml file and attached attachments using base64 encoding. But currently, I am only able to download the eml file, and not able to open it directly with outlook client. \r\n\r\nOther approaches which I am not using and their reason: \r\n\r\n- **mailto** : I cannot attach file using mailto. So this option is not used.\r\n- **ActiveX control** : It works only in IE. for some reason, it didn't work in IE also today. \r\n\r\nArticle to refer for the code - https://blogs.perficient.com/2016/10/17/create-a-microsoft-outlook-email-using-javascript/\r\n\r\nPlease let me know programmatically how I can achieve this?(through Javascript/ typescript/React JS) \r\n\r\n\r\n#spfx, #spfx-webparts"

We suggest\n>     that you always recompile your templates with the latest compiler in your build pipelines.\n> \n> - Disallow calling \"helperMissing\" and \"blockHelperMissing\" directly - 2078c72\n>   - Calling \"helperMissing\" and \"blockHelperMissing\" directly from a template (like in `{{blockHelperMissing}}` was \n>     never intended and was part of the exploits that have been revealed early in 2019 \n>     (see https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1495). *It is also part of a new exploit that \n>     is not captured by the earlier fix.* In order to harden Handlebars against such exploits, calling thos helpers \n>     is now not possible anymore. *Overriding* those helpers is still possible.\n>   - If you really need this behavior, you can set the runtime option `allowCallsToHelperMissing` to `true` and the\n>     calls will again be possible\n> \n> Both bullet points imly that Handlebars is not 100% percent compatible to 4.2.0, despite the minor version bump.\n> \n> We consider it more important to resolve a major security issue than to maintain 100% compatibility.\n> \n>     \n> \n> [Commits](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/compare/v4.2.1...v4.3.0)\n> \n> ## v4.2.1 - September 20th, 2019\n> Bugfixes: \n> \n> - The \"browser\" property in the package.json has been updated to use the common-js builds instead of the minified UMD - c55a7be, [#1553](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1553)\n> \n> Compatibility notes:\n> - No compatibility issues should arise\n> \n> [Commits](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/compare/v4.2.0...v4.2.1)\n> \n> ## v4.2.0 - September 3rd, 2019\n> Chore/Test:\n> - Use custom `grunt-saucelab` with current sauce-connect proxy - f119497\n> - Add framework for various integration tests - f9cce4d\n></tr></table> ...
