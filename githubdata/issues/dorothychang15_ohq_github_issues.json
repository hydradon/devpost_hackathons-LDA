One possible solution to this mentioned at Friday's staff meeting was to use Penn keys to track students instead. This solution partially solves the problem, but it does not address the concern that  one student can remove another student from the list if they know that other person's Penn key. Also, the UX of having to enter your name again to remove yourself from the queue could be better. I propose that we instead assign each student a secret token when they add themselves to the queue that we can store in local storage. When they want to remove themselves, we simply retrieve the token from local storage instead of prompting them for their name."

This means that the password is no longer stored in plaintext in the source code of the website, responding to multiple people's complaints during Friday's staff meeting. Now, in order for someone to crack the password, they would need to reverse the precomputed SHA256 hash (which is quite a task). That being said, other security flaws still exist in the process that should probably be addressed before launch."
