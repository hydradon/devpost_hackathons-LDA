I think it would do very well, especially if you re-framed it as a way to help people who have a disability and aren't able to record lectures themselves.  Applications are due tomorrow - Sunday, April 8th. http://aka.ms/ImagineCupCanada (I know this is really soon, but you can take exactly what you presented at NWHacks and submit that....you'll be able to work on the project post-submitting it)\r\n\r\nIf you're interested:\r\n1. Register at https://aka.ms/SubmitCanadaImagineCup\r\n2. Take your DevPost submission + your GitHub code and use it to fill out the https://aka.ms/CANImagineCupTemplate\r\n3. (Optional) Record a demo/walkthrough video of how your project works (doesn't need to be fancy)\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, feel free to reach out to our team directly at ImagineCupCanada@microsoft.com"
