You have middleware/sendText.js but you also have `twillio.js`. I don't think you need either. You can just put the code into the controller route you are going to send a text from. When you are sending many texts, then refactor into a separate module. YAGNI. (your twillio credentials might be exposed in the middleware/sendText.js file. not sure.\r\n1. `settings.js` is a pretty weird name. Actually all of your controllers except for `users.js` are kind of weird b/c they are mostly not resourceful. Make sure you use resourceful routes. I'd recommmend `index`, `users`, `journals`, and `entries`. \r\n\r\nOverall great work: tighten up your UI, use resourceful naming conventions for your routes, and excited to see more recipes added to this. \r\n\r\nI'd like to see your make your donation button go to a real checkout page, not just the drop in checkout.js snippet. If you want!"
