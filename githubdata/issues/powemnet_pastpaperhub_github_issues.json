We suggest\n>     that you always recompile your templates with the latest compiler in your build pipelines.\n> \n> - Disallow calling \"helperMissing\" and \"blockHelperMissing\" directly - 2078c72\n>   - Calling \"helperMissing\" and \"blockHelperMissing\" directly from a template (like in `{{blockHelperMissing}}` was \n>     never intended and was part of the exploits that have been revealed early in 2019 \n>     (see https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1495). *It is also part of a new exploit that \n>     is not captured by the earlier fix.* In order to harden Handlebars against such exploits, calling thos helpers \n>     is now not possible anymore. *Overriding* those helpers is still possible.\n>   - If you really need this behavior, you can set the runtime option `allowCallsToHelperMissing` to `true` and the\n>     calls will again be possible\n> \n> Both bullet points imly that Handlebars is not 100% percent compatible to 4.2.0, despite the minor version bump.\n> \n> We consider it more important to resolve a major security issue than to maintain 100% compatibility.\n> \n>     \n> \n> [Commits](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/compare/v4.2.1...v4.3.0)\n> \n> ## v4.2.1 - September 20th, 2019\n> Bugfixes: \n> \n> - The \"browser\" property in the package.json has been updated to use the common-js builds instead of the minified UMD - c55a7be, [#1553](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1553)\n> \n> Compatibility notes:\n> - No compatibility issues should arise\n> \n> [Commits](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/compare/v4.2.0...v4.2.1)\n> \n> ## v4.2.0 - September 3rd, 2019\n> Chore/Test:\n> - Use custom `grunt-saucelab` with current sauce-connect proxy - f119497\n> - Add framework for various integration tests - f9cce4d\n></tr></table> ...
