        "body": "Adding support for multi-exchange strategies (looking for arbitrage opportunities, for example) will require the reworking of several core modules. The strategy `evaluate` / `gen_order` interface will need to have an additional keyword specifying which exchange a particular tick came from, and the `backtest` function will need to iterate through multiple sets of ticks, interleaving such that timestamps are all in a proper order. An elegant way to accomplish this, and to allow for future changes like this one to be easier, might be to create a tick class that has a timestamp field, a price field, a quantity field, and now an exchange field.\r\n\r\n"
