We use a number innovative technologies including home-grown dumpster fullness sensor system, collection routing based on fullness, weight-based load records. The idea of recognizing an object and assigning it a waste stream classification (recyclable, clean paper, compostable food waste, cardboard, trash, etc.) could be very helpful. If you are interested in discussing your app, contact me.\r\nChris Leverenz\r\ncleveren@ucsc.edu"
