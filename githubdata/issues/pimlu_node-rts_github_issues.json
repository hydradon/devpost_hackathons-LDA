My best guess is that since we [check if the WebSocket buffer is close to empty](https://github.com/pimlu/node-rts/blob/333b501726379ed3b40ce64b62712a02669792e3/rts/RTSServer.js#L61), his connection is just slow and it's waiting while the buffer empties to send more data.  (this is preferable to it sending a continuous stream of outdated information)\n\nThe proposed solution is to send typed arrays of 32 bit floats, which can cut the traffic by more than a factor of 4.\n"
