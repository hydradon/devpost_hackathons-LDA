POs in Multnomah requested the ability to select multiple contact methods when sending a message, so they can message the client and the lawyer at the same time with the same message.\r\n\r\n**Note**\r\nWe'd need to do some UX and design investigation and work here to make sure this is seamless, but I think it's a really interesting idea. I don't know if POs want to have multiple threads going in the same message stream, or if they'd want a filter, etc. One potential workaround is to automatically create (and update) a group for all contact methods associated with a client, so a PO can send a group message out...idk. Worth investigating!"

(This is because there's a wildcard A record in the `clientcomm.org` hosted zone that intercepts requests for subdomains unless they're explicitly noted)\r\n- [ ] Once the mailgun record sets are created, you'll have to [verify the domain setup](https://documentation.mailgun.com/user_manual.html#verifying-your-domain) on the mailgun site. Also, the mailgun SMTP password (`TF_VAR_mailgun_smtp_password`) is a value that can be retrieved from mailgun and is expected in the environment variables. These details should be added to the deploy README.\r\n- [x] The [initialize deploy script](https://github.com/slco-2016/clientcomm/blob/master/devTools/initializeDeploy.js) isn't working on the new servers; it hangs when trying to access the database. Figure out why and fix it."
