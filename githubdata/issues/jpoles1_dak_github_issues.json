It works by emulating Belkin WeMo outlets on the network; these devices can be detected by Alexa and used for Smart-Home control. Currently this script (echo/dak_switches.py) is enabled by default, and device names are hardcoded into the script. Ultimately, I hope to have the python script automatically pull device names from the DAK system.\r\n"
