We suggest\n>     that you always recompile your templates with the latest compiler in your build pipelines.\n> \n> - Disallow calling \"helperMissing\" and \"blockHelperMissing\" directly - 2078c72\n>   - Calling \"helperMissing\" and \"blockHelperMissing\" directly from a template (like in `{{blockHelperMissing}}` was \n>     never intended and was part of the exploits that have been revealed early in 2019 \n>     (see https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1495). *It is also part of a new exploit that \n>     is not captured by the earlier fix.* In order to harden Handlebars against such exploits, calling thos helpers \n>     is now not possible anymore. *Overriding* those helpers is still possible.\n>   - If you really need this behavior, you can set the runtime option `allowCallsToHelperMissing` to `true` and the\n>     calls will again be possible\n> \n> Both bullet points imly that Handlebars is not 100% percent compatible to 4.2.0, despite the minor version bump.\n> \n> We consider it more important to resolve a major security issue than to maintain 100% compatibility.\n> \n>     \n> \n> [Commits](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/compare/v4.2.1...v4.3.0)\n> \n> ## v4.2.1 - September 20th, 2019\n> Bugfixes: \n> \n> - The \"browser\" property in the package.json has been updated to use the common-js builds instead of the minified UMD - c55a7be, [#1553](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1553)\n> \n> Compatibility notes:\n> - No compatibility issues should arise\n> \n> [Commits](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/compare/v4.2.0...v4.2.1)\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n\n- [`a89081d`](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/commit/a89081d440a9da9f3f25835f47de837907b0094a) v4.3.0\n- [`bba6560`](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/commit/bba65605b111965bc1e1643a489a3b3c56f190b3) Update release notes\n- [`06b7224`](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/commit/06b7224ed94ad00d342be416250305a8cb92112b) adjust compiler revision\n- [`2078c72`](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/commit/2078c727c627f25d4a149962f05c1e069beb18bc) Disallow calling \"helperMissing\" and \"blockHelperMissing\" directly\n- [`fff3e40`](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/commit/fff3e40402c9f9cd790984560658646a26e1c930) v4.2.1\n- [`35bcd44`](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/commit/35bcd4405fad758520308754f05b88c97c7b380c) Update release notes\n- [`00b4f2f`](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/commit/00b4f2ff98bf6285cc551f090166a92a70196124) Fix some small typos.\n- [`e47b5ec`](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/commit/e47b5ec192392cee548c5c01dc85b72b0fc8419b) integration-tests for various webpack-scenarios\n- [`c55a7be`](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/commit/c55a7bed781b4cff132d18d778bf16268ce34f01) fix: use cjs for browser fields\n- See full diff in [compare view](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/compare/v4.2.0...v4.3.0)\n</details>\n<br />\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=handlebars&package-manager=npm_and_yarn&previous-version=4.2.0&new-version=4.3.0)](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-automated-security-fixes)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.
