It was a pleasure to participate in DeltaHacks V, and compete in one of the triangle challenges. Through my commitments as a software developer and as a research student focusing on pediatric epilepsy, I realize that cross-discipline integration is an essential component in the progression of ideas into reality and to bolster social change. I am extremely thankful to have a hardworking team with me, and I hope to learn much more from the judges and fellow hackers. Some of my academic interests include the interaction between the human brain and computer and artificial intelligence. Find me on LinkedIn and GitHub!\r\n\r\nAbijith Mani\r\nI'm a third-year student studying Electrical Engineering & Society with a minor in Business at McMaster University. I'm goal-oriented and I aspire to learn and apply my skills in both academic and career experiences. DeltaHacks V has allowed me to focus in order to develop versatility, and multi-tasking so that I can put forward the best product I can in the allocated time. \r\n\r\nRushil Malik\r\nI'm a second-year student at the University of Western Ontario specializing in Film Studies as well as Media, Information, and Technoculture. Although I'm relatively new to coding, DeltaHacks V has provided me with the unique opportunity to explore outside of my comfort zone in order to develop new skills. Coming from an arts and media program, I understand the importance of design and user experience. I look forward to all the brilliant ideas that were actualized in this hackathon and can't wait to go to my next hackathon! "
