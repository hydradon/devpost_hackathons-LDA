This is required by Greenkeeper because it uses your CI build statuses to figure out when to notify you about breaking changes.\n\nSince we didn\u2019t receive a CI status on the [`greenkeeper/initial`](https://github.com/VandyHacks/trvl/commits/greenkeeper/initial) branch, it\u2019s possible that you don\u2019t have CI set up yet. We recommend using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org), but Greenkeeper will work with every other CI service as well.\n\nIf you _have_ already set up a CI for this repository, you might need to check how it\u2019s configured. Make sure it is set to run on all new branches. If you don\u2019t want it to run on absolutely every branch, you can whitelist branches starting with `greenkeeper/`.\n\nOnce you have installed and configured CI on this repository correctly, you\u2019ll need to re-trigger Greenkeeper\u2019s initial pull request. To do this, please delete the `greenkeeper/initial` branch in this repository, and then remove and re-add this repository to the Greenkeeper App\u2019s white list on Github. You'll find this list on your repo or organization\u2019s __settings__ page, under __Installed GitHub Apps__.\n"
