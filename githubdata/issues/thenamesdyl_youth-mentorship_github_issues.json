I was disappointed to see your account banned because your technical answers helped me A LOT!\r\n\r\nI remember that in one answer you had recommended a book for OOP. I had bookmarked that answer but now its gone with your account :-(\r\n\r\n\r\nCould you please tell me what book you had recommended for OOP? Or what book you recommend now?\r\n\r\nsorry again for doing this. btw I hate dumb Quora mods"
