Once the performance is understood it will be incorporated into the much larger project and mostly re-written.\r\n\r\nThe performance test will be simple -- we will just run each of the 'go', 'rust' and 'c++' versions against the same folder (with maybe 1000 copies of the data file) using 'time':\r\n\r\n  >  time rust_scanner\r\n  >  time go_scanner\r\n  >  time cpp_scanner\r\n\r\nThere's no need for elaborate options parsing, although the folder name can be a command line option.\r\n\r\nThe C++ and Go versions are already written and can be found in ./src/other/parallel/cpp in the develop branch.

The registry is newly deployed at [0x00000000000C2E074eC69A0dFb2997BA6C7d2e1e](https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000000C2E074eC69A0dFb2997BA6C7d2e1e).\n\n### Workarounds\nDo not accept transfers of ENS domains from other users on the old registrar.\n\nCheck the [migration guide](https://docs.ens.domains/ens-migration/guide-for-dapp-developers) in our docs.\n"

        "body": "The `getBalance` command should have a new set of options:\r\n\r\n- --period [five|hourly|daily|weekly|monthly|annually|nblocks]\r\n- alternatively --weekly, --monthly, --yearly, --quarterly\r\n- (or better yet enhance the block range parse code so it works for any tool)\r\n\r\nWe can use code from the `whenBlock` as the method by which to determine the most recent block number prior to the first second of the period.\r\n\r\nFor example, if `--weekly` is chosen, then the most recent block prior to the `startBlock` is Sunday morning midnight. Then, it should step through each Sunday morning midnight after that prior to `endBlock`. The code that generates the list of blocks to report on should first snap back to the start and then report  until the end of the range.\r\n\r\nThe best solution would alter the code in CBlockOptions class to allow for this option (although it could be that the command line interface is as above, while underneath, it could use this ability). This would allow the enhancement to benefit every tool that takes a block range. Possible examples:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngetBalance <address> 5000000-6000000:weekly\r\ngetBalance <address> --weekly 5000000-6000000\r\nwhenBlock 0-latest:daily\r\n```\r\nIf we add options such as --weekly, --daily, etc. these options should be available to all tools so this would be a change at the library level."

How do we do that? We make a .gz file of the source code tree, do `ipfs add` and store that hash (or maybe that hash and the commit in GIT) as the first record in any data we create.\r\n\r\nFlat Buffers is great because it lets me build a flat file that needs no parsing. What I like about it is it has an arbitrary header. We can store this \u2018code hash\u2019 in the header to prove how the data was derived, and the data is \u2018provably true.\u2019\r\n\r\nJust thinking out loud. I\u2019ll add this to an issue."

This will start scraping the block difficulties. Note that this script is pretty hacky. If you stop the script and then resume, there is no guarantee that all the block difficulties will be included in the final output. I could easily clean this up tonight, just let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks,"

        "body": "I'm pretty sure the `blockScrape` app skips over the DDos blocks between `DevCon2` and `State Clear` (at least it used to).\r\n\r\nThis means that all transactions during that time period are not included in the bloom filters.\r\n\r\nAt one point, I tried to fix this with this command: `getBloom --start devcon2 --end stateclear --force` which isn't right, but it sort of worked. I should fix the `blockScrape` code. \r\n\r\n**An example:**\r\nAllow `blockScrape` to run with no options on a clean install, quit after block 2,700,000 and enter this command:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbloomMan 0x6d343663e55f734781e278b2b41a36c99e0bac40 2627736 -v:3\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt will tell you `false` (i.e. the address is not in the block).\r\n\r\nNow run:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbloomMan --rewrite 2627736\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen run the above command again. It will return `true. \r\n\r\n**Note:** This may no longer be true, so if above doesn't work, just close this issue."
