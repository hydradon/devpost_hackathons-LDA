Furthermore, each user doesn't get fully their own chunk, there is a lot of overlap in who gets what to ensure data redundency in case one peer goes offline. If a DropBox server dies, you don't use access to your data. Why should you lose your data on Ishtar?\"\r\n\r\n\"If a DropBox server dies, you don't use access to your data.\""
