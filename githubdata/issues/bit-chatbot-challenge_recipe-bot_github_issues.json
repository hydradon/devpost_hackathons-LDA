        "body": "Let's improve how the ingredient lists are scaled.  New functionality should account for:\r\n\r\n- fractions\r\n- word measurements (e.g., a dash of salt)\r\n- automatic pluralization of units (e.g., 1 tablespoon to 2 tablespoons)\r\n- natural conversion (5 gallons of milk instead of 20 quarts of milk)\r\n- handling both full and abbreviated names of units (e.g., tablespoons == tbsp)\r\n\r\nTo do this, we should probably spin this into a parsing module within the bot.  We can create one using [Parsley](http://parsley.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html) for parsing and [Units](http://pint.readthedocs.io/en/0.8.1/index.html) to handle units."
