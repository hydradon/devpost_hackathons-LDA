But do all services need to be made HA? As Suresh (@smarru ) pointed out, we need to consider points such as:\r\n\r\n- Whether the service maintains state information?\r\n- Whether service data need to be replicated for HA?\r\n\r\nI would love to hear more about what you guys feel.

Higher priority tasks go first.\r\n- [ ] If CPI/API needed, then implement them.\r\n- [ ] Implement unit-tests for scheduler service"
