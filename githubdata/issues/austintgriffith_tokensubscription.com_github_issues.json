In fact, I want to set up grant to cover gas and development costs.\r\n\r\nIs it possible that someone else make grants and subscriptions for me or send me small amount of ETH for gas costs? Are there some other options?\r\n\r\nMy Ethereum address: `0xF4f49771c15d1c638d2660CD5c1A6b4DCEa547F8`\r\n\r\n> I am starting with Ethereum projects development.\r\n> \r\n> I'm developing some Ethereum projects, so I would need some grant to cover costs for this, specially for GAS cost and deployment.\r\n> I'm also contributing to other (Ethereum and different) projects.\r\n> \r\n> Please make a small grant to me to help me cover my costs for developing projects.\r\n> Thank you!"
