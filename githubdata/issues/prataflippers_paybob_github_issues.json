The issue is that the controllers are failing to import Database and so I am not merging the changes into master\r\n\r\nFor the config file, I have used yaml and currently the file (config.yml) only has:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntelegram:\r\n    TOKEN: 452146569:AAEdRQMubxBqRpSWYFs931wnUFja8vdHIIQ\r\n\r\ndatabase:\r\n    file: paybot.sqlite\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this PR is merged, we should reset the token and not use it in any file except for config.yml"
