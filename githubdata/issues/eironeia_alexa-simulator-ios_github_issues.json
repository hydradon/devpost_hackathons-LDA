I have integrated Amazon login option for end user to authorise the account, after authorisation I got the accesstoken from Amazon API. I am sending that token for calling AVS service this is working as expected.I already link the user to my own system successfully. \r\n\r\n   Now the issue is when i receive the request from AWS lambda function i received the another token. Why it is like this ?\r\n"
