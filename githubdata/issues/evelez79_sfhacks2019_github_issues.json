This probably shouldn't happen to avoid misconceptions that the countries are supported with a data set. \r\n\r\nThis was solved before with 9aac49fdafd8ba0a8ec90461d4d2c1acc8283f1f but that led to the issue of countries turning blue when clicked, and @DanMossa suggested that new layers were actually being added to the map when non-supported countries were clicked."
