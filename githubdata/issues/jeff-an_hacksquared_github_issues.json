Applications are due on Sunday, April 8th. http://aka.ms/ImagineCupCanada\r\n\r\nIf you're interested: \r\n1. Register at https://aka.ms/SubmitCanadaImagineCup \r\n2. Take your DevPost submission above + your GitHub code and use it to fill out the https://aka.ms/CANImagineCupTemplate \r\n3. Record a demo/walkthrough video of how your project works (doesn't need to be fancy)\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, feel free to reach out to our team directly at ImagineCupCanada@microsoft.com\r\n"
