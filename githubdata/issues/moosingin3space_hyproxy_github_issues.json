        "body": "One thing that none of the prevailing reverse proxy solutions except for Traefik handle the need for an elastic (or previously unknown) set of upstream servers.   A compelling feature for hyproxy would be the ability to be able to resolve DNS on the fly (and cache the collection of servers for a short time) for upstreams.   Varnish-Goto can do that, but even it isn't quite as flexible as I'd like for our kubernetes cluster, where the proxy may not know that an endpoint exists before I synthesize the upstream dns name. \r\n\r\nExample : \r\ninbound request:\r\nhost: foosvc.loadbalancer.mycluster.org\r\nGets translated to Kubernetes local service as the upstream address:\r\nfoosvc.svc.default.cluster.local\r\n\r\n(we don't know that foosvc exists until we receive a request for it) \r\n\r\nI understand that it is absolutely not trivial, and would likely require a concurrent thread that is curating the resulting pools of  URL -> IP address mappings.   But it it had such a feature, it would become immediately useable in any kubernetes, docker-swarm, or mesosphere cluster with almost 0 configuration.  And no need to communicate with the cluster oracles. "

The `hyper-0.11.x` branch is async. You're most welcome to use them if you find them helpful; and if you don't find them helpful, I'd like to fix that.\r\n\r\nMy crate's young. There's no continuous build yet; the docs haven't gotten much attention; the APIs aren't stable yet; and I'm not in love with the current names `http-entity` and `http-file`. On the bright side, that means it's a good time if you have strong opinions on these things. Some possible upcoming API changes:\r\n\r\n   * the type of a given Entity's body stream and chunk type could become associate types rather than the current generics.\r\n   * `http_entity::serve` could become a trait method rather than its current free function. My habit is pure interfaces from languages such as Go, but it seems a lot of Rust stuff such as futures puts a lot of functionality in trait methods that the implementer doesn't need to override.\r\n   * `http_file::ChunkedReadFile::new` could move into a builder."
