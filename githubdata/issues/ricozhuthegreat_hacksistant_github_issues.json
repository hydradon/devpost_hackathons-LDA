Please try to use [valid selectors](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#value-def-identifier) or the `data-target` HTML attribute/`target` option where available.\r\n> - **Fixed:** Reverted v4.2.1's change to the breakpoint and grid container Sass maps that blocked folks from upgrading when modifying those default variables.\r\n> - **Fixed:** Restored `white-space: nowrap` to `.dropdown-toggle` (before v4.2.1 it was on all `.btn`s) so carets don't wrap to new lines.\r\n> - **Deprecated:** `img-retina`, `invisible`, `float`, and `size` mixins are now deprecated and will be removed in v5.\r\n> \r\n> ### Links\r\n> - [Read the full ship list](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/27893)\r\n> - [Review the project board](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/projects/16)\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n\n- [`8fa0d30`](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/commit/8fa0d3010112dca5dd6dd501173415856001ba8b) Release v4.3.1.
