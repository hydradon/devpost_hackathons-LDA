Currently, our API just ignores one and sends an empty list, but doesn't store it in the cache.\r\n\r\nTo fix this issue we will probably have to start to throttle how fast we are making queries for large profiles when we get a 403 we just wait for a second or two and try again. In their [documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting) we are allowed 5000 queries per hour. \r\n\r\nWe should also start logging how many queries we make to GitHub so that we can figure out if we are approaching the limit.\r\n\r\nWays to get more queries:\r\n- We could use the client to make some queries that we don't have on our behalf and send the responses back to the server for caching (we could then sample these queries to make sure they are valid). This would help supplement our cause because every potential user has 60 queries that they can make.\r\n- For larger more intensive graphs we decide to make in the future (stuff to do with user/repository events), we may have to have the user authenticate with our application so the requests are associated with their account.
