        "body": "Hi all, \r\nFirst of all, thank you so much for releasing such a brilliant work. I need your help in understanding the tutorial jupyter-notebook of training our own QA. Before I tried to trained \"our own data\", I managed to run DocProductPresentation successfully (as well as downloading all necessary files). \r\n\r\nTo trained our own data, I downloaded the \"sampleData.csv\" and Train_Your_Own_QA  notebook file. When I tried to run the training, I notice that I got OOM error (My GPU is RTX 2070 8GB). So, my first step is to reduce the batch size by half and so on. However, even after I set batch size to 1, I still got OOM error. Therefore, I played a little bit with \"bert_config.json\" from BioBert pre-train model and change the num_hidden_layers to 6 (default is 12) and it ran. Also, I noticed that you set the num_epochs to 1 so I didn't change it. \r\n\r\nOnce the training is finished (it took around 35 mins), I used DocProductPresentation notebook to test the new model. However, the result is totally out of the topic from the question I asked. Therefore to test if this new model work as intended, I copied one question from \"sampleData.csv\" and I still got out of topic answer.\r\n\r\n So, my questions are, \r\n1. What GPU you use to trained your model? Is 8 GB VRAM not enough? Does the OOM error comes from Loading BioBERT model or from your architecture?\r\n2. Did you use num_epochs 1 in training \"sampleData.csv\" and got good result? If not, what are good parameters I need to use?\r\n3. I notice, you used \"Float16EmbeddingsExpanded.pkl\" in DocProductPresentation notebook but not in the training our own QA. Then, what is the importance of this file?\r\n4. Does the answer is auto-generated or just retrieved from \"sampleData.csv\"? If this is a retrieval, the model must look from a some kind of database or a pool of QA, where is this?\r\n5. Also, I couldn't find some of the result answers from the \"sampleData.csv\", where do these answers come from?\r\n\r\nThank you so much for your help."
