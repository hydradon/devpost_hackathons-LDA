However, we're still pondering this issue.\n\nIf I put a file in /keybase/private/me,you/ I can actually make it a symlink to something totally outside the folder, like some path on your machine. when you read it, you'll see your own private data. There could be some attacks with this. (In the keybase.pub case, for example, we don't want to be tricked into serving the server's own private files.)\n\nAnyway, bringing this up because I haven't thought of what a malicious chat partner could do over your RPC layer by making their file link elsewhere. It's worth thinking about\n"
