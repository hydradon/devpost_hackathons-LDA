        "body": "Hi @mifeng Would be awesome to have ETHLend (Decentralized peer to peer lending platform) as source, they allow anyone to become lender and fund the loans available in their platform with accepted currencies as DAI, ETH and LEND (even ETH pegged options) and interests from 0.25 to 5% Monthly. They provide an SDK to be able to interact with the platform:\r\nGithub:\r\nhttps://github.com/aave/aave-js\r\nNPM Package:\r\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/aave-js"
