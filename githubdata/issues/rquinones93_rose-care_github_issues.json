If any of the two contained a string with a double quote in it, then that would enable an SQL injection. This was previously a feature of `tableName`, before the introduction of a separate `schemaName`, as that allowed a schema to be defined as part of `tableName`. Defining schema name through `tableName` is still supported after this fix, but is now *deprecated*.\r\n> * **Fix:** Errors wasn't propagated properly.
