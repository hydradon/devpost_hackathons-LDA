        "body": "**The Problem**\r\nAdvertisement based monetization sacrifices truthful free speech at the alter of share holder profits. \r\n\r\n**The Reaction**\r\nVarious tactics, but basically censorship of content creators by platform moderators because how advertisers have threatened to stop spending their money on their major platforms like Twitter, Youtube, ect.\r\n\r\n**The Solution**\r\nRemove the advertisers from the equation entirely. Simply put, \"monetize the Like\"\r\n\r\n________\r\n\r\n**Concept:**\r\nUsers monetize their content by virtue of receiving likes from other app users, which translates into a small tip of cryptocurrency (BTC).\r\n\r\n**Limits**\r\n\r\n- Users must have funds available to spend, in order to \"Like\" someone else's content. \r\n- Without leveraging a batching process for tips, then network fees will make this un-viable. \r\n- Payouts presumably are batched at a threshold of pending tips, thus not instantly sent/received upon literal Liking of the content.\r\n\r\n**Benefits**\r\nUser content monetization would no longer subject to the politically motivated whims of advertisers. In other words you could not be demonetized for \"not being advertiser friendly\".\r\n\r\n**Development Requirements**\r\n\r\nWe need to bind the the `Upvote` and `Favorite` together as one action for the user, aka the `Like` .\r\n\r\nIn order to monetize Likes for Remark, upon **`Like`** (Upvote/Favorite) we the functionality to:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add `this` `sound_timestamp.json` to the users  `my_fav_sounds.json`\r\n- [ ] Add `this` `sound_timestamp.json` to the users  `my_votes.json`\r\n- [ ] Add the content creator name (`FQN`) + `this` `sound_timestamp.json` + tip amount,  to the users `my_pending_tips.json`\r\n \r\nNote: if the user \"**unlikes**\" the sound, it should remove the reference from the two previously mentioned files (`my_fav_sounds.json`, `my_votes.json`, and remove from `my_pending_tips.json` if still pending a tip payment).\r\n\r\nUpon the `my_pending_tips.json` threshold configuration being met, execute the Batch payout derived from BTC proofs found in the FQN's of the entries in the `my_pending_tips.json`\r\n\r\n**Threshold Settings and Constraints**: \r\n- [ ] The threshold configuration settings for the tips should be defined in the `my_settings.json`\r\n- [ ] Constrain the likability of `this` content to `this` user so that they can only \"Like\" if their wallet meets the available minimum balance of BTC in their wallet in order to cover the pay outs of Likes when batched. (available balance is equal to the onchain balance Minus the sum of pending payouts)"
