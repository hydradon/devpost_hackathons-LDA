Why dont they contribute to society?\r\nTruth: like 50% of them are under the age of 11. like 80% or more are children, or women with children. No wonder it takes like 10-15 years before they pay more in taxes than they cost, these people should be in school!\r\n\r\nI want to find a way to include stuff like this, charts and graphs, maybe a bar at the bottom that updates every 30 seconds or something like a news ticker... lets talk about it."
