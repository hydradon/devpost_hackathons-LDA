We have to take into account that we need a strong id in order to use quadratic voting (one account per user).\r\n\r\nApplied to our current system, we only have to square root the staked tokens and multiply it by a scaling factor before we pass them as `oldAmount` param in the `calculateConviction(uint64 timePassed, uint256 lastConv, uint256 oldAmount)` function. A very simple and optional change that can have a lot of implications for communities that decide to go this way, giving more conviction power to small token holders.\r\n\r\nIt has a lot of sense to combine this with splitting the vote into various proposals (see #36)."

Ternary choice is an optional extension to the mechanics, to add an \u201cactive resistance\u201d by enabling token holders to \u201csupport against\u201d.\r\n\r\nRight now we only support the binary choice (staking tokens or not), and I think that the third option can be very interesting for many communities. We should not only enforce the freedom to have, but also the freedom to not have.\r\n\r\nAs a silly example, imagine somebody wants to \"Build a wall between US and Mexico\". With our current conviction voting system, if a big enough group of people are convinced enough (during enough time) their proposal is going to pass, despite the majoritarian opinion of the group is against it. A ternary choice voting could protect the entire group of misaligned ideas.\r\n\r\nThoughts on this?"

        "body": "The conviction formula that @dapplion came up on [ETHParis](https://hackmd.io/jWlia12DQ6SBLpKGLP9_-g) is as follows:\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y_t=\\alpha^ty_0+x\\frac{1-\\alpha^t}{1-\\alpha}\" /></p>\r\n\r\nThis has been very useful to derivate other functions such as the max amount of conviction a proposal can have, the time it is required for a proposal to pass with current conviction and stakes, etc.\r\n\r\nHe also provided a Solidity implementation that deals with the lack of decimals in that language. He uses a parameter `D = 10` to augment <img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\\alpha\" /> and <img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\\alpha^t\" />, so instead of <img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\\alpha=0.9\" /> we have <img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\\alpha_D=9\" />:\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y_t=\\frac{1}{D^t}[\\alpha_D^t%20y_0+xD\\frac{D^t-\\alpha_D^t}{D-\\alpha_D}]\"/></p>\r\n\r\nBut to do so we need to calculate <img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?D^t\"/> and <img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\\alpha%20D^t\"/>. In Solidity:\r\n```go\r\n// Predefined params\r\npragma solidity >=0.4.22 <0.6.0;\r\ncontract ConvictionComputation {\r\n    uint D = 10;\r\n    uint aD = 9;\r\n    // Sample state\r\n    uint y0 = 0;\r\n    uint x = 1e18;\r\n    function conviction(uint t) public view returns (uint) {\r\n        uint Dt = D**t;\r\n        uint aDt = aD**t;\r\n        uint y = (aDt * y0 + (x*D*(Dt-aDt))/(D-aD)) / Dt;\r\n        return y;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe problem with that approach is that uint variables `Dt` and `aDt` overflow when `t > 77` and `t > 90` respectively. In other words, after 77 units of time from last stake or withdraw, the function becomes unreliable because it tries to calculate a number beyond the maximum unsigned integer (2^256-1).\r\n\r\nA single approach to deal with that is to consider `t=77` the last secure number, and consider <img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\\alpha^t=0\" /> from that moment onwards, so the conviction formula for `t > 77` is:\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y_t=x\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}\" /></p>\r\n\r\nThis is the approach we take right now in our code:\r\nhttps://github.com/1Hive/conviction-voting-app/blob/7c6a13006c29afb6dc35f2b22b1ec022299ebdcc/contracts/ConvictionVotingApp.sol#L232-L237\r\n\r\nIt is a good enough solution for now, but we should find a better solution because we are losing a lot of precision if we consider <img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\\alpha^t\" /> to be 0 when it really is <img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\\alpha^t=0.9^{78}=0.000269722\" />. If we don't find anything better, we can just consider an implementation quirk, in which tokens are fully activated after 77 units of time.\r\n\r\n"

As it stands we would only support non-transferrable tokens and make the assumption that users would not have a way to burn/transfer those tokens (eg not have redemptions or fundraising installed)... \r\n\r\nHowever, it is likely that orgs will want one or both of redemptions/fundraising installed, and it would also be nice to be able to support transferrable tokens. \r\n\r\nAutark has done some work to make a version of the token manager that has a notion of a transferability oracle which may be a good way to handle this: https://github.com/AutarkLabs/aragon-apps/blob/token-manager-oracle/apps/token-manager/contracts/TokenManager.sol \r\n\r\nWe could create an oracle as part of the conviction voting app and have that hooked into this modified token manager.
