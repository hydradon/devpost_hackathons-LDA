Know when the other user's portfile tab is open / active (or as an extension to functionality, queueing files for a fixed number of downloads?)\r\n2. Application playing nicely with adblockers and popup blockers\r\n3. A transfer progress indicator (not critical since the current native file download dialog works well too)\r\n4. \r\n\r\nMore as I come up with them. Great job!\r\n"
