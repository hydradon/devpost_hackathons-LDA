I'm definetly not a programming expert , and i know almost nothing about JS, but i tried to use Spotify Blindtest , without being able to use it.\r\nSo i started the server.js , went to localhost:8888 , then when i log into spotify , the server closes. \r\nI reopen it and i'm able to go to the Playlist page , but it is empty. At this point i'm pretty much stuck and don't really now what to do. I hope this page isn't dead and someone will manage to help me."
