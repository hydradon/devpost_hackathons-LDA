Please double-check.  I noticed this because of a LinkedIn post that highlighted them.  https://www.linkedin.com/posts/businessrobotics_rpa-uipath-roboticprocessautomation-activity-6581071294845022208-aeE1/\r\n\r\nIn particular the False Negatives of 42% seemed really out of wack with the rest of the metrics.  I think you flipped the values for \"False Negative Rate\" and \"False Positive Rate\".  Also check the accuracy calculation."
