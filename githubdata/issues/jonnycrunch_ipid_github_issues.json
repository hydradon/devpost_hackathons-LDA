It is actually very close to IPFS, was actually around before IPFS, and [Juan Benet actually worked on it](https://github.com/ipfs/faq/issues/119#issuecomment-218278390) before branching off to IPFS, which was based on Dat.\r\n\r\nI suggest this because the Dat URL is static, even if you change the files (in this case, the DID Doc), so you wouldn't have to update IPNS with every change. Might be a better for for SSI?\r\n\r\nAs a scientist, you might consider looking into [Dat ](https://dat.foundation/) also, it's sponsored by https://codeforscience.org/ and was originally designed for sharing large data sets."

That being said, should the spec state how these situations should be resolved? Should we look into using CRDTs so that all devices converge to the same DID Document that gets published?
