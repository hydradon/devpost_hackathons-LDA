When I go to read 1 it works - but if i go go \"next\" or say \"read #2\" it says no other articles after reading the 1st one!\r\n\r\nAlso, if i have numerous articles (i.e. more than 10) i won't be able to remember which was is which number - would be nice if it just started by reading the headlines, and if you didn't have to mention an article number - better if you could just say \"alexa read\" when a headline is read to you - then say \"alexa next\" either in the middle or end of that article to be able to go from article to article all in a row but not be required to listen to each fully.  Let me know if these are possibities - otherwise I won't be able to use this skill. Thanks."
