There is currently only one transaction with unclaimed gas: `5a6fd5a783fb1673bc8d7aebb981e6d96c64da1a0f0448e47c65f23e367253f3`\r\n\r\nneo-python thinks the total GAS to claim is `4.70274012`. Neoscan and Neotracker, on the other hand, both report the total GAS to claim as `4.84828396`:\r\n\r\nhttps://neoscan.io/address/AZXKdEc2M73qeQMmPj2zmKJFDWmzQf8Gyr\r\nhttps://neotracker.io/address/AZXKdEc2M73qeQMmPj2zmKJFDWmzQf8Gyr\r\n\r\nMy suspicion is that something in neo-python's calculation is wrong.\r\n\r\nWhen you try to claim GAS for this transaction, here is the claim transaction that is created:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclaim tx: {\r\n    \"txid\": \"0x7c60e83ee9f52e0d788e28675911f2e1e8e2e3554e3ee64007205b7b12e5b92f\",\r\n    \"size\": 292,\r\n    \"type\": \"ClaimTransaction\",\r\n    \"version\": 0,\r\n    \"attributes\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"usage\": 32,\r\n            \"data\": \"3f1d5432d67d24228574206849b1d7a7a96d632b\"\r\n        }\r\n    ],\r\n    \"vout\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"n\": 0,\r\n            \"asset\": \"0x602c79718b16e442de58778e148d0b1084e3b2dffd5de6b7b16cee7969282de7\",\r\n            \"value\": \"4.70274012\",\r\n            \"address\": \"AZXKdEc2M73qeQMmPj2zmKJFDWmzQf8Gyr\"\r\n        }\r\n    ],\r\n    \"vin\": [],\r\n    \"sys_fee\": \"0\",\r\n    \"net_fee\": \"0\",\r\n    \"scripts\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"invocation\": \"40caa705bf7f7d17ec6e70a7e66332f7cde7cd2b26d8f4024474d5263156cd752e084fdb8feadb656eb33b74601065d5009fb155a6eaf3a744ec73384218d7047b\",\r\n            \"verification\": \"21024ab2c861a603070407c119a692adb697a4e99a66494a307534a0097549fa7d70ac\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"invocation\": \"00407a517831ab0c50a697ae119b863feb867e7d04a6b945c475de85718c1d19067913eea1aa58d16317f03fccd92fa40a84d6d31f697e3423c69441a7741aba15ea\",\r\n            \"verification\": \"\"\r\n        }\r\n    ],\r\n    \"claims\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"txid\": \"0x5a6fd5a783fb1673bc8d7aebb981e6d96c64da1a0f0448e47c65f23e367253f3\",\r\n            \"vout\": 0\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis transaction gets relayed, but it's never actually processed, presumably because it's not valid.\r\n\r\nNote that there were 12 other transactions for which I was able to successfully claim gas (by modifying neo-python to process one claim at a time), so it appears there is something special about the gas calculation for this specific transaction that is causing the problem.\r\n\r\nNote also that this is a smart contract address, so I don't know if that has anything to do with it.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to help debug/troubleshoot if it's helpful.\r\n\r\n### Your environment\r\n\r\nLet us know in what environment you're running into the issue:\r\n\r\n- OS: macOS 10.15.2\r\n- neo-python version: `v0.9.2-dev`\r\n- Python version: `3.7.4`"

This is because the `--i` flag used the `gather_params` helper function and the regular command line parsing did not.\r\n\r\n**How did you solve this problem?**\r\nI split out the parameter verification into a separate function: `verify_params` and added a `user_entry` flag to limit verification to user entered params.\r\n- verifies parameters input via command line and --i flag\r\n- ensures parameter input is identical\r\n- does not disrupt existing logic which had previously caused many errors in #972\r\n\r\n**How did you make sure your solution works?**\r\nmanual testing\r\n\r\n**Are there any special changes in the code that we should be aware of?**\r\nYes, new parameter parsing affected some gas costs and one return value from previous tests. See https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-python/pull/973/commits/efb6ef47887237822d8ad1c844b3a794255bcece\r\n I think these are good changes seeing as they mirror the results if the `--i` flag was used.\r\n\r\n**Please check the following, if applicable:**\r\n\r\n- [x] Did you add any tests?\r\n- [x] Did you run `make lint`?\r\n- [x] Did you run `make test`?\r\n- [x] Are you making a PR to a feature branch or development rather than master?\r\n- [x] Did you add an entry to `CHANGELOG.rst`?

        "body": "This is a TODO for a project (see side bar)\r\n\r\nAs part of the Lightweight SDK API we would like to have a class that eases creation of (raw) transactions. A raw transaction can be understood as a serialised `Transaction` that can be send to the network via a RPC node or directly on the TCP network.  \r\n\r\nThe available `Transaction`s and their possible attributes are described in the [documentation](https://docs.neo.org/en-us/network/network-protocol.html). There are 2 existing examples on how to manually build raw transactions in python [here](https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-python/blob/master/examples/build_raw_transactions.py). From that code you can see there is enough room to simplify this for the end user. e.g. adding a description attribute to the transaction is currently done as follows\r\n```python\r\n contract_tx.Attributes.append(TransactionAttribute(usage=TransactionAttributeUsage.Description, data=\"My raw contract transaction description\"))\r\n``` \r\na simplified interface could be\r\n```python\r\ncontract_tx.addDescription(\"My raw contract transaction description\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n Some ideas:\r\n- simplify adding TX attributes (see example above)\r\n- simplify setting transaction destinations. Currently you have to create `TransactionOutput`s ([ref](https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-python/blob/e561e5b57d4093a9ee0c87a8312d4a4d16f6fd5e/examples/build_raw_transactions.py#L88)) using script hashes and alike. Instead we could support an API like `contract_tx.set_destination_addr(\"neo address\")`\r\n- support loading raw TX's and inspection\r\n- support TX validation e.g. \r\n    - check that `CertUrl, DescriptionUrl, Description, Remark series` do not exceed 255 chars (see docs)\r\n    - check that `ContractHash, ECDH series, Hash series` does not exceed 32 bytes (see docs)\r\n    - check that there are no more than 16 attributes per TX ([ref](https://github.com/neo-project/neo/blob/7cf286941f7f5541e2ab4bf182583452eec8fc5a/neo/Network/P2P/Payloads/Transaction.cs#L23))\r\n    - check that the maximum TX size is not exceeded ([ref](https://github.com/neo-project/neo/blob/7cf286941f7f5541e2ab4bf182583452eec8fc5a/neo/Network/P2P/Payloads/Transaction.cs#L19)) \r\n\r\n\r\nFor the first iteration we should only support the following transactions\r\n- [ClaimTransaction](https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-python/blob/master/neo/Core/TX/ClaimTransaction.py) - for claiming GAS\r\n- [ContractTransaction](https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-python/blob/e561e5b57d4093a9ee0c87a8312d4a4d16f6fd5e/neo/Core/TX/Transaction.py#L766) - for sending NEO/GAS\r\n- [InvocationTransaction](https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-python/blob/master/neo/Core/TX/InvocationTransaction.py) - for interacting with smart contracts"

On top of that they\u2019ll likely have to run their own full node which is not always needed or more important wanted/possible.\r\n\r\nIn order to ease their entry into the NEO ecosystem via Python we want to support a light weight API that acts more like [Neon-js](https://github.com/CityOfZion/neon-js/) and [NeoModules](https://github.com/CityOfZion/NeoModules). These rely on [public RPC nodes](http://monitor.cityofzion.io/), [NeoScan](https://neoscan.io) and alike for providing Blockchain related data and broadcasting capabilities.\r\n"

        "body": "_Rationale:_\r\nThe current CLI can be described as a vertical scrolling log where the bottom line is interactive and allows for command inputs that get displayed in the log. While it gives a quick historical overview, it is not suited for interactive inspection of data such as Blocks and Transactions. \r\n\r\nEvent logging is interlaced with command history and can clutter the view. Error messages can even disrupt the proper representation of the statusbar (see below). In short, there is enough room for improvement \r\n![console](https://i.imgur.com/YuFyNLE.png)\r\n\r\n_Goal:_\r\nCreate a clean interactive CLI. The [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/ ) CLI is a great example how interactive and clean a console application can be. It uses the [urwid](http://urwid.org/) library for the heavy lifting (beware it has a steep learning curve).\r\n\r\nCLI wishes:\r\n\r\n- Allow for interactive block / transaction inspection. \r\n- A minimal example of how that could look can be see [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/410364599133667328/469956379059159042/neo-python-console.mov)\r\n- Work on all platforms (Windows/Linux/OSX). The Windows requirement can be the usage of Cygwin or a proper capable terminal.\r\n- Separate log messages from command and block history (e.g. see how mitxproxy has a splitpane capability)\r\n- Have plugin based command support (see the related issue: [Refactor prompt commands to be plugin based](https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-python/issues/623))\r\n"
