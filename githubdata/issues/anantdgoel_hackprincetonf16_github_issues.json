I love this though and thanks for doing it! \r\n\r\n- Have you considered using something more like an ad blocker model of having a blacklist of sites to minimize the server stress? \r\n  - Example: https://docs.google.com/document/d/10eA5-mCZLSS4MQY5QGb5ewC3VAL6pLkT53V_81ZyitM/preview\r\n  - I like that this list categorizes sites also based on type of content.\r\n- My plan was to literally call bullshit on some of these sites and slap a poop emoji on them. That and make sure you saw a popup if you tried to go to the site so you could get the warning before reading. This might be fun and a good way to get some attention. \r\n- Giving people a way to edit the list of accepted sites would be helpful just in case someone wants to use it but has exceptions or visits sites not on the list already.\r\n\r\nI may have some time to help on these, if you're interested, but wanted to throw them out there, just in case."
