        "body": "When a user of our API requests information about an organization by giving us an EIN, we will return everything we know about that EIN, regardless of which IRS data file had the information. \n\nCurrently, when you search for an EIN (e.g. http://charityapi.org/api/v1/eins/000003154) it will return an organization object as JSON, but a lot of the fields are null/nil. We need to start filling in those fields. \n\nThe postcard model is a model for a list of postcards sent to the IRS from the charities. The charities with under 50K in donations each year only need to send in these postcards. The info in these postcards contain some information we should include with our response about the organization. \n\nTask: \n1. Create two postcard fixtures that have the same EIN as one of the organizations in the organizations.yml file. Make each postcard a different year of course, but otherwise they can be pretty similar. \n2. Write a method in models/organization.rb that will find postcards that match the given organization and pull data from them and save it to itself, preferring the most recent data available. \n3. Write a test that makes sure the organization method works and saves only the most recent information for each field. Make sure the method doesn't blow up if it doesn't find any postcards. \n\nThis little method is pretty suitable for writing a test first, where you know the correct answers (the fixtures) and then start writing the code and trying to think up what might cause it to break in practice. \n"
