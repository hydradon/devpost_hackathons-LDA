        "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nWhat is currently missing and really disappointing in Musish is that there's no album release date in album information window.\r\nFor example: https://beta.music.apple.com/ru/album/man-on-the-run-track-by-track-commentary/947975010 has it - 2014\r\nBut https://musi.sh/album/911604957 - no.\r\n\r\nAlso it looks to me that albums are not sorted anyhow or the logic is unclear. Normally albums should be sorted by the release date which luckily beta.music.apple.com/ does.\r\nIt would be really good if you could improve this.\r\n\r\nThank you!"

This is apparent both from listening and from using the browser's developer console to monitor network traffic - the amount of data being transferred after selecting a song matches up with 64kbps and is not nearly enough to be a 256kbps audio stream. For example, playing a nearly 4 minute long song transferred 2.89MB of data, with almost a MB of which is jpeg and script resources for the page, and a little under 2MB making up the actual mp4 chunks. \r\n\r\nThe Widevine DRM module is set to always activated in Firefox. Session storage shows that the play.itunes.apple.com.WebObjects.MZPlay.woa.wa.widevineCert key is populated with an array length of 5, so it does appear to be loading in a certificate. I have attempted clearing the browser cache, disabling all extensions, toggling the quality option in Musish back and forth, etc. so far to no avail.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce on my machine is to simply play any song, as this is affecting the entire client rather than any particular tracks or albums."

Go to My library , songs\r\n2. Click on play and turn on random play icon\r\n3. Click on the list icon (most right icon with small numbers) to see the random play list\r\nand realize only a limited number of songs are possible. \r\n4. Click the Next song icon, several times till you notice, only a small set of songs are possible in the random play.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe random list should get songs from all the 1000 favorites, not just the beginning of it.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: [e.g. iOS] ubuntu 18\r\n - Browser [e.g. chrome, safari] Chrome \r\n - Version [e.g. 22]  75.0.3770.100\r\n\r\n**workaround**\r\nScroll down list of all songs, till the end - very slow. Click random icon again."
