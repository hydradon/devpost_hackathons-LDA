Please try to use [valid selectors](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#value-def-identifier) or the `data-target` HTML attribute/`target` option where available.\r\n> - **Fixed:** Reverted v4.2.1's change to the breakpoint and grid container Sass maps that blocked folks from upgrading when modifying those default variables.\r\n> - **Fixed:** Restored `white-space: nowrap` to `.dropdown-toggle` (before v4.2.1 it was on all `.btn`s) so carets don't wrap to new lines.\r\n> - **Deprecated:** `img-retina`, `invisible`, `float`, and `size` mixins are now deprecated and will be removed in v5.\r\n> \r\n> ### Links\r\n> - [Read the full ship list](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/27893)\r\n> - [Review the project board](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/projects/16)\n> \n> ## v4.2.1\n> Bump to v4.2.1 to republish package on npm. [See v4.2.0 release notes](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases/tag/v4.2.0) for changes introduced in v4.2.\n> \n> ## v4.2.0\n> Here are the highlights of what's new and updated in v4.2.\r\n> \r\n> - **New:** Added a new spinner loading component.\r\n> - **New:** Added new toast component for displaying notifications.\r\n> - **New:** Added a new iOS style switch (a modifier class to our custom checkboxes).\r\n> - **New:** Added touch support in our carousel component.\r\n> - **New:** Added `.font-weight-lighter` and `.font-weight-bolder` utilities.\r\n> - **New:** Added `.text-decoration-none` utility class.\r\n> - **New:** Added `.modal-xl` modifier class for our modals.\r\n> - **New:** Added new negative margin utility classes (e.g., `.mb-n3`). These rad new classes not only allow you more control over your general spacing needs, but also allow you to create responsive grid gutters at each breakpoint.\r\n> - **New:** Validated form fields now have feedback icons on `:invalid` and `:valid` fields. Disable them with the `$enable-validation-icons` boolean Sass variable (defaults to `true`).\r\n> - **New:** Added a new versions page to our docs\r\n> - **New:** Tooltips/Popovers work with Shadow DOM\r\n> - **Updated:** Redesigned the custom checkboxes and radios for more obvious states.\r\n> - **Updated:** `bootstrap-grid.css` now includes our `margin` and `padding` utilities for full control of our grid system.\r\n> - **Updated:** Changed auto columns (e.g., `.col-auto`) from `max-width: none` to `max-width: 100%` to prevent content from causing a column to overflow the parent.\r\n> - **Updated:** Improved rendering of custom selects, ranges, file input, and more.\r\n> \r\n> Checkout the full [v4.2.0 ship list](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/26952) and [GitHub project](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/projects/6) for the full details. Up next is [v4.3](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/projects/16) with some bugfixes, a few new modifier classes and variables, and some new utilities.\r\n> \r\n> [Head to to the v4.2.x docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.2/) to see the latest in action. The full release has been published to npm and will soon appear on the Bootstrap CDN and Rubygems.\n> \n> ## v4.1.3\n></tr></table> ...
