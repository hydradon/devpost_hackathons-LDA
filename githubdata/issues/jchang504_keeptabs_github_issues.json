As before, everything works normally if you click out of the editing window (e.g. top of the page). Needs investigation to figure out what's going on.

The only case where it's a more than cosmetic problem is tab search, where the results can be obscured within a small window.

We should probably have an [onInstalled](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/runtime#event-onInstalled) page pop up like some extensions, with some README-like information on how to use the extension and maybe direct the user to options (KeepTabs doesn't do that much until you've added some hotkeys).\r\n2. We also need to consider how to make the extension work a) immediately upon install and b) after an update. I think the way b) works is the browser auto-updates when the extension isn't running; i.e. in our case when the browser is fully closed. That's okay-ish, although many users probably never fully close Chrome and might instead try manually updating/reloading -- which would break KT functionality until they reload their tabs, as we've always dealt with in development. a) also needs thought, because tabs currently open when the user installs KT will not have the content script, and so won't have KT active on them. I think there's a way to inject the content script into those pages for a seamless experience. Both these items can be explained away in the onInstalled page, but of course it's better to have it be automatic and seamless for the user."

But there are some UI improvements that I didn't have time to figure out, mostly related to weird stuff happening with the tab search filtering (maybe related to fuse):\r\n\r\n1. Even though I call `populate()` when opening the tab search, no results show until the user inputs something; this differs from the original popup tab search behavior and isn't horrible, but it would be better if it just showed all the tabs at the start.\r\n2. The fuse fuzzy search seems to be keeping some state and \"remembering\" the previous search, as even after backspacing and deleting all the characters, the results are different (related to previously typed characters) than a plain list of all the tabs."

        "body": "A rather obscure tab navigation feature on Chrome is the ability to use the scroll wheel on the tab bar to do left-right (no wraparound) tab navigation. It's actually pretty nice, but having to be on the tab bar is a little weird. It would be cool to try having this feature enabled by holding the hold key instead of having the cursor on the tab bar. In particular, this gives the user a way to switch tabs with only one hand on the keyboard (the current left-right nav requires two; #33 also addresses this), particularly when they're already using the mouse with the other hand. I find this is a pretty common use case for myself, and it results in me still sometimes clicking to switch tabs (gasp). Definitely more of an experimental (#49) feature though."

But the (background script in particular) console log is starting to get a little cluttered as the extension does more and more, and there are definitely distinct levels of log messages that are all using LOG_INFO right now (e.g. major user-level actions like \"Navigate to previous tab\" and fine implementation details (good for debugging) like when the `last_window_id` or `last_tab_id` are updated). Maybe even just one more level for the finer details, LOG_DEBUG or something, would be enough. Google's [glog](http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/docs/glog.html) even provides a integer argument-specified VLOG macro that allows you to specify an arbitrary integer logging level, but I think that's too far (as well as hard for multiple contributors to intuitively agree on in their usage, because what does logging level \"4\" mean?). @Sophtware, what do you think?"

        "body": "Even for the current default hold key (escape), all the built-in hotkeys are nice and intuitive, but they can't be performed with one hand (even given my caps lock mapped to escape). It would be nice to have a one-hand (particularly, left hand) version of them available for when you have one hand on the mouse, as you might for certain types of web browsing. You could even just use some of the alphabet keys on the extreme left, like q, w, a, z. In that case, we'd probably have to make them fully customizable (in case the user would rather pick other letters). The other question is whether they should exist in addition to or replacing the current defaults. The former seems kind of confusing, so I'm thinking the latter. This seems relatively simpler to implement too as the built-ins would basically become like normal customizable hotkeys (customizable on the options page) but with special preset functionality (and we'd also allow non-alphabet hotkeys for these). This should probably be implemented along with #1."
