I will list the current issues and then describe them further:\r\n\r\n- Integrate location.html with the rest of the project. \r\n- Figure out how to do popups properly.\r\n- Use popups instead of full pages for links\r\n- Need to add an About and Contact page/popup/whatever\r\n- Need to prepare to present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. I moved location.html and location.js from relevancy and put these files in the tests folder. Unfortunately, right now our current latitude/longitude coordinates are hard-coded into the API call because I had trouble getting the google map to render, due likely to the fact location.js is tightly coupled with an event handler.\r\n2. Popups are currently a pain in the ass to style properly, see \"Diagnose-Me\" for a lesson on how to make really bad UI design. Different resolutions have different sized white backgrounds, extra borders, etc. However, popups for all of my triggers/buttons are almost unanimously a better solution\r\n3. More reiterating of 2, instead of having \"Find Pharmacy\" and \"Get Extra Care\" link to entirely different pages, it would be a \r\n good idea to use popups instead.\r\n4. It's just more professional to have an about/contact page. Don't have to talk Y'all into this one I think\r\n5. Don't have any specific tips regarding this one.\r\n"
