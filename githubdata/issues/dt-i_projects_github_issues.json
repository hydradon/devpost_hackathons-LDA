        "body": "Collateral consequences are legal and regulatory sanctions and restrictions that limit or prohibit people with criminal records from accessing employment, occupational licensing, housing, voting, education, and other opportunities. Collateral consequences most frequently affect people who have been convicted of a crime, though in some states an arrest alone\u2014even an arrest that doesn't result in a conviction\u2014may trigger a collateral consequence.\r\n\r\nSome collateral consequences serve a legitimate public safety or regulatory function, such as keeping firearms out of the hands of people convicted of domestic violence offenses, prohibiting people convicted of abuse from working with children or the elderly, or barring people convicted of fraud from positions of public trust. Others are directly related to the particular crime, such as registration requirements for sex offenders, driver\u2019s license restrictions for people convicted of a serious traffic offense, or debarment of people convicted of fraud. But many collateral consequences apply to people convicted of any crime, without regard to any relationship between the crime and opportunity being restricted, and frequently without consideration of how long ago the crime occurred or the person\u2019s rehabilitation efforts since. Collateral consequences with overbroad restrictions that offer no chance to overcome the restriction function as additional punishment and may discourage rehabilitation and ultimately increase recidivism.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is a way to make this information easier to digest than what is [currently offered](https://niccc.csgjusticecenter.org/map/).\r\n\r\nThis issue is worked upon as part of the [TubmanProject hackathon issue 5](https://github.com/TubmanProject/project-ideas/issues/5).\r\n\r\nHere is the Devpost link of the project:\r\nhttps://devpost.com/software/what-s-the-catch\r\n\r\nInitial work can found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Sllrdw1srWk8xDHHxGXf0142d4LNFu9O).\r\n"

        "body": "TLAP (Transition to Life After Prison) is the project dedicated to providing support to prisoners coming back after finishing their sentence. There are obstacles that people with criminal records face when they attempt to re-enter society and become productive, law-abiding citizens. Our research found that people with criminal records seeking reentry face a daunting array of counterproductive, debilitating and unreasonable roadblocks in almost every important aspect of life.\r\nStarting from the moment they are released, many prisoner lack sense of direction to further steps to ways to get accepted by society. Many times being none of the family or friend around and with minimal financial aid, they lack the visibility to find basic living requirements such as a place to stay overnight, to get a job and get back on feet. The report from Legal Action Center lists down a set of issue that is faced by these individuals. Facing the above issues many of the prisoners end up being homeless and spend way longer time on streets.\r\nNeed:\r\nThere is a need for a system that could give information and possible options to these individuals on further steps. These include but not limited to:\r\n\u2022\tImmediate transitional temporary accommodation to stay overnight after the prison release in case no alternative accommodation is available.\r\n\u2022\tAvailability of counselors helping on further legal help in keeping up with payroll and job readiness and employment etc.\r\n\u2022\tProving a list of organizations/non-profits and respective contact points that could provide the further help needed in extended accommodation, training for job readiness and employment.\r\nInitial proposal:\r\n\u2022\tAn online wiki page providing information of transitional accommodations, list of organizations involved providing job readiness and employment services.\r\n\u2022\tA process in place to be implemented at the prison to give initial briefing and reference to the above wiki page.\r\nConclusion:\r\nA person after serving in the prison to complete the punishment for a crime should be entitled to come back to the society to live an independent and normal life. Many times imprisonment leads to impact a person\u2019s life much more than the years served. It\u2019s just not just the social taboo, but people face a lot of legal restrictions to live a normal life again and end up in situations of misery like homelessness.\r\nA lot of effort from the city of Houston, local non-profits, and religious organizations goes into supporting the homeless population. Why there is almost no effort or focus been given to stop one of the major sources of the homelessness? There needs to be a process in place to fill this gap, the Project TLAP is aimed towards it.\r\n"
