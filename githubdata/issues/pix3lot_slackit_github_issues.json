Currently using Revit Server 2017. \r\n\r\nThe RVT files were all on a local file server and Slackit worked fine. When saved to Revit Server 2017, the BIM Coordinator who uploaded the files can still use Slackit and see their activity reported. When most others on the team sync, nothing is reported. Two users could still get their sync data to show up, but after one of them tested on a local file (which worked) and then went back to the Revit Server file, it stopped working for them as well.\r\n\r\nWe've tested multiple Revit files on several different Revit servers. Wondering if there's something specific to Revit Server that might be causing the issue."
