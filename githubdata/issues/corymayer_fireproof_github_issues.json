Know that you were working on fireproof for a hackathon so not sure if you have plans to continue on it, but if you are looking to deploy it to production, I wanted show you Fritz. As full disclosure, I'm a lead engineer at this company which helps to optimize and deploy models on mobile. I took the liberty to pull down your project and add the sdk. Here's just a bit of what insight I got from your models running on the edge.\r\n\r\n![fireproof-vid](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31963796/35872307-79db8b6e-0b34-11e8-97ca-b6a3512f4fc7.gif)\r\n\r\nDoes this seem like something you'd use for this project or any other ones you're working on that uses Core ML? I added placeholders for the keys but if you'd like an account, you can signup at https://app.fritz.ai/early-access and I'd be happy to grant you access. "
