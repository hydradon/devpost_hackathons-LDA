A Django model admin displaying inline related models, where the user has view-only permissions to a parent model but edit permissions to the inline model, would be presented with an editing UI, allowing POST requests, for updating the inline model. Directly editing the view-only parent model was not possible, but the parent model's save() method was called, triggering potential side effects, and causing pre and post-save signal handlers to be invoked. (To resolve this, the Django admin is adjusted to require edit permissions on the parent model in order for inline models to be editable.)</p>\n<p>Affected versions: &gt;= 2.1.0, &lt; 2.1.15</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/django/django/commit/3baf68b4efc660ff68fd246d2f7092bfd42a7a4a\"><code>3baf68b</code></a> [2.1.x] Bumped version for 2.1.5 release.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/django/django/commit/2fc998e3ba4ac8bfd7a77e616d1ce10b10f00450\"><code>2fc998e</code></a> [2.1.x] Added release date for 2.1.15.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/django/django/commit/103ebe2b5ff1b2614b85a52c239f471904d26244\"><code>103ebe2</code></a> Fixed CVE-2019-19118 -- Required edit permissions on parent model for editabl...</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/django/django/commit/f57f81a7fe9da5116a9892d7f32aa055771b99c0\"><code>f57f81a</code></a> [2.1.x] Refs <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/django/django/issues/30953\">#30953</a> -- Added 2.1.15 release note for 0107e3d1058f653f66032f7f...</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/django/django/commit/015fab76ad7f91562d2323657a6b5d7b4ff15e28\"><code>015fab7</code></a> [2.1.x] Fixed <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/django/django/issues/30953\">#30953</a> -- Made select_for_update() lock queryset's model when u...</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/django/django/commit/ed50f6c424fefea57c0b394d989c70a821998602\"><code>ed50f6c</code></a> [2.1.x] Made versionadded/versionchanged annotations without a content end wi...</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/django/django/commit/0423ea1fa8f263f22a949c81613cda4dbd39d927\"><code>0423ea1</code></a> [2.1.x] Added stub release notes for 2.1.15.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/django/django/commit/cfc0378224006e8c63e6addda2b4d4a24d693883\"><code>cfc0378</code></a> [2.1.x] Post-release version bump.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/django/django/commit/11f29b6e17cbecb87c291a747d6389c3fa754bf5\"><code>11f29b6</code></a> [2.1.x] Bumped version for 2.1.14 release.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/django/django/commit/341b2aa65853034628f7c845cf1720e49be3bea0\"><code>341b2aa</code></a> [2.1.x] Added release dates for 2.1.14 and 1.11.26.</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/django/django/compare/2.1.11...2.1.15\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://api.dependabot.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=django&package-manager=pip&previous-version=2.1.11&new-version=2.1.15)](https://dependabot.com/compatibility-score.html?dependency-name=django&package-manager=pip&previous-version=2.1.11&new-version=2.1.15)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.
