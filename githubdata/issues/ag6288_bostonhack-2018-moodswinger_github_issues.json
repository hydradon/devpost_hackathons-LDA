        "body": "Few of the problems were\r\n1. Not specifying a port. Flask chooses 5000 on run by default. Cloud foundry has a env variable to do that\r\n2. Requirements.txt not having all the dependencies. Things like numpy and urllib are available to your python env but not to cloudfoundry. For future rule of thumb use virtual env, that way you dont pollute your python environment. \r\n3. I added a Procfile that sends a command python server.py. Not sure if that was 100% necessary. but its working so not bothering with it.\r\n4. added a runtime.txt that defines the python version\r\n5. added buildpack to manifest.yml to select python. I think it was doing that automatically but just made it easier for cf\r\n6. Changed some version of the botcore, doubt that has to do anything though. I was just tackling the error messages.\r\n7. Oh and finally added a gitignore. like one should."
