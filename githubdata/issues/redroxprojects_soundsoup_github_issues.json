I routed the audio path through a gain node and used that to do the on/off switching instead of connecting and disconnecting. Also, I got rid of the frequency table to make it a little easier to compute the gain value.\r\n\r\nThere was a bug on Android which caused the context menu to open when the button is held so I disabled that. I'm quite new to web dev and GitHub so please do let me know if I screwed anything up.\r\n\r\nThanks for starting this project, can't say this enough, it's awesome! I'm going to try incorporating it into a performance soon which I'm really excited about."
