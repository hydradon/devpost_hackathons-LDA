Couldn't find your email, so I've got to use a \"workaround\".\r\n\r\nI appreciate you for sharing the code (especially `crypto-arbitrage`, which saved me some time from writing my own) and noticed your interest in mining data from various services.\r\nSo I'm willing to give something you could find useful (a python code for getting Youtube WL lists, forbidden by the official API): https://pastebin.com/1SNSEUWL\r\n\r\nYou can reach me via oguretsagressive at gmail if you wish."
