[Lodash](https://lodash.com/) became the [most depended on](https://gist.github.com/anvaka/8e8fa57c7ee1350e3491#file-01-most-dependent-upon-md) npm package, passed [1 billion](http://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=&author=jdalton) downloads, & its v3 release saw massive adoption!\n> \n> The year was also one of collaboration, as discussions began on [merging Lodash & Underscore](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/underdash/underdash/issues/14). Much of Lodash v4 is proofing out the ideas from those discussions. Lodash v4 **would not be possible** without the collaboration & contributions of the Underscore core team. In the spirit of merging our teams have blended with [several members](https://github.com/orgs/lodash/people) contributing to both libraries.\n> \n> For 2016 & [lodash v4.0.0](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/Changelog#v400) we wanted to cut loose, push forward, & take things up a notch!\n> \n> ## Modern only\n> \n> With v4 we\u2019re breaking free from [old projects](https://github.com/lodash-archive), old environments, & dropping [old IE < 9 support](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/End-of-IE-support)!\n> \n> ## 4 kB Core\n> \n> Lodash\u2019s kitchen-sink size will continue to grow as new methods & functionality are added. However, we now offer a 4 kB (gzipped) [core build](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/tree/4.0.0/dist) that\u2019s compatible with [Backbone v1.2.4](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jashkenas/backbone/issues/3839) for folks who want Lodash without lugging around the kitchen sink.\n> \n> ## More ES6\n> \n> We\u2019ve continued to embrace ES6 with methods like [_.isSymbol](https://lodash.com/docs#isSymbol), added support for cloning & comparing array buffers, maps, sets, & symbols, converting iterators to arrays, & iterable `_(\u2026)`.\n> \n> In addition, we\u2019ve published an [es-build](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/tree/4.0.0-es/) & pulled [babel-plugin-lodash](https://github.com/lodash/babel-plugin-lodash) into core to make tree-shaking a breeze.\n> \n> ## More Modular\n> \n> Pop quiz! \ud83d\udce3\n> \n> What category path does the `bindAll` method belong to? Is it \n> \n> A) `require('lodash/function/bindAll')`\n> B) `require('lodash/utility/bindAll')`\n> C) `require('lodash/util/bindAll')`\n> \n> Don\u2019t know? Well, with v4 it doesn\u2019t matter because now module paths are as simple as\n> \n> ``` js\n> var bindAll = require('lodash/bindAll');\n> ```\n> \n> We\u2019ve also reduced module complexity making it easier to create smaller bundles. This has helped Lodash adoption with libraries like [Async](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/caolan/async/pull/996) & [Redux](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rackt/redux/pull/611)!\n> \n> ## 1st Class FP\n> \n> With v3 we introduced [lodash-fp](https://github.com/lodash-archive/lodash-fp). We learned a lot & with v4 we decided to [pull it into core](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/FP-Guide).\n> \n> Now you can get immutable, auto-curried, iteratee-first, data-last methods as simply as\n> \n> ``` js\n> var _ = require('lodash/fp');\n> var object = { 'a': 1 };\n></tr></table> ...
