This closes \n> a leak that only half closed in versions 4.0.13 and 4.1.0, but it is a slight incompatibility.\n> \n> This kind of access is not the intended use of Handlebars and leads to the vulnerability described\n> in [#1495](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1495). We will **not** increase the major version, because such use is not intended or documented, \n> and because of the potential impact of the issue (we fear that most people won't use a new major version\n> and the issue may not be resolved on many systems). \n> \n> [Commits](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/compare/v4.1.1...v4.1.2)\n> \n> ## v4.1.1 - March 16th, 2019\n> Bugfixes:\n> - fix: add \"runtime.d.ts\" to allow \"require('handlebars/runtime')\" in TypeScript - 5cedd62\n> \n> Refactorings:\n> - replace \"async\" with \"neo-async\" - 048f2ce\n> - use \"substring\"-function instead of \"substr\" - 445ae12\n> \n> Compatibility notes:\n> - This is a bugfix release.
