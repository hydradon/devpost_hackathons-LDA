You should definitely change your webhook auth if your logs indicate attempted exploit.\r\n> \r\n> (If you are only sending email using an Anymail EmailBackend, and have not set up Anymail's event tracking webhooks, this issue does not affect you.)\r\n> \r\n> *More information*\r\n> \r\n> Anymail's webhook validation was vulnerable to a timing attack. A remote attacker could use this to obtain your WEBHOOK_AUTHORIZATION shared secret, potentially allowing them to post fabricated or malicious email tracking events to your app.\r\n> \r\n> There have not been any reports of attempted exploit. (The vulnerability was discovered through code review.) Attempts would be visible in HTTP logs as a very large number of 400 responses on Anymail's webhook urls (by default \"/anymail/*esp_name*/tracking/\"), and in Python error monitoring as a very large number of AnymailWebhookValidationFailure exceptions.\r\n> \n> ## v1.2\n> #### New features\r\n> \r\n> * **Postmark:** Support new click webhook in normalized tracking events\r\n> \n> ## v1.1\n> #### Bug fixes\r\n> \r\n> * **Mailgun:** Support metadata in opened/clicked/unsubscribed tracking webhooks, and fix potential problems if metadata keys collided with Mailgun event parameter names. (See [#76](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/anymail/django-anymail/issues/76), [#77](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/anymail/django-anymail/issues/77))\r\n> \r\n> #### Other changes\r\n> \r\n> * **Internal:** Rework Anymail's ParsedEmail class and rename to EmailAddress to align it with similar  functionality in the Python 3.6 email package, in preparation for future inbound support. ParsedEmail was not documented for use outside Anymail's internals (so this change does not bump the semver major version), but if you were using it in an undocumented way you will need to update your code.\n> \n> ## v1.0\n> It's official: Anymail is no longer \"pre-1.0.\" The API has been stable for many months, and there's no reason not to use Anymail in production.\r\n> \r\n> #### Breaking changes\r\n> \r\n> - There are no *new* breaking changes in the 1.0 release, but a breaking change introduced several months ago in v0.8 is now strictly enforced. If you still have an EMAIL_BACKEND setting that looks like \"anymail.backends.*espname*.*EspName*Backend\", you'll need to change it to just \"anymail.backends.*espname*.EmailBackend\". (Earlier versions had issued a DeprecationWarning. See the [v0.8 release notes](https://github.com/anymail/django-anymail/releases/tag/v0.8).)\r\n> \r\n> #### New features and other changes\r\n> \r\n> - Clean up and document Anymail's [Test EmailBackend](http://anymail.readthedocs.io/en/v1.0/tips/test_backend/)\r\n> - Add notes on [handling transient ESP errors](http://anymail.readthedocs.io/en/v1.0/tips/transient_errors/) and improving [batch send performance](http://anymail.readthedocs.io/en/v1.0/tips/performance/)\r\n> - **SendGrid:** handle Python 2 `long` integers in metadata and extra headers\r\n> \n> ## v1.0.rc0\n> #### Breaking changes\r\n> \r\n> - **All backends:** The old *EspName*Backend names that were deprecated in v0.8 have been removed. Attempting to use the old names will now fail, rather than issue a DeprecationWarning. See the [v0.8 release notes](https://github.com/anymail/django-anymail/releases/tag/v0.8).\r\n> \r\n> #### New features\r\n> \r\n></tr></table> ...

[#5922](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/encode/django-rest-framework/issues/5922)\r\n> * authtoken.views import coreapi from rest_framework.compat, not directly. [#5921](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/encode/django-rest-framework/issues/5921)\r\n> * Docs: Add missing argument 'detail' to Route [#5920](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/encode/django-rest-framework/issues/5920)\n> \n> ## Version 3.8.1\n> * Use old `url_name` behavior in route decorators [#5915](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/encode/django-rest-framework/issues/5915)\r\n> \r\n>     For `list_route` and `detail_route` maintain the old behavior of `url_name`,\r\n>     basing it on the `url_path` instead of the function name.\r\n> \r\n> \n> ## Version 3.8\n> * [Release Announcement](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/topics/3.8-announcement/)\r\n> * [3.8.0 Milestone](https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework/milestone/61?closed=1)\r\n> \r\n> * **Breaking Change**: Alter `read_only` plus `default` behaviour. [#5886](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/encode/django-rest-framework/issues/5886)\r\n> \r\n>     `read_only` fields will now **always** be excluded from writable fields.\r\n> \r\n>     Previously `read_only` fields with a `default` value would use the `default` for create and update operations.\r\n> \r\n>     In order to maintain the old behaviour you may need to pass the value of `read_only` fields when calling `save()` in\r\n>     the view:\r\n> \r\n>         def perform_create(self, serializer):\r\n>             serializer.save(owner=self.request.user)\r\n> \r\n>     Alternatively you may override `save()` or `create()` or `update()` on the serialiser as appropriate.\r\n> * Correct allow_null behaviour when required=False [#5888](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/encode/django-rest-framework/issues/5888)\r\n> \r\n>     Without an explicit `default`, `allow_null` implies a default of `null` for outgoing serialisation. Previously such\r\n>     fields were being skipped when read-only or otherwise not required.\r\n> \r\n>     **Possible backwards compatibility break** if you were relying on such fields being excluded from the outgoing\r\n>     representation. In order to restore the old behaviour you can override `data` to exclude the field when `None`.\r\n> \r\n></tr></table> ...
