It also includes a json configuration for BERT (en, cased) which is mostly the same as the configuration for rusentiment except for the max seq length and batch size (which I set to values such that I don't get out-of-memory on my hardware).\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes a fix for the `sets_accuracy` metric which should now correctly work for string labels (i.e. wrap them into sets instead converting them to sets). Also I added reporting of cached files in `download_decompress`.",

Added files for mltrack ranking:\r\n\r\n- reader `mltrack_reader.py` to read and to preprocess raw data\r\n\r\n- config file `mltrack_ranker.json` for model training\r\n\r\n- `ndcg.py` metric for scoring observed predictions\r\n\r\n- notebook `mltrack_submit.ipynb` to get submission file\r\n\r\n2. Bug in return_probas condition:\r\nIf `self.return_probas` is True, then error appears in the following line because `pred` dimensionality in this case is equal to 1. Moreover, `predictions` is a vector containing probabilities of the last class which doesn't make sense in case of non-binary classification.\r\nhttps://github.com/deepmipt/DeepPavlov/blob/0214bd4ca2a676057d287a5011a20fb7ee2ddaeb/deeppavlov/models/bert/bert_ranker.py#L101",
