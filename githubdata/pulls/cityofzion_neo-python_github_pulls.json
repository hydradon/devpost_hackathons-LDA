Generally when searching, the goal is trying to locate a specific scripthash rather than dump every contract's lengthy script in hex.\r\n\r\n**How did you solve this problem?**\r\n\r\nBy hiding the contract script output in the search results. `show contract` can still be used to acquire the script hex of a contract, so no functionality is lost.\r\n\r\n**How did you make sure your solution works?**\r\n\r\nManual testing.\r\n\r\n**Are there any special changes in the code that we should be aware of?**\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n**Please check the following, if applicable:**\r\n\r\n- [ ] Did you add any tests?\r\n- [X] Did you run `make lint`?\r\n- [X] Did you run `make test`?\r\n- [X] Are you making a PR to a feature branch or development rather than master?\r\n- [X] Did you add an entry to `CHANGELOG.rst`?

This is because the `--i` flag used the `gather_params` helper function and the regular command line parsing did not.\r\n\r\n**How did you solve this problem?**\r\nI split out the parameter verification into a separate function: `verify_params` and added a `user_entry` flag to limit verification to user entered params.\r\n- verifies parameters input via command line and --i flag\r\n- ensures parameter input is identical\r\n- does not disrupt existing logic which had previously caused many errors in #972\r\n\r\n**How did you make sure your solution works?**\r\nmanual testing\r\n\r\n**Are there any special changes in the code that we should be aware of?**\r\nYes, new parameter parsing affected some gas costs and one return value from previous tests. See https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-python/pull/973/commits/efb6ef47887237822d8ad1c844b3a794255bcece\r\n I think these are good changes seeing as they mirror the results if the `--i` flag was used.\r\n\r\n**Please check the following, if applicable:**\r\n\r\n- [x] Did you add any tests?\r\n- [x] Did you run `make lint`?\r\n- [x] Did you run `make test`?\r\n- [x] Are you making a PR to a feature branch or development rather than master?\r\n- [x] Did you add an entry to `CHANGELOG.rst`?
