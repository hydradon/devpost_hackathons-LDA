[Read the announcement on our blog.](https://www.palletsprojects.com/blog/flask-1-0-released/\r\n> \r\n> There are over a year's worth of changes in this release. Many features have been improved or changed. [Read the changelog](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/changelog/) to understand how your project's code will be affected.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> JSON Security Fix\r\n> ------------------\r\n> \r\n> Flask previously decoded incoming JSON bytes using the content type of the request. Although JSON should only be encoded as UTF-8, Flask was more lenient. However, Python includes non-text related encodings that could result in unexpected memory use by a request.\r\n> \r\n> Flask will now detect the encoding of incoming JSON data as one of the supported UTF encodings, and will not allow arbitrary encodings from the request.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> Install or Upgrade\r\n> -------------------\r\n> \r\n> Install from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/) with pip:\r\n> \r\n>     pip install -U Flask\n> \n> ## 0.12.4\n> This is a repackage of [0.12.3](https://github.com/pallets/flask/releases/0.12.3) to fix an issue with how the package was built.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> Upgrade\r\n> --------\r\n> \r\n> Upgrade from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/0.12.4/) with pip. Use a version identifier if you want to stay at 0.12:\r\n> \r\n>     pip install -U 'Flask~=0.12.4'\r\n> \n> ## 0.12.3\n> This release includes an important security fix for JSON and a minor backport for CLI support in PyCharm. It is provided for projects that cannot update to Flask 1.0 immediately. See the [1.0 announcement](https://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/flask-1-0-released) and update to it instead if possible.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> JSON Security Fix\r\n> ------------------\r\n> \r\n> Flask previously decoded incoming JSON bytes using the content type of the request.

This avoids some behavior that was confusing\n>     to debug.\n> -   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to\n>     ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by\n>     default, and an indented format in debug mode. :pr:`2193`\n> -   :meth:`Flask.__init__ <Flask>` accepts the ``host_matching``\n>     argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. :issue:`1559`\n> -   :meth:`Flask.__init__ <Flask>` accepts the ``static_host`` argument\n>     and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static\n>     route. :issue:`1559`\n> -   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.\n>     :pr:`2223`\n> -   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to\n>     :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. :pr:`2017`\n> -   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the\n>     ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the\n>     ``OPTIONS`` method. :pr:`1489`\n> -   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from\n>     base classes. :pr:`1936`\n> -   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the\n>     request are handled by the app's error handlers. :pr:`2254`\n> -   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and\n>     :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app's\n>     encoder and decoder. :pr:`1898`\n> -   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of\n>     ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been\n>     improved to describe why the type is invalid. :pr:`2256`\n> -   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the\n>     application. :pr:`2259`\n> -   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP\n>     address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as\n>     Chrome. :pr:`2282`\n> -   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. :pr:`2282`\n> -   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through\n>     ``SERVER_NAME``. :pr:`2282`\n> -   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or\n>     ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. :pr:`2297`\n> -   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``\n>     parameter to work with the ``flask`` command.
