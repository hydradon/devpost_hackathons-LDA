Through these anonymous geo-tagged posts, users can not only help other users navigate their cities safely but also provide data for NPOs and police enforcement to take future meaningful action. Besides a social network between users, we will visualize the data real-time and ideally create an API (future feature) to serve as tools for NPOs/police enforcement/etc  to use.",

Through these anonymous geo-tagged posts, users can not only help other users navigate their cities safely but also provide data for NPOs and police enforcement to take future meaningful action. Besides a social network between users, we will visualize the data real-time and ideally create an API (future feature) to serve as tools for NPOs/police enforcement/etc  to use.",
