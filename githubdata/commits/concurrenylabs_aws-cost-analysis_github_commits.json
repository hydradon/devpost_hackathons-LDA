Updated relevant parts of the code to reflect this.\n- Due to known limitations in SAM, where conditions are not recognized, I had to split the\n  SAM templates, so now there is a separate one for executions triggered by an S3 event (curprocessor-sam.yml),\n  and another one for cross-account executions (curprocessor-xacct-sam.yml). There is a bit of duplication\n  as a result of having two SAM templates, but otherwise there are many issues in trying to\n  make both scenarios work in the same template.\n- Updated README file, to reflect some of the changes.\n- Added an extra validation to the S3 starter function, since AWS places two different Manifest.json files\n  each time there is a new Cost and Usage report. This would result in two Step Function executions,\n  unnecessarily, without the added validation.",
