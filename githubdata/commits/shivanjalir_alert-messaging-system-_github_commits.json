            "message": "Alert Person as per Geographical System\n\nMost of the time it happened with me that I forget to finish my work\neven though I was in same area. Suppose I want to purchase food items\nand I just crossed supermarket. When I reached at home then I came to\nknow that I forgot to purchase food items and I was there in the same\narea. In such case if I get any alert message when I am in that same\narea then I can finish my work at proper time and do not worry about\nwill I forget to do that stuff.\nSend alert message to person to do some stuff from daily list if that\nperson in that area near to bank, supermarket , registration office etc\nIt's my habit to create a list of activities on the daily basis I want\nto finish within a day. If I successfully finished that activity then I\nchecked that list otherwise I use to carry forward that activity for\nnext day. Same as that I have created listview in Android and have\ncreated the form which will add activities in the list. If I finished\nsame activity the I just want to press Done button then it will remove\nthat activity from the list. At the same time , I am trying to track\ngeographical position. As of now I have tracked Longitude and Latitude\nusing google map API. I am using Twilio for sending alter SMS which is\nsuccessfully completed.\nRight now I am doing some part of work in IntelliJ\nI think everyone face this situation most of the time and I am trying to\nhelp people to solve their problem which they face on daily basis\nTwilio , Volley API , JSON Objects, Intellij , Google API\nWhile adding list application should predict which activity the person\nhas to complete and as per the current geographical location which store\nnear address mostly near to home using google map.",
