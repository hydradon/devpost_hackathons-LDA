This is done in both the compiled template and the \"lookup\"-helper. \n>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been\n>   published recently.\n> \n> Compatibility notes: \n> \n> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using\n>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return \n>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.\n> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:\n> \n> ```js\n> {\n>   __proto__: 'some string'\n> }\n> ```\n> \n> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only \n>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases\n>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing\n>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.\n> \n> \n> \n> [Commits](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/compare/v4.5.2...v4.5.3)\n> \n> ## v4.5.2 - November 13th, 2019\n> # Bugfixes\n> \n> - fix: use String(field) in lookup when checking for \"constructor\" - d541378\n> - test: add fluent API for testing Handlebars - c2ac79c\n> \n> Compatibility notes:\n> - no incompatibility are to be expected\n></tr></table> ...

I loved the work you have put on this, it is the emoji component that has the best performance in RN community.\r\n\r\nI was building a composer which is under a page with content, so it only pops up when user want to write a comment, and I put the emoji component under the composer, so by pressing a button user can have keyboards down and selecting the emojis. \r\n\r\nOne of the problem that I find is that the performance really suffers,like the whole page freeze for 3-5 seconds even on the latest Android phone,  when navigating to a new page with such setup, and by digging in I find the emoji component takes too long to load and block the entire JS thread. By reading the code and change the renderAheadOffset={1500} to renderAheadOffset={200} or any smaller number this problem solved. I think it might be a better idea to pass the renderAheadOffset as a prop instead of fix it inside the code, cause it is very much performance-related.\r\n\r\nThanks Sujay! Really an amazing emoji component, saved me tons of time, I owe you a beer!"

This object is kept in _EmojiSearch.js_ to separate it from _EmojiInput.js_\r\n- The more popularly used search engine [Fuse.js](https://github.com/krisk/fuse) replaced [Wade](https://github.com/kbrsh/wade). Changed _emojiSynonym.json_ and _compiled.js_ JSON format to reduce redundancy/space and allow Fuse.js to search through them.\r\n- Fuzzy search can be enabled by increasing the `threshold` in the `fuseOptions` object. Currently, fuzzy search is disabled by default (set to `0.0`), so it behaves as usual.\r\n- When users are making a search query, the first few characters they input may result in many many matches. (The additions to the synonyms dictionary has contributed to more search results.) So, I feel like it is nice to only the **top 50 most relevant results** so that the user's hardware does not have to render too many emoji and would be able to quickly display queries.\r\n\r\n- ~~(Side note) My code editor automatically prettifies javascript files, so the git diffs may look like I changed a lot but I really haven't.~~ Indentations changed to spaces"

            "body": "- Included _emojiSynonyms.json_ to extend searchable keywords (it was imported but never used or implemented)\r\n- 205 new keywords have been added to _emojiSynonyms.json_\r\n- EmojiSearchSpace object is what is used to search for emoji. This object is kept in _EmojiSearch.js_ to separate it from _EmojiInput.js_\r\n- The more popularly used search engine [Fuse.js](https://github.com/krisk/fuse) replaced [Wade](https://github.com/kbrsh/wade). Changed _emojiSynonym.json_ and _compiled.js_ JSON format to reduce redundancy/space and allow Fuse.js to search through them.\r\n- Fuzzy search can be enabled by increasing the `threshold` in the `fuseOptions` object. Currently, fuzzy search is disabled by default (set to `0.0`), so it behaves as usual.\r\n- When users are making a search query, the first few characters they input may result in many many matches. (The additions to the synonyms dictionary has contributed to more search results.) So, I feel like it is nice to only the **top 50 most relevant results** so that the user's hardware does not have to render too many emoji and would be able to quickly display queries.\r\n\r\n- ~~(Side note) My code editor automatically prettifies javascript files, so the git diffs may look like I changed a lot but I really haven't.~~ Indentations changed to spaces"

            "body": "First of all, great emoji component!!! I loved the work you have put on this, it is the emoji component that has the best performance in RN community.\r\n\r\nI was building a composer which is under a page with content, so it only pops up when user want to write a comment, and I put the emoji component under the composer, so by pressing a button user can have keyboards down and selecting the emojis. \r\n\r\nOne of the problem that I find is that the performance really suffers,like the whole page freeze for 3-5 seconds even on the latest Android phone,  when navigating to a new page with such setup, and by digging in I find the emoji component takes too long to load and block the entire JS thread. By reading the code and change the renderAheadOffset={1500} to renderAheadOffset={200} or any smaller number this problem solved. I think it might be a better idea to pass the renderAheadOffset as a prop instead of fix it inside the code, cause it is very much performance-related.\r\n\r\nThanks Sujay! Really an amazing emoji component, saved me tons of time, I owe you a beer!"
