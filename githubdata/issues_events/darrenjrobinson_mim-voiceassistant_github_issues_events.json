And because you're new to GitPitch I also wanted to give you a little feedback on some ways you can simplify and improve your approach to building this presentation. And because GitPitch is a *git-native* presentation tool the best way for me to do that is to create this PR :) \r\n\r\nBefore you dig into the details you can open and view my version of your presentation [right here](https://gitpitch.com/gitpitch/MIM-VoiceAssistant/presentation#/16). This is another great thing about GitPitch, all forks/branches/versions of a presentation can be viewed live.\r\n\r\nHere is a brief summary of the changes I have made on this PR:\r\n\r\n1. The PITCHME.md markdown syntax has been simplified. On numerous slides you were using a series of nested markdown shortcuts and applying those shortcuts line-by-line on paragraphs of text. This PR shows you how you can apply a single CSS style to an entire block of text, making your presentation markdown a whole lot cleaner and easier to maintain. See how the  *commentary* CSS classes have been used for further details.\r\n1. As snap-layouts are used on almost every slide within this presentation I have disabled transitions globally in the PITCHME.yaml settings per [the recommendation](https://gitpitch.com/docs/layout-features/snap-layout-slide-transitions/) in the GitPitch docs. I think this also improves the viewer experience when you are showing the series of slides displaying the architecture diagram. Less distracting activity when transitioning between these slides.\r\n1. I used a small bit of CSS to create a little more space between the bullet points on your slides which makes them a little nicer. This is a small subtle change, not required by any means.\r\n1. The logo size has been slightly adjusted to make it a little more legible for old eyes (like mine). \r\n1. All image assets have been size optimized using tinypng.com for viewing and sharing on the web per [the recommendation](https://gitpitch.com/docs/image-features/background/) in the GitPitch docs. This step shaved over 4Mb off the image files used for this presentation, that's a 66% saving and it translates into improved loading and viewing times for your audience.\r\n\r\nThat's it. I hope you find some of this feedback useful. Completely up to you whether you want to accept and merge the PR itself. I just think it's a great way to share knowledge. Cheers, David."

            "body": "Hi Darren,\r\n\r\nI've just been looking over your presentation - very cool subject and slideshow. And seriously good job for a first time GitPitch user. And because you're new to GitPitch I also wanted to give you a little feedback on some ways you can simplify and improve your approach to building this presentation. And because GitPitch is a *git-native* presentation tool the best way for me to do that is to create this PR :) \r\n\r\nBefore you dig into the details you can open and view my version of your presentation [right here](https://gitpitch.com/gitpitch/MIM-VoiceAssistant/presentation#/16). This is another great thing about GitPitch, all forks/branches/versions of a presentation can be viewed live.\r\n\r\nHere is a brief summary of the changes I have made on this PR:\r\n\r\n1. The PITCHME.md markdown syntax has been simplified. On numerous slides you were using a series of nested markdown shortcuts and applying those shortcuts line-by-line on paragraphs of text. This PR shows you how you can apply a single CSS style to an entire block of text, making your presentation markdown a whole lot cleaner and easier to maintain. See how the  *commentary* CSS classes have been used for further details.\r\n1. As snap-layouts are used on almost every slide within this presentation I have disabled transitions globally in the PITCHME.yaml settings per [the recommendation](https://gitpitch.com/docs/layout-features/snap-layout-slide-transitions/) in the GitPitch docs. I think this also improves the viewer experience when you are showing the series of slides displaying the architecture diagram. Less distracting activity when transitioning between these slides.\r\n1. I used a small bit of CSS to create a little more space between the bullet points on your slides which makes them a little nicer. This is a small subtle change, not required by any means.\r\n1. The logo size has been slightly adjusted to make it a little more legible for old eyes (like mine). \r\n1. All image assets have been size optimized using tinypng.com for viewing and sharing on the web per [the recommendation](https://gitpitch.com/docs/image-features/background/) in the GitPitch docs. This step shaved over 4Mb off the image files used for this presentation, that's a 66% saving and it translates into improved loading and viewing times for your audience.\r\n\r\nThat's it. I hope you find some of this feedback useful. Completely up to you whether you want to accept and merge the PR itself. I just think it's a great way to share knowledge. Cheers, David."
