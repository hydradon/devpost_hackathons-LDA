I'm also currently working on a lot of ML stuff and the company I work at is looking to hire co-op students for the Jan 2018, and May 2018. I was wondering if any of you are interested to do an internship with us.\r\n\r\nA bit of background, our product is essentially a suite of APIs for distributed training, optimization, and deployment of deep learning neural networks. You can check it out at https://terrene.co\r\n\r\nLet me know if this is something that interests you."
