The format of the binary file is provided below.\r\n\r\nThis code will not be production level code, so don't spend any time make it pretty or adding options. Once the performance is understood it will be incorporated into the much larger project and mostly re-written.\r\n\r\nThe performance test will be simple -- we will just run each of the 'go', 'rust' and 'c++' versions against the same folder (with maybe 1000 copies of the data file) using 'time':\r\n\r\n  >  time rust_scanner\r\n  >  time go_scanner\r\n  >  time cpp_scanner\r\n\r\nThere's no need for elaborate options parsing, although the folder name can be a command line option.\r\n\r\nThe C++ and Go versions are already written and can be found in ./src/other/parallel/cpp in the develop branch.  The Go version needs to be updated to read the binary file. Add the rust versions in the same folder.\r\n\r\nMake a PR to the repo when you're ready.\r\n\r\n**Here's the file format definition:**\r\n\r\n[TrueBlocks Index Digests - File Format.pdf](https://github.com/Great-Hill-Corporation/trueblocks-core/files/4150273/TrueBlocks.Index.Digests.-.File.Format.pdf)\r\n"

The trouble is that we then refer to the files in the code based on their location depending on the end user having specified a different location for the cache:\n\nThings to do:\n\n1) Find all the files that get copied into $(HOME)/.quickBlocks on running `cmake ../src` if any\n2) Find all the files that get copied with `make install` if any\n3) Distinguish between files that are needed for proper operation of QBlocks (quickBlocks.toml, names.txt, 0xTokenLib, etc.)\n4) Improve the copying/install process so that these files are always present in the $(HOME)/.quickBlocks folder\n5) Find all uses of these files in the code and change them so they always look in ~/.quickBlocks ignoring the customized cache location (do this so we can confidently tell the end user they can delete their cache at any time with no loss of function)\n6) Decide if copying config files to the local folder is the best way to do these things as opposed to say writing code on initialization of the libraries checks for the existence of the required file and creates is if not found\n7) Make this versionable, so if a user later re-installs (or re-builds after a pull), we have a way to rebuild the data in the new format if there is one.\n\nItem (7) argues for item (6)."

These are copied to $(HOME)/.quickBlocks on installation (at least I think they are, but this may not be consistent). The trouble is that we then refer to the files in the code based on their location depending on the end user having specified a different location for the cache:\n\nThings to do:\n\n1) Find all the files that get copied into $(HOME)/.quickBlocks on running `cmake ../src` if any\n2) Find all the files that get copied with `make install` if any\n3) Distinguish between files that are needed for proper operation of QBlocks (quickBlocks.toml, names.txt, 0xTokenLib, etc.)\n4) Improve the copying/install process so that these files are always present in the $(HOME)/.quickBlocks folder\n5) Find all uses of these files in the code and change them so they always look in ~/.quickBlocks ignoring the customized cache location (do this so we can confidently tell the end user they can delete their cache at any time with no loss of function)\n6) Decide if copying config files to the local folder is the best way to do these things as opposed to say writing code on initialization of the libraries checks for the existence of the required file and creates is if not found\n7) Make this versionable, so if a user later re-installs (or re-builds after a pull), we have a way to rebuild the data in the new format if there is one.\n\nItem (7) argues for item (6)."

These are copied to $(HOME)/.quickBlocks on installation (at least I think they are, but this may not be consistent). The trouble is that we then refer to the files in the code based on their location depending on the end user having specified a different location for the cache:\n\nThings to do:\n\n1) Find all the files that get copied into $(HOME)/.quickBlocks on running `cmake ../src` if any\n2) Find all the files that get copied with `make install` if any\n3) Distinguish between files that are needed for proper operation of QBlocks (quickBlocks.toml, names.txt, 0xTokenLib, etc.)\n4) Improve the copying/install process so that these files are always present in the $(HOME)/.quickBlocks folder\n5) Find all uses of these files in the code and change them so they always look in ~/.quickBlocks ignoring the customized cache location (do this so we can confidently tell the end user they can delete their cache at any time with no loss of function)\n6) Decide if copying config files to the local folder is the best way to do these things as opposed to say writing code on initialization of the libraries checks for the existence of the required file and creates is if not found\n7) Make this versionable, so if a user later re-installs (or re-builds after a pull), we have a way to rebuild the data in the new format if there is one.\n\nItem (7) argues for item (6)."

This includes two functions (`promoteToFunction` and `promoteToEvent`) which take a generic (un-articulated) transaction and returns a `promoted` transaction (or event) which contains populated values for the function. For example, the Solidity function `vote(uint proposalID, bool stance)` would generate a C++ class called `CVote` would have `proposalID` and `stance` as fields.\r\n\r\nThis capability would make writing code that analyzes smart contracts off-chain much easier. For example, `ether_delta` is a static library could allow you to write custom code on the `ether_delta` contract or use with any token that trades on EtherDelta. This is a very powerful and very useful feature, and it's easy to forget about, thus this reminder.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The text in the line is commented out because of a change I made as part of making articulation more generic. Part of that work included commenting out all such lines in both tokenlib.cpp and walletlib.cpp since I no longer needed to articulate things in this way.\r\n\r\n**Issue:** can we totally remove walletlib and tokenlib and have both of them fully driven by a JSON abi file? I think the articulation in getTrans already works that way (in other words, it works without the tokenlib and walletlib lbraries). If that's right (it is), does it mean that tokenlib and walletlib are no longer needed (I think it does).\r\n\r\n**One caveat:** The only place where tokenlib and walletlib may be useful is for building actual classes out of the functions of the ABI which might be useful for IoT or customized monitors as per the way I used to do things prior to 0.6.0 \r\n"

Monitoring code is used to articulate the data.\r\n\r\nSearch for this code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (!func.name.empty())\r\n    functions[functions.getCount()] = func;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf one removes this code, a new function name will appear in some of the `grabABI` tests, but they are not correct.\r\n\r\nAlso--for the `DAO` and `ENS` contracts, as an example, we force the correct behavior in the `promoteTransaction` function.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to handle this since each smart contract's constructors and fallbacks are different.\r\n\r\n**Notes:**\r\nThe ABI file does not include the name of the smart contract (not the interface for its constructor). This makes it impossible to parse the input to the constructor. It also makes it necessary to 'name' the contract externally. If the ABI included the name of the smart contract, automated auditing code could use that name to better process the activity on the contract. This may be an idea for an Ethereum EIP. Automated auditing tools want to be able to read the ABI and fully articulate all interactions with that contract.\r\n\r\nThe downsides of this approach would be that the names of contracts are not unique, but that can be handled by the end-user, it should not be decided by the person who wrote the code that generated the ABI. The system should allow the user to make a decision about how to use it.\r\n"
