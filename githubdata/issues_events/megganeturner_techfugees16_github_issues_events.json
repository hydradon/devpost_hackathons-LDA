            "body": "Despite this branch being called 'buttons', the biggest changes I've made have been to the structure of `app/assets/stylesheets/` - all files are now .scss by default rather than .css, as Sass is far more powerful and allows us to do a whole host of things that CSS can't, and since it is just a pre-processor it doesn't really change anything.\r\n\r\nI've also added a new directory `/partials/` which we can use to organise our CSS so that it is modular and easy to manage. At first I thought I needed to make some minor changes to the pipeline to make this work but it looks like that's not the case - as `application.scss` requires the whole tree it seems to work just fine.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure whether you'd make a similar choice anyway (sorry if I'm just stating the obvious!!), but the reasoning behind this is so that we can attack one piece of the puzzle at a time on a whole app level, instead of hard coding hacky solutions into specific areas. Now `_buttons.scss` is the one place to make changes to buttons across the whole app. Next up I'd like to normalize the typography and introduce a proper colour palette - each of these can be addressed through partials rather than one main stylesheet that gets more and more unruly as time goes on. It will help keep our design consistent and manageable.\r\n\r\nAs for the buttons themselves - nothing amazing! Just added some different classes of buttons - green for CTAs, red for danger/warnings, a standard grey, and a disabled option as well as hover and active states for all of them. I'm not suggesting that these are final. I want to take some time and sort out a proper colour palette with primary and accent colours and play around with a few things. I'm not stoked with how they look at the moment but I just wanted to get the basic styling bedrock in there so we can change it later!\r\n\r\nInterested to hear what you think about this!
