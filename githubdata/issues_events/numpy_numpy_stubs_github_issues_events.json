I don't know if this is the right place to post or ask about this, but I want to ultimately contribute directly to numpy, python, and mypy and this seemed like an appropriate place. Specifically, I want to extend this project and be able to reject statically\r\n```python\r\nx = np.zeros((1, 2))\r\nx @ x\r\n```\r\nand accept\r\n```python\r\nx @ x.T\r\n```\r\nWould this be the right place to discuss syntax, necessary work, and other things required to make this a reality?"
