This is done in both the compiled template and the \"lookup\"-helper. \n>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been\n>   published recently.\n> \n> Compatibility notes: \n> \n> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using\n>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return \n>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.\n> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:\n> \n> ```js\n> {\n>   __proto__: 'some string'\n> }\n> ```\n> \n> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only \n>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases\n>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing\n>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.\n> \n> \n> \n> [Commits](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/compare/v4.5.2...v4.5.3)\n> \n> ## v4.5.2 - November 13th, 2019\n> # Bugfixes\n> \n> - fix: use String(field) in lookup when checking for \"constructor\" - d541378\n> - test: add fluent API for testing Handlebars - c2ac79c\n> \n> Compatibility notes:\n> - no incompatibility are to be expected\n></tr></table> ...

This closes \n> a leak that only half closed in versions 4.0.13 and 4.1.0, but it is a slight incompatibility.\n> \n> This kind of access is not the intended use of Handlebars and leads to the vulnerability described\n> in [#1495](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1495). We will **not** increase the major version, because such use is not intended or documented, \n> and because of the potential impact of the issue (we fear that most people won't use a new major version\n> and the issue may not be resolved on many systems). \n> \n> [Commits](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/compare/v4.1.1...v4.1.2)\n> \n> ## v4.1.1 - March 16th, 2019\n> Bugfixes:\n> - fix: add \"runtime.d.ts\" to allow \"require('handlebars/runtime')\" in TypeScript - 5cedd62\n> \n> Refactorings:\n> - replace \"async\" with \"neo-async\" - 048f2ce\n> - use \"substring\"-function instead of \"substr\" - 445ae12\n> \n> Compatibility notes:\n> - This is a bugfix release.
