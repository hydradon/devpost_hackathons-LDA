We should probably have an [onInstalled](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/runtime#event-onInstalled) page pop up like some extensions, with some README-like information on how to use the extension and maybe direct the user to options (KeepTabs doesn't do that much until you've added some hotkeys).\r\n2. We also need to consider how to make the extension work a) immediately upon install and b) after an update. I think the way b) works is the browser auto-updates when the extension isn't running; i.e. in our case when the browser is fully closed. That's okay-ish, although many users probably never fully close Chrome and might instead try manually updating/reloading -- which would break KT functionality until they reload their tabs, as we've always dealt with in development. a) also needs thought, because tabs currently open when the user installs KT will not have the content script, and so won't have KT active on them. I think there's a way to inject the content script into those pages for a seamless experience. Both these items can be explained away in the onInstalled page, but of course it's better to have it be automatic and seamless for the user."

We should probably have an [onInstalled](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/runtime#event-onInstalled) page pop up like some extensions, with some README-like information on how to use the extension and maybe direct the user to options (KeepTabs doesn't do that much until you've added some hotkeys).\r\n2. We also need to consider how to make the extension work a) immediately upon install and b) after an update. I think the way b) works is the browser auto-updates when the extension isn't running; i.e. in our case when the browser is fully closed. That's okay-ish, although many users probably never fully close Chrome and might instead try manually updating/reloading -- which would break KT functionality until they reload their tabs, as we've always dealt with in development. a) also needs thought, because tabs currently open when the user installs KT will not have the content script, and so won't have KT active on them. I think there's a way to inject the content script into those pages for a seamless experience. Both these items can be explained away in the onInstalled page, but of course it's better to have it be automatic and seamless for the user."

But for some reason, the UI (hold key indicator and tab search) does not show when you activate hold keys while focused within the editing window. As before, everything works normally if you click out of the editing window (e.g. top of the page). Needs investigation to figure out what's going on. I suspect it's more than just CSS because a quick glance at the console suggests that tab search is not being activated at all, not just being hidden under something."

It wouldn't be as bad if I really was a new user, because I wouldn't have in mind that many hotkeys from the get-go -- as it stands for me, it feels laborious to re-enter all the hotkeys I once had.\r\n\r\nEven for the new user, it would be really handy to have a button in the options that adds a new hotkey entry and prefills at least the target and match prefix (maybe default use target as prefix) with the current tab. That would fit really well into the organic process of adding hotkeys as the user goes to each website that they realize would be good to have a hotkey for.\r\n\r\nThe actual button text needs some thought to make it clear and concise, in conjunction with the existing button (maybe that text should be changed in response too)."

But it's not a complete solution, because now the UI runs within the iframe, which looks particularly weird with small windows like on hangouts.google.com. The only case where it's a more than cosmetic problem is tab search, where the results can be obscured within a small window. I think it's still rather an edge case, and the work-to-UX-gains ratio is high.\r\n\r\nTo fix it, we can follow an approach like in https://stackoverflow.com/a/12904047, which is where I started for the solution to #25."

But it's not a complete solution, because now the UI runs within the iframe, which looks particularly weird with small windows like on hangouts.google.com. The only case where it's a more than cosmetic problem is tab search, where the results can be obscured within a small window. I think it's still rather an edge case, and the work-to-UX-gains ratio is high.\r\n\r\nTo fix it, we can follow an approach like in https://stackoverflow.com/a/12904047, which is where I started for the solution to #25."

It wouldn't be as bad if I really was a new user, because I wouldn't have in mind that many hotkeys from the get-go -- as it stands for me, it feels laborious to re-enter all the hotkeys I once had.\r\n\r\nEven for the new user, it would be really handy to have a button in the options that adds a new hotkey entry and prefills at least the target and match prefix (maybe default use target as prefix) with the current tab. That would fit really well into the organic process of adding hotkeys as the user goes to each website that they realize would be good to have a hotkey for.\r\n\r\nThe actual button text needs some thought to make it clear and concise, in conjunction with the existing button (maybe that text should be changed in response too)."
