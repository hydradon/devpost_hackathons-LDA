            "body": "Currently, state management is achieved by using a Mixin exported by [src/store/index.ts](/awesome-schedule/Awesome-SchedulAR/blob/master/src/store/index.ts). The advantage of this solution is that it is relatively easy to use global states and shared methods (by just calling `this[storeModuleName].someState`). However, the downside is that the Mixin is instantiated every time a component using it is created, which causes subsequent problems, such as waste of resources and watchers inside the Store class are triggered multiple times. The duplicated watcher triggering is temporarily solved by using a `delay` decorator that cancels the subsequent calls within a short period of time to the watch handler.\r\n\r\nThe ideal solution would require instantiating the Store mixin only one time. A simple alternative is to export an already instantiated Store instance in [src/store/index.ts](/awesome-schedule/Awesome-SchedulAR/blob/master/src/store/index.ts) and use that instance exclusively. Although technically this is easy to achieve, this solution requires tedious work, including changing the usage of `this.display.xxx` to `store.display.xxx`."
