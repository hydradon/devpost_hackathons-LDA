The reason for this is because these are built in features within the plotly.js library. So there would be no way to _let the server know_ that the state of the line chart had changed. \r\n\r\nAs of now this is fine to put off. Other drill down features such as clicking on the city or state (along with hovering and other events) should be doable."
