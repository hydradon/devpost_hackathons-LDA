Therefore, when I import all the non-duplicate data, I only see about 200,000 QA pairs, not the 700,000 which your repo mentions.  Is the rest of the data somewhere else.  Please kindly let me know how to import the entire 700,000 QA Dataset.\r\n\r\nThank you!"

Before I tried to trained \"our own data\", I managed to run DocProductPresentation successfully (as well as downloading all necessary files). \r\n\r\nTo trained our own data, I downloaded the \"sampleData.csv\" and Train_Your_Own_QA  notebook file. When I tried to run the training, I notice that I got OOM error (My GPU is RTX 2070 8GB). So, my first step is to reduce the batch size by half and so on. However, even after I set batch size to 1, I still got OOM error. Therefore, I played a little bit with \"bert_config.json\" from BioBert pre-train model and change the num_hidden_layers to 6 (default is 12) and it ran. Also, I noticed that you set the num_epochs to 1 so I didn't change it. \r\n\r\nOnce the training is finished (it took around 35 mins), I used DocProductPresentation notebook to test the new model. However, the result is totally out of the topic from the question I asked. Therefore to test if this new model work as intended, I copied one question from \"sampleData.csv\" and I still got out of topic answer.\r\n\r\n So, my questions are, \r\n1. What GPU you use to trained your model? Is 8 GB VRAM not enough? Does the OOM error comes from Loading BioBERT model or from your architecture?\r\n2. Did you use num_epochs 1 in training \"sampleData.csv\" and got good result? If not, what are good parameters I need to use?\r\n3. I notice, you used \"Float16EmbeddingsExpanded.pkl\" in DocProductPresentation notebook but not in the training our own QA. Then, what is the importance of this file?\r\n4. Does the answer is auto-generated or just retrieved from \"sampleData.csv\"? If this is a retrieval, the model must look from a some kind of database or a pool of QA, where is this?\r\n5. Also, I couldn't find some of the result answers from the \"sampleData.csv\", where do these answers come from?\r\n\r\nThank you so much for your help."

            "body": "Hi all, \r\nFirst of all, thank you so much for releasing such a brilliant work. I need your help in understanding the tutorial jupyter-notebook of training our own QA. Before I tried to trained \"our own data\", I managed to run DocProductPresentation successfully (as well as downloading all necessary files). \r\n\r\nTo trained our own data, I downloaded the \"sampleData.csv\" and Train_Your_Own_QA  notebook file. When I tried to run the training, I notice that I got OOM error (My GPU is RTX 2070 8GB). So, my first step is to reduce the batch size by half and so on. However, even after I set batch size to 1, I still got OOM error. Therefore, I played a little bit with \"bert_config.json\" from BioBert pre-train model and change the num_hidden_layers to 6 (default is 12) and it ran. Also, I noticed that you set the num_epochs to 1 so I didn't change it. \r\n\r\nOnce the training is finished (it took around 35 mins), I used DocProductPresentation notebook to test the new model. However, the result is totally out of the topic from the question I asked. Therefore to test if this new model work as intended, I copied one question from \"sampleData.csv\" and I still got out of topic answer.\r\n\r\n So, my questions are, \r\n1. What GPU you use to trained your model? Is 8 GB VRAM not enough? Does the OOM error comes from Loading BioBERT model or from your architecture?\r\n2. Did you use num_epochs 1 in training \"sampleData.csv\" and got good result? If not, what are good parameters I need to use?\r\n3. I notice, you used \"Float16EmbeddingsExpanded.pkl\" in DocProductPresentation notebook but not in the training our own QA. Then, what is the importance of this file?\r\n4. Does the answer is auto-generated or just retrieved from \"sampleData.csv\"? If this is a retrieval, the model must look from a some kind of database or a pool of QA, where is this?\r\n5. Also, I couldn't find some of the result answers from the \"sampleData.csv\", where do these answers come from?\r\n\r\nThank you so much for your help."

Before I tried to trained \"our own data\", I managed to run DocProductPresentation successfully (as well as downloading all necessary files). \r\n\r\nTo trained our own data, I downloaded the \"sampleData.csv\" and Train_Your_Own_QA  notebook file. When I tried to run the training, I notice that I got OOM error (My GPU is RTX 2070 8GB). So, my first step is to reduce the batch size by half and so on. However, even after I set batch size to 1, I still got OOM error. Therefore, I played a little bit with \"bert_config.json\" from BioBert pre-train model and change the num_hidden_layers to 6 (default is 12) and it ran. Also, I noticed that you set the num_epochs to 1 so I didn't change it. \r\n\r\nOnce the training is finished (it took around 35 mins), I used DocProductPresentation notebook to test the new model. However, the result is totally out of the topic from the question I asked. Therefore to test if this new model work as intended, I copied one question from \"sampleData.csv\" and I still got out of topic answer.\r\n\r\n So, my questions are, \r\n1. What GPU you use to trained your model? Is 8 GB VRAM not enough? Does the OOM error comes from Loading BioBERT model or from your architecture?\r\n2. Did you use num_epochs 1 in training \"sampleData.csv\" and got good result? If not, what are good parameters I need to use?\r\n3. I notice, you used \"Float16EmbeddingsExpanded.pkl\" in DocProductPresentation notebook but not in the training our own QA. Then, what is the importance of this file?\r\n4. Does the answer is auto-generated or just retrieved from \"sampleData.csv\"? If this is a retrieval, the model must look from a some kind of database or a pool of QA, where is this?\r\n5. Also, I couldn't find some of the result answers from the \"sampleData.csv\", where do these answers come from?\r\n\r\nThank you so much for your help."

            "body": "Hi all, \r\nFirst of all, thank you so much for releasing such a brilliant work. I need your help in understanding the tutorial jupyter-notebook of training our own QA. Before I tried to trained \"our own data\", I managed to run DocProductPresentation successfully (as well as downloading all necessary files). \r\n\r\nTo trained our own data, I downloaded the \"sampleData.csv\" and Train_Your_Own_QA  notebook file. When I tried to run the training, I notice that I got OOM error (My GPU is RTX 2070 8GB). So, my first step is to reduce the batch size by half and so on. However, even after I set batch size to 1, I still got OOM error. Therefore, I played a little bit with \"bert_config.json\" from BioBert pre-train model and change the num_hidden_layers to 6 (default is 12) and it ran. Also, I noticed that you set the num_epochs to 1 so I didn't change it. \r\n\r\nOnce the training is finished (it took around 35 mins), I used DocProductPresentation notebook to test the new model. However, the result is totally out of the topic from the question I asked. Therefore to test if this new model work as intended, I copied one question from \"sampleData.csv\" and I still got out of topic answer.\r\n\r\n So, my questions are, \r\n1. What GPU you use to trained your model? Is 8 GB VRAM not enough? Does the OOM error comes from Loading BioBERT model or from your architecture?\r\n2. Did you use num_epochs 1 in training \"sampleData.csv\" and got good result? If not, what are good parameters I need to use?\r\n3. I notice, you used \"Float16EmbeddingsExpanded.pkl\" in DocProductPresentation notebook but not in the training our own QA. Then, what is the importance of this file?\r\n4. Does the answer is auto-generated or just retrieved from \"sampleData.csv\"? If this is a retrieval, the model must look from a some kind of database or a pool of QA, where is this?\r\n5. Also, I couldn't find some of the result answers from the \"sampleData.csv\", where do these answers come from?\r\n\r\nThank you so much for your help."

            "body": "Hello!\r\nThere are 2 links under https://github.com/Santosh-Gupta/datasets:\r\n\r\n1 - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PymmjbrgfOIs-HJ7oBmjZKH8j4rYsGZj\r\n2 - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kYD57uStDd4kXyb3JOYCTQd92Al6Il4K\r\n\r\nHowever, there are duplicates in both links; for example each of the AskDocs.csv and icliniqQAs.csv is found in both links.  Therefore, when I import all the non-duplicate data, I only see about 200,000 QA pairs, not the 700,000 which your repo mentions.  Is the rest of the data somewhere else.  Please kindly let me know how to import the entire 700,000 QA Dataset.\r\n\r\nThank you!"
