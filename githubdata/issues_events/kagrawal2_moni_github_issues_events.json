This fixes a potential security issue under the following scenario:\r\n> \r\n> 1. A `--download` request with no explicit `--output` is made (e.g., `$ http -d  example.org/file.txt`), instructing HTTPie to [generate the output filename](https://httpie.org/doc#downloaded-filename) from the `Content-Disposition` response header, or from the URL if the header is not provided.\r\n> 2. The server handling the request has been modified by an attacker and instead of the expected response the URL returns a redirect to another URL, e.g., `attacker.example.org/.bash_profile`, whose response does not provide  a `Content-Disposition` header (i.e., the base for the  generated filename becomes `.bash_profile` instead of `file.txt`).\r\n> 3.
