This closes \n> a leak that only half closed in versions 4.0.13 and 4.1.0, but it is a slight incompatibility.\n> \n> This kind of access is not the intended use of Handlebars and leads to the vulnerability described\n> in [#1495](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1495). We will **not** increase the major version, because such use is not intended or documented, \n> and because of the potential impact of the issue (we fear that most people won't use a new major version\n> and the issue may not be resolved on many systems). \n> \n> \n> [Commits](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/compare/v4.0.13...v4.0.14)\n> \n> ## v4.0.13 - February 7th, 2019\n> New Features\n> \n> - none\n> \n> Security fixes:\n> \n> - disallow access to the constructor in templates to prevent RCE - 42841c4, [#1495](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1495)\n> \n> Housekeeping\n> \n> - chore: fix components/handlebars package.json and auto-update on release - bacd473\n> - chore: Use node 10 to build handlebars - 78dd89c\n> \n> Compatibility notes:\n> \n> Access to class constructors (i.e. `({}).constructor`) is now prohibited to prevent\n> Remote Code Execution.
