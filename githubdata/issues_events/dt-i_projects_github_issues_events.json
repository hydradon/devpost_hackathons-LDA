            "body": "Collateral consequences are legal and regulatory sanctions and restrictions that limit or prohibit people with criminal records from accessing employment, occupational licensing, housing, voting, education, and other opportunities. Collateral consequences most frequently affect people who have been convicted of a crime, though in some states an arrest alone\u2014even an arrest that doesn't result in a conviction\u2014may trigger a collateral consequence.\r\n\r\nSome collateral consequences serve a legitimate public safety or regulatory function, such as keeping firearms out of the hands of people convicted of domestic violence offenses, prohibiting people convicted of abuse from working with children or the elderly, or barring people convicted of fraud from positions of public trust. Others are directly related to the particular crime, such as registration requirements for sex offenders, driver\u2019s license restrictions for people convicted of a serious traffic offense, or debarment of people convicted of fraud. But many collateral consequences apply to people convicted of any crime, without regard to any relationship between the crime and opportunity being restricted, and frequently without consideration of how long ago the crime occurred or the person\u2019s rehabilitation efforts since. Collateral consequences with overbroad restrictions that offer no chance to overcome the restriction function as additional punishment and may discourage rehabilitation and ultimately increase recidivism.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is a way to make this information easier to digest than what is [currently offered](https://niccc.csgjusticecenter.org/map/).\r\n\r\nThis issue is worked upon as part of the [TubmanProject hackathon issue 5](https://github.com/TubmanProject/project-ideas/issues/5).\r\n\r\nHere is the Devpost link of the project:\r\nhttps://devpost.com/software/what-s-the-catch\r\n\r\nInitial work can found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Sllrdw1srWk8xDHHxGXf0142d4LNFu9O).\r\n"
