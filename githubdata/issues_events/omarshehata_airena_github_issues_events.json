If the client accesses the root directory, the server throws them into a random 5-character room (e.g. `/ab123`).  If they access an alphanumeric URL with a base path of any length (e.g. `/ab123` or `/mycustomroom`) directly, they'll be put in the appropriate room.\n\nThe rooms themselves are implemented using socket.io's \"room\" feature, and work by means of the client emitting a `join-room` on establishing a connection.  The server creates a new `gameroom` object as necessary (and destroys it when it's no longer needed) to manage gameplay in individual rooms.\n\nI tried to stick to your formatting and coding style where I could, but let me know if anything looks amiss!  Sorry about the whitespace garbage in the commits, my text editor was apparently hungry!\n"
