This shouldn't be an issue since this is a seeded location and any additional location inputed the through the form will be consistent since it will autocomplete. \n2) On a very few occasions (the only that i've seen is for The Nines), the expedia API finds a different hotel from the google information and as a result the wrong id is saved\n3) when creating a location, the form can be submitted prematurely by hitting \"enter/return\" and none of the location information is actually saved. form works correctly only when hitting the \"create location button\"  -- This can probably be solved with some additional event listeners?\n"
