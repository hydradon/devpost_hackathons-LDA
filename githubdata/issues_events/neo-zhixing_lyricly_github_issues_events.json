Greenkeeper supports lockfile updates for public packages. If you use private packages in your repository, please use [greenkeeper-lockfile](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper-lockfile) to make sure these can get updated as well.\n\nThis pull request **updates all your dependencies to their latest version**. Having them all up to date really is the best starting point for keeping up with new releases. Greenkeeper will look out for further dependency updates and make sure to handle them in isolation and in real-time, but only after **you merge this pull request**.\n\n**Important: Greenkeeper will only start watching this repository\u2019s dependency updates after you merge this initial pull request**.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udce6 \ud83d\udce6  Greenkeeper has detected multiple `package.json` files. They have all been added to a new `greenkeeper.json` config file. They\u2019ve been collected in a group called `default`, meaning that all of them will receive updates together. You can rename, add and remove groups and freely assign each `package.json` to whichever group you like. It\u2019s common, for example, to have one `frontend` group and one `backend` group, each with a couple of `package.json` files. In any case, all files in a group will have their updates collected into single PRs and issues. \n\n---\n<details>\n<summary>\ud83c\udff7 How to check the status of this repository</summary>\n\nGreenkeeper adds a badge to your README which indicates the status of this repository.\n\nThis is what your badge looks like right now :point_right:  ![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/Neo-Zhixing/GatherPlay.svg)\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>\ud83c\udfd7 How to configure Travis CI</summary>\n\nGreenkeeper has added a rule to your `.travis.yml` that whitelists Greenkeeper branches, which are created when your dependencies are updated. Travis CI will run your tests on these branches automatically to see if they still pass.\n\nNo additional setup is required \ud83d\ude0a\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>\ud83d\ude48 How to ignore certain dependencies</summary>\n\nYou may have good reasons for not wanting to update to a certain dependency right now. In this case, you can [change the dependency\u2019s version string in the `package.json` file back to whatever you prefer](https://github.com/Neo-Zhixing/GatherPlay/edit/greenkeeper/initial/package.json).\n\nTo make sure Greenkeeper doesn\u2019t nag you again on the next update, add a `greenkeeper.ignore` field to your `package.json`, containing a list of dependencies you don\u2019t want to update.\n\n```js\n// package.json\n{\n  \u2026\n  \"greenkeeper\": {\n    \"ignore\": [\n      \"package-names\",\n      \"you-want-me-to-ignore\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udcbb How to update this pull request</summary>\n\n```bash\n  # Change into your repository\u2019s directory\n  git fetch --all\n  git checkout greenkeeper/initial\n  npm install-test\n  # Adapt your code until everything works again\n  git commit -m 'chore: adapt code to updated dependencies'\n  git push https://github.com/Neo-Zhixing/GatherPlay.git greenkeeper/initial\n```\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>\u2728 How do dependency updates work with Greenkeeper?</summary>\n\nAfter you merge this pull request, **Greenkeeper will create a new branch whenever a  dependency is updated**, with the new version applied. The branch creation should trigger your testing services and check whether your code still works with the new dependency version. Depending on the the results of these tests Greenkeeper will try to open meaningful and helpful pull requests and issues, so your dependencies remain working and up-to-date.\n\n```diff\n-  \"underscore\": \"^1.6.0\"\n+  \"underscore\": \"^1.7.0\"\n```\n\nThe above example shows an in-range update. `1.7.0` is included in the old `^1.6.0` range, because of the [caret `^` character ](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver#ranges).\nWhen the test services report success Greenkeeper will silently delete the branch again, because no action needs to be taken \u2013 everything is fine.\n\nHowever, should the tests fail, Greenkeeper will create an issue to inform you about the problem immediately.\n\nThis way, you\u2019ll never be surprised by a dependency breaking your code. As long as everything still works, Greenkeeper will stay out of your way, and as soon as something goes wrong, you\u2019ll be the first to know.\n\n```diff\n-  \"lodash\": \"^3.0.0\"\n+  \"lodash\": \"^4.0.0\"\n```\n\nIn this example, the new version `4.0.0` is _not_ included in the old `^3.0.0` range.\nFor version updates like these \u2013 let\u2019s call them \u201cout of range\u201d updates \u2013 you\u2019ll receive a pull request.\n\nThis means that **you no longer need to check for new versions manually** \u2013 Greenkeeper will keep you up to date automatically.\n\nThese pull requests not only serve as reminders to update: If you have solid tests and good coverage, and the pull requests passes those tests, you can very likely just merge it and release a new version of your software straight away :shipit:\n\nTo get a better idea of which ranges apply to which releases, check out the extremely useful [semver calculator](https://semver.npmjs.com/) provided by npm.\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>FAQ and help</summary>\n\nThere is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html).

In this case, you can [change the dependency\u2019s version string in the `package.json` file back to whatever you prefer](https://github.com/Neo-Zhixing/GatherPlay/edit/greenkeeper/initial/package.json).\n\nTo make sure Greenkeeper doesn\u2019t nag you again on the next update, add a `greenkeeper.ignore` field to your `package.json`, containing a list of dependencies you don\u2019t want to update.\n\n```js\n// package.json\n{\n  \u2026\n  \"greenkeeper\": {\n    \"ignore\": [\n      \"package-names\",\n      \"you-want-me-to-ignore\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udcbb How to update this pull request</summary>\n\n```bash\n  # Change into your repository\u2019s directory\n  git fetch --all\n  git checkout greenkeeper/initial\n  npm install-test\n  # Adapt your code until everything works again\n  git commit -m 'chore: adapt code to updated dependencies'\n  git push https://github.com/Neo-Zhixing/GatherPlay.git greenkeeper/initial\n```\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>\u2728 How do dependency updates work with Greenkeeper?</summary>\n\nAfter you merge this pull request, **Greenkeeper will create a new branch whenever a  dependency is updated**, with the new version applied. The branch creation should trigger your testing services and check whether your code still works with the new dependency version. Depending on the the results of these tests Greenkeeper will try to open meaningful and helpful pull requests and issues, so your dependencies remain working and up-to-date.\n\n```diff\n-  \"underscore\": \"^1.6.0\"\n+  \"underscore\": \"^1.7.0\"\n```\n\nThe above example shows an in-range update. `1.7.0` is included in the old `^1.6.0` range, because of the [caret `^` character ](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver#ranges).\nWhen the test services report success Greenkeeper will silently delete the branch again, because no action needs to be taken \u2013 everything is fine.\n\nHowever, should the tests fail, Greenkeeper will create an issue to inform you about the problem immediately.\n\nThis way, you\u2019ll never be surprised by a dependency breaking your code. As long as everything still works, Greenkeeper will stay out of your way, and as soon as something goes wrong, you\u2019ll be the first to know.\n\n```diff\n-  \"lodash\": \"^3.0.0\"\n+  \"lodash\": \"^4.0.0\"\n```\n\nIn this example, the new version `4.0.0` is _not_ included in the old `^3.0.0` range.\nFor version updates like these \u2013 let\u2019s call them \u201cout of range\u201d updates \u2013 you\u2019ll receive a pull request.\n\nThis means that **you no longer need to check for new versions manually** \u2013 Greenkeeper will keep you up to date automatically.\n\nThese pull requests not only serve as reminders to update: If you have solid tests and good coverage, and the pull requests passes those tests, you can very likely just merge it and release a new version of your software straight away :shipit:\n\nTo get a better idea of which ranges apply to which releases, check out the extremely useful [semver calculator](https://semver.npmjs.com/) provided by npm.\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>FAQ and help</summary>\n\nThere is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html). If those don\u2019t help, you can always [ask the humans behind Greenkeeper](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).\n</details>\n\n\n---\n\nGood luck with your project and see you soon :sparkles:\n\nYour [Greenkeeper](https://greenkeeper.io) bot :palm_tree:\n"

Greenkeeper supports lockfile updates for public packages. If you use private packages in your repository, please use [greenkeeper-lockfile](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper-lockfile) to make sure these can get updated as well.\n\nThis pull request **updates all your dependencies to their latest version**. Having them all up to date really is the best starting point for keeping up with new releases. Greenkeeper will look out for further dependency updates and make sure to handle them in isolation and in real-time, but only after **you merge this pull request**.\n\n**Important: Greenkeeper will only start watching this repository\u2019s dependency updates after you merge this initial pull request**.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udce6 \ud83d\udce6  Greenkeeper has detected multiple `package.json` files. They have all been added to a new `greenkeeper.json` config file. They\u2019ve been collected in a group called `default`, meaning that all of them will receive updates together. You can rename, add and remove groups and freely assign each `package.json` to whichever group you like. It\u2019s common, for example, to have one `frontend` group and one `backend` group, each with a couple of `package.json` files. In any case, all files in a group will have their updates collected into single PRs and issues. \n\n---\n<details>\n<summary>\ud83c\udff7 How to check the status of this repository</summary>\n\nGreenkeeper adds a badge to your README which indicates the status of this repository.\n\nThis is what your badge looks like right now :point_right:  ![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/Neo-Zhixing/GatherPlay.svg)\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>\ud83c\udfd7 How to configure Travis CI</summary>\n\nGreenkeeper has added a rule to your `.travis.yml` that whitelists Greenkeeper branches, which are created when your dependencies are updated.

Greenkeeper supports lockfile updates for public packages. If you use private packages in your repository, please use [greenkeeper-lockfile](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper-lockfile) to make sure these can get updated as well.\n\nThis pull request **updates all your dependencies to their latest version**. Having them all up to date really is the best starting point for keeping up with new releases. Greenkeeper will look out for further dependency updates and make sure to handle them in isolation and in real-time, but only after **you merge this pull request**.\n\n**Important: Greenkeeper will only start watching this repository\u2019s dependency updates after you merge this initial pull request**.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udce6 \ud83d\udce6  Greenkeeper has detected multiple `package.json` files. They have all been added to a new `greenkeeper.json` config file. They\u2019ve been collected in a group called `default`, meaning that all of them will receive updates together. You can rename, add and remove groups and freely assign each `package.json` to whichever group you like. It\u2019s common, for example, to have one `frontend` group and one `backend` group, each with a couple of `package.json` files. In any case, all files in a group will have their updates collected into single PRs and issues. \n\n---\n<details>\n<summary>\ud83c\udff7 How to check the status of this repository</summary>\n\nGreenkeeper adds a badge to your README which indicates the status of this repository.\n\nThis is what your badge looks like right now :point_right:  ![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/Neo-Zhixing/GatherPlay.svg)\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>\ud83c\udfd7 How to configure Travis CI</summary>\n\nGreenkeeper has added a rule to your `.travis.yml` that whitelists Greenkeeper branches, which are created when your dependencies are updated. Travis CI will run your tests on these branches automatically to see if they still pass.\n\nNo additional setup is required \ud83d\ude0a\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>\ud83d\ude48 How to ignore certain dependencies</summary>\n\nYou may have good reasons for not wanting to update to a certain dependency right now. In this case, you can [change the dependency\u2019s version string in the `package.json` file back to whatever you prefer](https://github.com/Neo-Zhixing/GatherPlay/edit/greenkeeper/initial/package.json).\n\nTo make sure Greenkeeper doesn\u2019t nag you again on the next update, add a `greenkeeper.ignore` field to your `package.json`, containing a list of dependencies you don\u2019t want to update.\n\n```js\n// package.json\n{\n  \u2026\n  \"greenkeeper\": {\n    \"ignore\": [\n      \"package-names\",\n      \"you-want-me-to-ignore\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udcbb How to update this pull request</summary>\n\n```bash\n  # Change into your repository\u2019s directory\n  git fetch --all\n  git checkout greenkeeper/initial\n  npm install-test\n  # Adapt your code until everything works again\n  git commit -m 'chore: adapt code to updated dependencies'\n  git push https://github.com/Neo-Zhixing/GatherPlay.git greenkeeper/initial\n```\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>\u2728 How do dependency updates work with Greenkeeper?</summary>\n\nAfter you merge this pull request, **Greenkeeper will create a new branch whenever a  dependency is updated**, with the new version applied. The branch creation should trigger your testing services and check whether your code still works with the new dependency version. Depending on the the results of these tests Greenkeeper will try to open meaningful and helpful pull requests and issues, so your dependencies remain working and up-to-date.\n\n```diff\n-  \"underscore\": \"^1.6.0\"\n+  \"underscore\": \"^1.7.0\"\n```\n\nThe above example shows an in-range update. `1.7.0` is included in the old `^1.6.0` range, because of the [caret `^` character ](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver#ranges).\nWhen the test services report success Greenkeeper will silently delete the branch again, because no action needs to be taken \u2013 everything is fine.\n\nHowever, should the tests fail, Greenkeeper will create an issue to inform you about the problem immediately.\n\nThis way, you\u2019ll never be surprised by a dependency breaking your code. As long as everything still works, Greenkeeper will stay out of your way, and as soon as something goes wrong, you\u2019ll be the first to know.\n\n```diff\n-  \"lodash\": \"^3.0.0\"\n+  \"lodash\": \"^4.0.0\"\n```\n\nIn this example, the new version `4.0.0` is _not_ included in the old `^3.0.0` range.\nFor version updates like these \u2013 let\u2019s call them \u201cout of range\u201d updates \u2013 you\u2019ll receive a pull request.\n\nThis means that **you no longer need to check for new versions manually** \u2013 Greenkeeper will keep you up to date automatically.\n\nThese pull requests not only serve as reminders to update: If you have solid tests and good coverage, and the pull requests passes those tests, you can very likely just merge it and release a new version of your software straight away :shipit:\n\nTo get a better idea of which ranges apply to which releases, check out the extremely useful [semver calculator](https://semver.npmjs.com/) provided by npm.\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>FAQ and help</summary>\n\nThere is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html). If those don\u2019t help, you can always [ask the humans behind Greenkeeper](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).\n</details>\n\n\n---\n\nGood luck with your project and see you soon :sparkles:\n\nYour [Greenkeeper](https://greenkeeper.io) bot :palm_tree:\n"
