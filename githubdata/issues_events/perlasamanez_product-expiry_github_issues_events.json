Please try to use [valid selectors](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#value-def-identifier) or the `data-target` HTML attribute/`target` option where available.\r\n> - **Fixed:** Reverted v4.2.1's change to the breakpoint and grid container Sass maps that blocked folks from upgrading when modifying those default variables.\r\n> - **Fixed:** Restored `white-space: nowrap` to `.dropdown-toggle` (before v4.2.1 it was on all `.btn`s) so carets don't wrap to new lines.\r\n> - **Deprecated:** `img-retina`, `invisible`, `float`, and `size` mixins are now deprecated and will be removed in v5.\r\n> \r\n> ### Links\r\n> - [Read the full ship list](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/27893)\r\n> - [Review the project board](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/projects/16)\n> \n> ## v4.2.1\n> Bump to v4.2.1 to republish package on npm. [See v4.2.0 release notes](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases/tag/v4.2.0) for changes introduced in v4.2.\n> \n> ## v4.2.0\n> Here are the highlights of what's new and updated in v4.2.\r\n> \r\n> - **New:** Added a new spinner loading component.\r\n> - **New:** Added new toast component for displaying notifications.\r\n> - **New:** Added a new iOS style switch (a modifier class to our custom checkboxes).\r\n> - **New:** Added touch support in our carousel component.\r\n> - **New:** Added `.font-weight-lighter` and `.font-weight-bolder` utilities.\r\n> - **New:** Added `.text-decoration-none` utility class.\r\n> - **New:** Added `.modal-xl` modifier class for our modals.\r\n> - **New:** Added new negative margin utility classes (e.g., `.mb-n3`). These rad new classes not only allow you more control over your general spacing needs, but also allow you to create responsive grid gutters at each breakpoint.\r\n> - **New:** Validated form fields now have feedback icons on `:invalid` and `:valid` fields.
