This has the side-effect of changing carrierwave's support from `0.2.1` to `0.2.2`.\n> \n> ## 5.0.0\n> \n> ### Enhancements\n> * Set multiple attribute for grouped selects also. [@&#8203;ollym](https://github.com/ollym)\n> * Removes or renames label classes. [Abduvakilov](https://github.com/Abduvakilov)\n> * Support to label custom classes for inline collections. [@&#8203;feliperenan](https://github.com/feliperenan)\n> * Update bootstrap generator template to match v4.3.x. [@&#8203;m5o](https://github.com/m5o)\n> * Allow \"required\" attribute in generated select elements of PriorityInput. [@&#8203;mcountis](https://github.com/mcountis)\n> \n> ### Bug fix\n> * Do not call `#send` in form object to check whether the attribute is a file input. [@&#8203;tegon](https://github.com/tegon)\n> \n> ## Deprecations\n> * The config `SimpleForm.file_methods` is deprecated and it has no effect.

This has the side-effect of changing carrierwave's support from `0.2.1` to `0.2.2`.\n> \n> ## 5.0.0\n> \n> ### Enhancements\n> * Set multiple attribute for grouped selects also. [@&#8203;ollym](https://github.com/ollym)\n> * Removes or renames label classes. [Abduvakilov](https://github.com/Abduvakilov)\n> * Support to label custom classes for inline collections.

[@&#8203;m5o](https://github.com/m5o)\n> * Allow \"required\" attribute in generated select elements of PriorityInput. [@&#8203;mcountis](https://github.com/mcountis)\n> \n> ### Bug fix\n> * Do not call `#send` in form object to check whether the attribute is a file input. [@&#8203;tegon](https://github.com/tegon)\n> \n> ## Deprecations\n> * The config `SimpleForm.file_methods` is deprecated and it has no effect.
