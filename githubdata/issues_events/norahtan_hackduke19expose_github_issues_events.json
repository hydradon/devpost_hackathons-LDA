This means that Python modules are under `tf.lite` and source code is now under `tensorflow/lite` rather than `tensorflow/contrib/lite`.\n> * TensorFlow GPU binaries are now built against CUDA 10 and TensorRT 5.0.\n> * Support for Python3.7 on all operating systems.\n> * Moved NCCL to core.\n> \n> ## Behavioral changes\n> \n> * Disallow conversion of python floating types to uint32/64 (matching behavior of other integer types) in `tf.constant`.\n> * Make the `gain` argument of convolutional orthogonal initializers (`convolutional_delta_orthogonal`, `convolutional_orthogonal_1D`, `convolutional_orthogonal_2D`, `convolutional_orthogonal_3D`) have consistent behavior with the `tf.initializers.orthogonal` initializer, i.e. scale the output l2-norm by `gain` and NOT by `sqrt(gain)`. (Note that these functions are currently in `tf.contrib` which is not guaranteed backward compatible).\n> \n> ## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n> \n> *   Documentation\n>     *   Update the doc with the details about the rounding mode used in\n>         quantize_and_dequantize_v2.\n>     *   Clarify that tensorflow::port::InitMain() _should_ be called before\n>         using the TensorFlow library. Programs failing to do this are not\n>         portable to all platforms.\n> *   Deprecations and Symbol renames.\n>     *   Removing deprecations for the following endpoints: `tf.acos`,\n>         `tf.acosh`, `tf.add`, `tf.as_string`, `tf.asin`, `tf.asinh`, `tf.atan`,\n>         `tf.atan2`, `tf.atanh`, `tf.cos`, `tf.cosh`, `tf.equal`, `tf.exp`,\n>         `tf.floor`, `tf.greater`, `tf.greater_equal`, `tf.less`,\n>         `tf.less_equal`, `tf.log`, `tf.logp1`, `tf.logical_and`,\n>         `tf.logical_not`, `tf.logical_or`, `tf.maximum`, `tf.minimum`,\n>         `tf.not_equal`, `tf.sin`, `tf.sinh`, `tf.tan`\n>     *   Deprecate `tf.data.Dataset.shard`.\n>     *   Deprecate `saved_model.loader.load` which is replaced by\n>         `saved_model.load` and `saved_model.main_op`, which will be replaced by\n>         `saved_model.main_op` in V2.\n>     *   Deprecate tf.QUANTIZED_DTYPES. The official new symbol is\n>         tf.dtypes.QUANTIZED_DTYPES.\n>     *   Update sklearn imports for deprecated packages.\n>     *   Deprecate `Variable.count_up_to` and `tf.count_up_to` in favor of\n>         `Dataset.range`.\n>     *   Export `confusion_matrix` op as `tf.math.confusion_matrix` instead of\n>         `tf.train.confusion_matrix`.\n>     *   Add `tf.dtypes.` endpoint for every constant in dtypes.py. Moving\n>         endpoints in versions.py to corresponding endpoints in `tf.sysconfig.`\n></tr></table> ...

This means that Python modules are under `tf.lite` and source code is now under `tensorflow/lite` rather than `tensorflow/contrib/lite`.\n> * TensorFlow GPU binaries are now built against CUDA 10 and TensorRT 5.0.\n> * Support for Python3.7 on all operating systems.\n> * Moved NCCL to core.\n> \n> ## Behavioral changes\n> \n> * Disallow conversion of python floating types to uint32/64 (matching behavior of other integer types) in `tf.constant`.\n> * Make the `gain` argument of convolutional orthogonal initializers (`convolutional_delta_orthogonal`, `convolutional_orthogonal_1D`, `convolutional_orthogonal_2D`, `convolutional_orthogonal_3D`) have consistent behavior with the `tf.initializers.orthogonal` initializer, i.e. scale the output l2-norm by `gain` and NOT by `sqrt(gain)`. (Note that these functions are currently in `tf.contrib` which is not guaranteed backward compatible).\n> \n> ## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n> \n> *   Documentation\n>     *   Update the doc with the details about the rounding mode used in\n>         quantize_and_dequantize_v2.\n>     *   Clarify that tensorflow::port::InitMain() _should_ be called before\n>         using the TensorFlow library. Programs failing to do this are not\n>         portable to all platforms.\n> *   Deprecations and Symbol renames.\n>     *   Removing deprecations for the following endpoints: `tf.acos`,\n>         `tf.acosh`, `tf.add`, `tf.as_string`, `tf.asin`, `tf.asinh`, `tf.atan`,\n>         `tf.atan2`, `tf.atanh`, `tf.cos`, `tf.cosh`, `tf.equal`, `tf.exp`,\n>         `tf.floor`, `tf.greater`, `tf.greater_equal`, `tf.less`,\n>         `tf.less_equal`, `tf.log`, `tf.logp1`, `tf.logical_and`,\n>         `tf.logical_not`, `tf.logical_or`, `tf.maximum`, `tf.minimum`,\n>         `tf.not_equal`, `tf.sin`, `tf.sinh`, `tf.tan`\n>     *   Deprecate `tf.data.Dataset.shard`.\n>     *   Deprecate `saved_model.loader.load` which is replaced by\n>         `saved_model.load` and `saved_model.main_op`, which will be replaced by\n>         `saved_model.main_op` in V2.\n>     *   Deprecate tf.QUANTIZED_DTYPES. The official new symbol is\n>         tf.dtypes.QUANTIZED_DTYPES.\n>     *   Update sklearn imports for deprecated packages.\n>     *   Deprecate `Variable.count_up_to` and `tf.count_up_to` in favor of\n>         `Dataset.range`.\n>     *   Export `confusion_matrix` op as `tf.math.confusion_matrix` instead of\n>         `tf.train.confusion_matrix`.\n>     *   Add `tf.dtypes.` endpoint for every constant in dtypes.py. Moving\n>         endpoints in versions.py to corresponding endpoints in `tf.sysconfig.`\n></tr></table> ...
