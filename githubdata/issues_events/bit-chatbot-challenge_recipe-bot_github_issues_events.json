Currently I'm partial to the above implementation. It allows the flexibility of a quick search, but can also account for several dietary restrictions.\r\n\r\nAlso, should the bot respond with all the restrictions/allergies specified by the users? Not hard to add, but still thinking on how to make it \"conversational.\""
