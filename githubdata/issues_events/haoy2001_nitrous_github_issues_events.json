I figured I'd make the repository a little nicer too, but I didn't want to just throw them up there, so I'm making a PR instead.\r\n\r\nI basically just expanded the Readme and removed editor and built files (`.vscode`, `application.windows32`, `application.windows64`). I also changed the link to the screenshot to a relative link in the repository so we aren't relying on an outside source. I set `?raw=true` from advice from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/10189374/10549827). It helps with some stuff related to forking, but in practicality it mostly just makes the image bigger (and in doing so, centers it, since it takes up the whole page).\r\n\r\n\ud83d\ude42"
