In a normal case VM execution is always triggered from a invocation transaction so this error would not occur.\r\n\r\n**How did you solve this problem?**\r\nfix initialization of the VM for NEP-5 queries by using a fake/empty TX as container\r\n\r\n**How did you make sure your solution works?**\r\nmanually reproduced the issue before and after the fix\r\n\r\n**Are there any special changes in the code that we should be aware of?**\r\n\r\n**Please check the following, if applicable:**\r\n\r\n- [ ] Did you add any tests?\r\n- [X] Did you run `make lint`?\r\n- [X] Did you run `make test`?\r\n- [X] Are you making a PR to a feature branch or development rather than master?\r\n- [X] Did you add an entry to `CHANGELOG.rst`?

It does this by running the VM and trying to query known methods of a nep-5 contract. This query mechanism runs the VM without setting up a container (Transaction) that the query is ran from. In a normal case VM execution is always triggered from a invocation transaction so this error would not occur.\r\n\r\n**How did you solve this problem?**\r\nfix initialization of the VM for NEP-5 queries by using a fake/empty TX as container\r\n\r\n**How did you make sure your solution works?**\r\nmanually reproduced the issue before and after the fix\r\n\r\n**Are there any special changes in the code that we should be aware of?**\r\n\r\n**Please check the following, if applicable:**\r\n\r\n- [ ] Did you add any tests?\r\n- [X] Did you run `make lint`?\r\n- [X] Did you run `make test`?\r\n- [X] Are you making a PR to a feature branch or development rather than master?\r\n- [X] Did you add an entry to `CHANGELOG.rst`? (if not, please do)\r\n"

            "body": "_Rationale:_ \r\nPresumably when those running `neo-python` do not use it for hosting an RPC Server they'll often use it as a secure or trusted gateway for interacting with the blockchain from their own (internal) infrastructure. Arguably everybody that uses it for this purpose is re-inventing the wheel by creating some API server that existing system can talk to with a queue that pushes transactions to the network, monitors the transactions and reports back the results. \r\n\r\nOne good starting point is the Queue system created by @metachris in the Imusify project during the first CityOfZion dApp competition : [Transaction Queue](https://github.com/imusify/blockchain-middleware/blob/imusify2/imusify/imusmartcontract.py) \r\nThis tool is however unlikely to be known by many who could benefit from it. Also due to the high time pressure of a dApp competition it is not feature complete. Some notable shortcomings are: \r\n\r\n- Only accepts and monitors a single transaction at a time\r\n- Only works with a single wallet\r\n\r\nThe `neo-python` project can be servant to the community by providing a well thought out and tested solution to a common problem as part of its default suite. This will accelerate dApp development at at least one aspect of the process. \r\n\r\n_Goal:_\r\nCreate a well documented gateway on top of `neo-python` that can transmit multiple transactions per block, monitor the results and report this back to the user via callbacks or by being a blocking call. The community need on the preferred way of reporting back results is something still to research. Support sending from different wallets is secondary to multi-transaction support.\r\n"
