Python 2 support [officially ends an January 1, 2020](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/#update). [As announced earlier](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/announce/gVwS5RC8mds/dCt1ka2XAAAJ), TensorFlow will also stop supporting Python 2 starting January 1, 2020, and no more releases are expected in 2019.\n> \n> ## Major Features and Improvements\n> * The `tensorflow` pip package now includes GPU support by default (same as `tensorflow-gpu`) for both Linux and Windows. This runs on machines with and without NVIDIA GPUs. `tensorflow-gpu` is still available, and CPU-only packages can be downloaded at `tensorflow-cpu` for users who are concerned about package size.\n> * **Windows users:** Officially-released `tensorflow` Pip packages are now built with Visual Studio 2019 version 16.4 in order to take advantage of the new `/d2ReducedOptimizeHugeFunctions` compiler flag. To use these new packages, you must install \"Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019\", available from Microsoft's website [here](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads).\n>   * This does not change the minimum required version for building TensorFlow from source on Windows, but builds enabling `EIGEN_STRONG_INLINE` can take over 48 hours to compile without this flag. Refer to `configure.py` for more information about `EIGEN_STRONG_INLINE` and `/d2ReducedOptimizeHugeFunctions`.\n>   * If either of the required DLLs, `msvcp140.dll` (old) or `msvcp140_1.dll` (new), are missing on your machine, `import tensorflow` will print a warning message.\n> * The `tensorflow` pip package is built with CUDA 10.1 and cuDNN 7.6.\n> * `tf.keras`\n>   * Experimental support for mixed precision is available on GPUs and Cloud TPUs. See [usage guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/mixed_precision).\n>   * Introduced the `TextVectorization` layer, which takes as input raw strings and takes care of text standardization, tokenization, n-gram generation, and vocabulary indexing. See this [end-to-end text classification example](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1RvCnR7h0_l4Ekn5vINWToI9TNJdpUZB3).\n>   * Keras `.compile` `.fit` `.evaluate` and `.predict` are allowed to be outside of the DistributionStrategy scope, as long as the model was constructed inside of a scope.\n>   * Experimental support for Keras `.compile`, `.fit`, `.evaluate`, and `.predict` is available for Cloud TPUs, Cloud TPU, for all types of Keras models (sequential, functional and subclassing models).\n>   * Automatic outside compilation is now enabled for Cloud TPUs. This allows `tf.summary` to be used more conveniently with Cloud TPUs.\n>   * Dynamic batch sizes with DistributionStrategy and Keras are supported on Cloud TPUs.\n>   * Support for `.fit`, `.evaluate`, `.predict` on TPU using numpy data, in addition to `tf.data.Dataset`.\n>   * Keras reference implementations for many popular models are available in the TensorFlow [Model Garden](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official).\n> * `tf.data`\n>   * Changes rebatching for `tf.data datasets` + DistributionStrategy for better performance. Note that the dataset also behaves slightly differently, in that the rebatched dataset cardinality will always be a multiple of the number of replicas.\n>   * `tf.data.Dataset` now supports automatic data distribution and sharding in distributed environments, including on TPU pods.\n>   * Distribution policies for `tf.data.Dataset` can now be tuned with 1. `tf.data.experimental.AutoShardPolicy(OFF, AUTO, FILE, DATA)` 2. `tf.data.experimental.ExternalStatePolicy(WARN, IGNORE, FAIL)`\n> * `tf.debugging`\n>   * Add `tf.debugging.enable_check_numerics()` and `tf.debugging.disable_check_numerics()` to help debugging the root causes of issues involving infinities and `NaN`s.\n> * `tf.distribute`\n>   * Custom training loop support on TPUs and TPU pods is avaiable through `strategy.experimental_distribute_dataset`, `strategy.experimental_distribute_datasets_from_function`, `strategy.experimental_run_v2`, `strategy.reduce`.\n>   * Support for a global distribution strategy through `tf.distribute.experimental_set_strategy(),` in addition to `strategy.scope()`.\n> * `TensorRT`\n>   * [TensorRT 6.0](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt#tensorrt-whats-new) is now supported and enabled by default. This adds support for more TensorFlow ops including Conv3D, Conv3DBackpropInputV2, AvgPool3D, MaxPool3D, ResizeBilinear, and ResizeNearestNeighbor. In addition, the TensorFlow-TensorRT python conversion API is exported as `tf.experimental.tensorrt.Converter`.\n> * Environment variable `TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS` has been added. When set to \"true\" or \"1\", this environment variable makes `tf.nn.bias_add` operate deterministically (i.e. reproducibly), but currently only when XLA JIT compilation is *not* enabled. Setting `TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS` to \"true\" or \"1\" also makes cuDNN convolution and max-pooling operate deterministically. This makes Keras Conv\\*D and MaxPool\\*D layers operate deterministically in both the forward and backward directions when running on a CUDA-enabled GPU.\n> \n> ## Breaking Changes\n> * Deletes `Operation.traceback_with_start_lines` for which we know of no usages.\n></tr></table> ...

Python 2 support [officially ends an January 1, 2020](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/#update). [As announced earlier](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/announce/gVwS5RC8mds/dCt1ka2XAAAJ), TensorFlow will also stop supporting Python 2 starting January 1, 2020, and no more releases are expected in 2019.\n> \n> ## Major Features and Improvements\n> * The `tensorflow` pip package now includes GPU support by default (same as `tensorflow-gpu`) for both Linux and Windows. This runs on machines with and without NVIDIA GPUs. `tensorflow-gpu` is still available, and CPU-only packages can be downloaded at `tensorflow-cpu` for users who are concerned about package size.\n> * **Windows users:** Officially-released `tensorflow` Pip packages are now built with Visual Studio 2019 version 16.4 in order to take advantage of the new `/d2ReducedOptimizeHugeFunctions` compiler flag. To use these new packages, you must install \"Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019\", available from Microsoft's website [here](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads).\n>   * This does not change the minimum required version for building TensorFlow from source on Windows, but builds enabling `EIGEN_STRONG_INLINE` can take over 48 hours to compile without this flag. Refer to `configure.py` for more information about `EIGEN_STRONG_INLINE` and `/d2ReducedOptimizeHugeFunctions`.\n>   * If either of the required DLLs, `msvcp140.dll` (old) or `msvcp140_1.dll` (new), are missing on your machine, `import tensorflow` will print a warning message.\n> * The `tensorflow` pip package is built with CUDA 10.1 and cuDNN 7.6.\n> * `tf.keras`\n>   * Experimental support for mixed precision is available on GPUs and Cloud TPUs. See [usage guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/mixed_precision).\n>   * Introduced the `TextVectorization` layer, which takes as input raw strings and takes care of text standardization, tokenization, n-gram generation, and vocabulary indexing. See this [end-to-end text classification example](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1RvCnR7h0_l4Ekn5vINWToI9TNJdpUZB3).\n>   * Keras `.compile` `.fit` `.evaluate` and `.predict` are allowed to be outside of the DistributionStrategy scope, as long as the model was constructed inside of a scope.\n>   * Experimental support for Keras `.compile`, `.fit`, `.evaluate`, and `.predict` is available for Cloud TPUs, Cloud TPU, for all types of Keras models (sequential, functional and subclassing models).\n>   * Automatic outside compilation is now enabled for Cloud TPUs. This allows `tf.summary` to be used more conveniently with Cloud TPUs.\n>   * Dynamic batch sizes with DistributionStrategy and Keras are supported on Cloud TPUs.\n>   * Support for `.fit`, `.evaluate`, `.predict` on TPU using numpy data, in addition to `tf.data.Dataset`.\n>   * Keras reference implementations for many popular models are available in the TensorFlow [Model Garden](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official).\n> * `tf.data`\n>   * Changes rebatching for `tf.data datasets` + DistributionStrategy for better performance. Note that the dataset also behaves slightly differently, in that the rebatched dataset cardinality will always be a multiple of the number of replicas.\n>   * `tf.data.Dataset` now supports automatic data distribution and sharding in distributed environments, including on TPU pods.\n>   * Distribution policies for `tf.data.Dataset` can now be tuned with 1. `tf.data.experimental.AutoShardPolicy(OFF, AUTO, FILE, DATA)` 2. `tf.data.experimental.ExternalStatePolicy(WARN, IGNORE, FAIL)`\n> * `tf.debugging`\n>   * Add `tf.debugging.enable_check_numerics()` and `tf.debugging.disable_check_numerics()` to help debugging the root causes of issues involving infinities and `NaN`s.\n> * `tf.distribute`\n>   * Custom training loop support on TPUs and TPU pods is avaiable through `strategy.experimental_distribute_dataset`, `strategy.experimental_distribute_datasets_from_function`, `strategy.experimental_run_v2`, `strategy.reduce`.\n>   * Support for a global distribution strategy through `tf.distribute.experimental_set_strategy(),` in addition to `strategy.scope()`.\n> * `TensorRT`\n>   * [TensorRT 6.0](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt#tensorrt-whats-new) is now supported and enabled by default. This adds support for more TensorFlow ops including Conv3D, Conv3DBackpropInputV2, AvgPool3D, MaxPool3D, ResizeBilinear, and ResizeNearestNeighbor. In addition, the TensorFlow-TensorRT python conversion API is exported as `tf.experimental.tensorrt.Converter`.\n> * Environment variable `TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS` has been added. When set to \"true\" or \"1\", this environment variable makes `tf.nn.bias_add` operate deterministically (i.e. reproducibly), but currently only when XLA JIT compilation is *not* enabled. Setting `TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS` to \"true\" or \"1\" also makes cuDNN convolution and max-pooling operate deterministically. This makes Keras Conv\\*D and MaxPool\\*D layers operate deterministically in both the forward and backward directions when running on a CUDA-enabled GPU.\n> \n> ## Breaking Changes\n> * Deletes `Operation.traceback_with_start_lines` for which we know of no usages.\n></tr></table> ...

We have also released a collection of [tutorials and getting started guides](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta).\r\n> \r\n> ## Highlights\r\n> \r\n> * TF 2.0 delivers Keras as the central high level API used to build and train models. Keras provides several model-building APIs such as Sequential, Functional, and Subclassing along with eager execution, for immediate iteration and intuitive debugging, and `tf.data`, for building scalable input pipelines. Checkout [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/keras/overview) for additional details.\r\n> * Distribution Strategy: TF 2.0 users will be able to use the [`tf.distribute.Strategy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/distribute_strategy) API to distribute training with minimal code changes, yielding great out-of-the-box performance. It supports distributed training with Keras model.fit, as well as with custom training loops. Multi-GPU support is available, along with experimental support for multi worker and Cloud TPUs. Check out the [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/distribute_strategy) for more details.\r\n> * Functions, not Sessions. The traditional declarative programming model of building a graph and executing it via a `tf.Session` is discouraged, and replaced with by writing regular Python functions. Using the `tf.function` decorator, such functions can be turned into graphs which can be executed remotely, serialized, and optimized for performance.\r\n> * Unification of `tf.train.Optimizers` and `tf.keras.Optimizers`. Use `tf.keras.Optimizers` for TF2.0. `compute_gradients` is removed as public API, use `GradientTape` to compute gradients.\r\n> * AutoGraph translates Python control flow into TensorFlow expressions, allowing users to write regular Python inside `tf.function`-decorated functions. AutoGraph is also applied in functions used with tf.data, tf.distribute and tf.keras APIs. \r\n> * Unification of exchange formats to SavedModel. All TensorFlow ecosystem projects (TensorFlow Lite, TensorFlow JS, TensorFlow Serving, TensorFlow Hub) accept SavedModels. Model state should be saved to and restored from SavedModels.\r\n> * API Changes: Many API symbols have been renamed or removed, and argument names have changed. Many of these changes are motivated by consistency and clarity. The 1.x API remains available in the compat.v1 module. A list of all symbol changes can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FLFJLzg7WNP6JHODX5q8BDgptKafq_slHpnHVbJIteQ/edit#gid=0). \r\n>  * API clean-up, included removing `tf.app`, `tf.flags`, and `tf.logging` in favor of [absl-py](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-py).\r\n> * No more global variables with helper methods like `tf.global_variables_initializer` and `tf.get_global_step`.\r\n> * Add toggles `tf.enable_control_flow_v2()` and `tf.disable_control_flow_v2()` for enabling/disabling v2 control flow.\r\n> * Enable v2 control flow as part of `tf.enable_v2_behavior()` and `TF2_BEHAVIOR=1`.\r\n> * Fixes autocomplete for most TensorFlow API references by switching to use relative imports in API `__init__.py` files.\r\n> * Auto Mixed-Precision graph optimizer simplifies converting models to `float16` for acceleration on Volta and Turing Tensor Cores. This feature can be enabled by wrapping an optimizer class with `tf.train.experimental.enable_mixed_precision_graph_rewrite()`.\r\n> * Add environment variable `TF_CUDNN_DETERMINISTIC`. Setting to `TRUE` or \"1\" forces the selection of deterministic cuDNN convolution and max-pooling algorithms. When this is enabled, the algorithm selection procedure itself is also deterministic.\r\n> \r\n> ## Breaking Changes\r\n> * Many backwards incompatible API changes have been made to clean up the APIs and make them more consistent.\r\n> * Toolchains:\r\n>   * TensorFlow 2.0.0 is built using devtoolset7 (GCC7) on Ubuntu 16. This may lead to ABI incompatibilities with extensions built against earlier versions of TensorFlow.\r\n>   * Tensorflow code now produces 2 different pip packages: tensorflow_core containing all the code (in the future it will contain only the private implementation) and tensorflow which is a virtual pip package doing forwarding to tensorflow_core (and in the future will contain only the public API of tensorflow). We don't expect this to be breaking, unless you were importing directly from the implementation.\r\n>   Removed the `freeze_graph` command line tool; `SavedModel` should be used in place of frozen graphs.\r\n>   \r\n> * `tf.contrib`:\r\n>   * `tf.contrib` has been deprecated, and functionality has been either migrated to the core TensorFlow API, to an ecosystem project such as [tensorflow/addons](https://www.github.com/tensorflow/addons) or [tensorflow/io](https://www.github.com/tensorflow/io), or removed entirely.\r\n>   * Remove `tf.contrib.timeseries` dependency on TF distributions.\r\n>   * Replace contrib references with `tf.estimator.experimental.*` for apis in `early_stopping.py`.\r\n>   \r\n> * `tf.estimator`:\r\n>   * Premade estimators in the tf.estimator.DNN/Linear/DNNLinearCombined family have been updated to use `tf.keras.optimizers` instead of the `tf.compat.v1.train.Optimizer`s. If you do not pass in an `optimizer=` arg or if you use a string, the premade estimator will use the Keras optimizer. This is checkpoint breaking, as the optimizers have separate variables. A checkpoint converter tool for converting optimizers is included with the release,  but if you want to avoid any change, switch to the v1 version of the estimator:  `tf.compat.v1.estimator.DNN/Linear/DNNLinearCombined*`.\r\n>   * Default aggregation for canned Estimators is now `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE`. To maintain previous default behavior, please pass `SUM` as the loss aggregation method.\r\n>   * Canned Estimators don\u2019t support `input_layer_partitioner` arg in the API. If you have this arg, you will have to switch to `tf.compat.v1 canned Estimators`.\r\n></tr></table> ...

We have also released a collection of [tutorials and getting started guides](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta).\r\n> \r\n> ## Highlights\r\n> \r\n> * TF 2.0 delivers Keras as the central high level API used to build and train models. Keras provides several model-building APIs such as Sequential, Functional, and Subclassing along with eager execution, for immediate iteration and intuitive debugging, and `tf.data`, for building scalable input pipelines. Checkout [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/keras/overview) for additional details.\r\n> * Distribution Strategy: TF 2.0 users will be able to use the [`tf.distribute.Strategy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/distribute_strategy) API to distribute training with minimal code changes, yielding great out-of-the-box performance. It supports distributed training with Keras model.fit, as well as with custom training loops. Multi-GPU support is available, along with experimental support for multi worker and Cloud TPUs. Check out the [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/distribute_strategy) for more details.\r\n> * Functions, not Sessions. The traditional declarative programming model of building a graph and executing it via a `tf.Session` is discouraged, and replaced with by writing regular Python functions. Using the `tf.function` decorator, such functions can be turned into graphs which can be executed remotely, serialized, and optimized for performance.\r\n> * Unification of `tf.train.Optimizers` and `tf.keras.Optimizers`. Use `tf.keras.Optimizers` for TF2.0. `compute_gradients` is removed as public API, use `GradientTape` to compute gradients.\r\n> * AutoGraph translates Python control flow into TensorFlow expressions, allowing users to write regular Python inside `tf.function`-decorated functions. AutoGraph is also applied in functions used with tf.data, tf.distribute and tf.keras APIs. \r\n> * Unification of exchange formats to SavedModel. All TensorFlow ecosystem projects (TensorFlow Lite, TensorFlow JS, TensorFlow Serving, TensorFlow Hub) accept SavedModels. Model state should be saved to and restored from SavedModels.\r\n> * API Changes: Many API symbols have been renamed or removed, and argument names have changed. Many of these changes are motivated by consistency and clarity. The 1.x API remains available in the compat.v1 module. A list of all symbol changes can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FLFJLzg7WNP6JHODX5q8BDgptKafq_slHpnHVbJIteQ/edit#gid=0). \r\n>  * API clean-up, included removing `tf.app`, `tf.flags`, and `tf.logging` in favor of [absl-py](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-py).\r\n> * No more global variables with helper methods like `tf.global_variables_initializer` and `tf.get_global_step`.\r\n> * Add toggles `tf.enable_control_flow_v2()` and `tf.disable_control_flow_v2()` for enabling/disabling v2 control flow.\r\n> * Enable v2 control flow as part of `tf.enable_v2_behavior()` and `TF2_BEHAVIOR=1`.\r\n> * Fixes autocomplete for most TensorFlow API references by switching to use relative imports in API `__init__.py` files.\r\n> * Auto Mixed-Precision graph optimizer simplifies converting models to `float16` for acceleration on Volta and Turing Tensor Cores. This feature can be enabled by wrapping an optimizer class with `tf.train.experimental.enable_mixed_precision_graph_rewrite()`.\r\n> * Add environment variable `TF_CUDNN_DETERMINISTIC`. Setting to `TRUE` or \"1\" forces the selection of deterministic cuDNN convolution and max-pooling algorithms. When this is enabled, the algorithm selection procedure itself is also deterministic.\r\n> \r\n> ## Breaking Changes\r\n> * Many backwards incompatible API changes have been made to clean up the APIs and make them more consistent.\r\n> * Toolchains:\r\n>   * TensorFlow 2.0.0 is built using devtoolset7 (GCC7) on Ubuntu 16. This may lead to ABI incompatibilities with extensions built against earlier versions of TensorFlow.\r\n>   * Tensorflow code now produces 2 different pip packages: tensorflow_core containing all the code (in the future it will contain only the private implementation) and tensorflow which is a virtual pip package doing forwarding to tensorflow_core (and in the future will contain only the public API of tensorflow). We don't expect this to be breaking, unless you were importing directly from the implementation.\r\n>   Removed the `freeze_graph` command line tool; `SavedModel` should be used in place of frozen graphs.\r\n>   \r\n> * `tf.contrib`:\r\n>   * `tf.contrib` has been deprecated, and functionality has been either migrated to the core TensorFlow API, to an ecosystem project such as [tensorflow/addons](https://www.github.com/tensorflow/addons) or [tensorflow/io](https://www.github.com/tensorflow/io), or removed entirely.\r\n>   * Remove `tf.contrib.timeseries` dependency on TF distributions.\r\n>   * Replace contrib references with `tf.estimator.experimental.*` for apis in `early_stopping.py`.\r\n>   \r\n> * `tf.estimator`:\r\n>   * Premade estimators in the tf.estimator.DNN/Linear/DNNLinearCombined family have been updated to use `tf.keras.optimizers` instead of the `tf.compat.v1.train.Optimizer`s. If you do not pass in an `optimizer=` arg or if you use a string, the premade estimator will use the Keras optimizer. This is checkpoint breaking, as the optimizers have separate variables. A checkpoint converter tool for converting optimizers is included with the release,  but if you want to avoid any change, switch to the v1 version of the estimator:  `tf.compat.v1.estimator.DNN/Linear/DNNLinearCombined*`.\r\n>   * Default aggregation for canned Estimators is now `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE`. To maintain previous default behavior, please pass `SUM` as the loss aggregation method.\r\n>   * Canned Estimators don\u2019t support `input_layer_partitioner` arg in the API. If you have this arg, you will have to switch to `tf.compat.v1 canned Estimators`.\r\n></tr></table> ...

We have also released a collection of [tutorials and getting started guides](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta).\r\n> \r\n> ## Highlights\r\n> \r\n> * TF 2.0 delivers Keras as the central high level API used to build and train models. Keras provides several model-building APIs such as Sequential, Functional, and Subclassing along with eager execution, for immediate iteration and intuitive debugging, and `tf.data`, for building scalable input pipelines. Checkout [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/keras/overview) for additional details.\r\n> * Distribution Strategy: TF 2.0 users will be able to use the [`tf.distribute.Strategy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/distribute_strategy) API to distribute training with minimal code changes, yielding great out-of-the-box performance. It supports distributed training with Keras model.fit, as well as with custom training loops. Multi-GPU support is available, along with experimental support for multi worker and Cloud TPUs. Check out the [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/distribute_strategy) for more details.\r\n> * Functions, not Sessions. The traditional declarative programming model of building a graph and executing it via a `tf.Session` is discouraged, and replaced with by writing regular Python functions. Using the `tf.function` decorator, such functions can be turned into graphs which can be executed remotely, serialized, and optimized for performance.\r\n> * Unification of `tf.train.Optimizers` and `tf.keras.Optimizers`. Use `tf.keras.Optimizers` for TF2.0. `compute_gradients` is removed as public API, use `GradientTape` to compute gradients.\r\n> * AutoGraph translates Python control flow into TensorFlow expressions, allowing users to write regular Python inside `tf.function`-decorated functions. AutoGraph is also applied in functions used with tf.data, tf.distribute and tf.keras APIs. \r\n> * Unification of exchange formats to SavedModel. All TensorFlow ecosystem projects (TensorFlow Lite, TensorFlow JS, TensorFlow Serving, TensorFlow Hub) accept SavedModels. Model state should be saved to and restored from SavedModels.\r\n> * API Changes: Many API symbols have been renamed or removed, and argument names have changed. Many of these changes are motivated by consistency and clarity. The 1.x API remains available in the compat.v1 module. A list of all symbol changes can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FLFJLzg7WNP6JHODX5q8BDgptKafq_slHpnHVbJIteQ/edit#gid=0). \r\n>  * API clean-up, included removing `tf.app`, `tf.flags`, and `tf.logging` in favor of [absl-py](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-py).\r\n> * No more global variables with helper methods like `tf.global_variables_initializer` and `tf.get_global_step`.\r\n> * Add toggles `tf.enable_control_flow_v2()` and `tf.disable_control_flow_v2()` for enabling/disabling v2 control flow.\r\n> * Enable v2 control flow as part of `tf.enable_v2_behavior()` and `TF2_BEHAVIOR=1`.\r\n> * Fixes autocomplete for most TensorFlow API references by switching to use relative imports in API `__init__.py` files.\r\n> * Auto Mixed-Precision graph optimizer simplifies converting models to `float16` for acceleration on Volta and Turing Tensor Cores. This feature can be enabled by wrapping an optimizer class with `tf.train.experimental.enable_mixed_precision_graph_rewrite()`.\r\n> * Add environment variable `TF_CUDNN_DETERMINISTIC`. Setting to `TRUE` or \"1\" forces the selection of deterministic cuDNN convolution and max-pooling algorithms. When this is enabled, the algorithm selection procedure itself is also deterministic.\r\n> \r\n> ## Breaking Changes\r\n> * Many backwards incompatible API changes have been made to clean up the APIs and make them more consistent.\r\n> * Toolchains:\r\n>   * TensorFlow 2.0.0 is built using devtoolset7 (GCC7) on Ubuntu 16. This may lead to ABI incompatibilities with extensions built against earlier versions of TensorFlow.\r\n>   * Tensorflow code now produces 2 different pip packages: tensorflow_core containing all the code (in the future it will contain only the private implementation) and tensorflow which is a virtual pip package doing forwarding to tensorflow_core (and in the future will contain only the public API of tensorflow). We don't expect this to be breaking, unless you were importing directly from the implementation.\r\n>   Removed the `freeze_graph` command line tool; `SavedModel` should be used in place of frozen graphs.\r\n>   \r\n> * `tf.contrib`:\r\n>   * `tf.contrib` has been deprecated, and functionality has been either migrated to the core TensorFlow API, to an ecosystem project such as [tensorflow/addons](https://www.github.com/tensorflow/addons) or [tensorflow/io](https://www.github.com/tensorflow/io), or removed entirely.\r\n>   * Remove `tf.contrib.timeseries` dependency on TF distributions.\r\n>   * Replace contrib references with `tf.estimator.experimental.*` for apis in `early_stopping.py`.\r\n>   \r\n> * `tf.estimator`:\r\n>   * Premade estimators in the tf.estimator.DNN/Linear/DNNLinearCombined family have been updated to use `tf.keras.optimizers` instead of the `tf.compat.v1.train.Optimizer`s. If you do not pass in an `optimizer=` arg or if you use a string, the premade estimator will use the Keras optimizer. This is checkpoint breaking, as the optimizers have separate variables. A checkpoint converter tool for converting optimizers is included with the release,  but if you want to avoid any change, switch to the v1 version of the estimator:  `tf.compat.v1.estimator.DNN/Linear/DNNLinearCombined*`.\r\n>   * Default aggregation for canned Estimators is now `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE`. To maintain previous default behavior, please pass `SUM` as the loss aggregation method.\r\n>   * Canned Estimators don\u2019t support `input_layer_partitioner` arg in the API. If you have this arg, you will have to switch to `tf.compat.v1 canned Estimators`.\r\n></tr></table> ...

Check out the [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/distribute_strategy) for more details.\r\n> * Functions, not Sessions. The traditional declarative programming model of building a graph and executing it via a `tf.Session` is discouraged, and replaced with by writing regular Python functions. Using the `tf.function` decorator, such functions can be turned into graphs which can be executed remotely, serialized, and optimized for performance.\r\n> * Unification of `tf.train.Optimizers` and `tf.keras.Optimizers`. Use `tf.keras.Optimizers` for TF2.0. `compute_gradients` is removed as public API, use `GradientTape` to compute gradients.\r\n> * AutoGraph translates Python control flow into TensorFlow expressions, allowing users to write regular Python inside `tf.function`-decorated functions. AutoGraph is also applied in functions used with tf.data, tf.distribute and tf.keras APIs. \r\n> * Unification of exchange formats to SavedModel. All TensorFlow ecosystem projects (TensorFlow Lite, TensorFlow JS, TensorFlow Serving, TensorFlow Hub) accept SavedModels. Model state should be saved to and restored from SavedModels.\r\n> * API Changes: Many API symbols have been renamed or removed, and argument names have changed. Many of these changes are motivated by consistency and clarity. The 1.x API remains available in the compat.v1 module. A list of all symbol changes can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FLFJLzg7WNP6JHODX5q8BDgptKafq_slHpnHVbJIteQ/edit#gid=0). \r\n>  * API clean-up, included removing `tf.app`, `tf.flags`, and `tf.logging` in favor of [absl-py](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-py).\r\n> * No more global variables with helper methods like `tf.global_variables_initializer` and `tf.get_global_step`.\r\n> * Add toggles `tf.enable_control_flow_v2()` and `tf.disable_control_flow_v2()` for enabling/disabling v2 control flow.\r\n> * Enable v2 control flow as part of `tf.enable_v2_behavior()` and `TF2_BEHAVIOR=1`.\r\n> * Fixes autocomplete for most TensorFlow API references by switching to use relative imports in API `__init__.py` files.\r\n> * Auto Mixed-Precision graph optimizer simplifies converting models to `float16` for acceleration on Volta and Turing Tensor Cores. This feature can be enabled by wrapping an optimizer class with `tf.train.experimental.enable_mixed_precision_graph_rewrite()`.\r\n> * Add environment variable `TF_CUDNN_DETERMINISTIC`. Setting to `TRUE` or \"1\" forces the selection of deterministic cuDNN convolution and max-pooling algorithms. When this is enabled, the algorithm selection procedure itself is also deterministic.\r\n> \r\n> ## Breaking Changes\r\n> * Many backwards incompatible API changes have been made to clean up the APIs and make them more consistent.\r\n> * Toolchains:\r\n>   * TensorFlow 2.0.0 is built using devtoolset7 (GCC7) on Ubuntu 16. This may lead to ABI incompatibilities with extensions built against earlier versions of TensorFlow.\r\n>   * Tensorflow code now produces 2 different pip packages: tensorflow_core containing all the code (in the future it will contain only the private implementation) and tensorflow which is a virtual pip package doing forwarding to tensorflow_core (and in the future will contain only the public API of tensorflow). We don't expect this to be breaking, unless you were importing directly from the implementation.\r\n>   Removed the `freeze_graph` command line tool; `SavedModel` should be used in place of frozen graphs.\r\n>   \r\n> * `tf.contrib`:\r\n>   * `tf.contrib` has been deprecated, and functionality has been either migrated to the core TensorFlow API, to an ecosystem project such as [tensorflow/addons](https://www.github.com/tensorflow/addons) or [tensorflow/io](https://www.github.com/tensorflow/io), or removed entirely.\r\n>   * Remove `tf.contrib.timeseries` dependency on TF distributions.\r\n>   * Replace contrib references with `tf.estimator.experimental.*` for apis in `early_stopping.py`.\r\n>   \r\n> * `tf.estimator`:\r\n>   * Premade estimators in the tf.estimator.DNN/Linear/DNNLinearCombined family have been updated to use `tf.keras.optimizers` instead of the `tf.compat.v1.train.Optimizer`s. If you do not pass in an `optimizer=` arg or if you use a string, the premade estimator will use the Keras optimizer. This is checkpoint breaking, as the optimizers have separate variables. A checkpoint converter tool for converting optimizers is included with the release,  but if you want to avoid any change, switch to the v1 version of the estimator:  `tf.compat.v1.estimator.DNN/Linear/DNNLinearCombined*`.\r\n>   * Default aggregation for canned Estimators is now `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE`. To maintain previous default behavior, please pass `SUM` as the loss aggregation method.\r\n>   * Canned Estimators don\u2019t support `input_layer_partitioner` arg in the API. If you have this arg, you will have to switch to `tf.compat.v1 canned Estimators`.\r\n></tr></table> ...

We have also released a collection of [tutorials and getting started guides](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta).\r\n> \r\n> ## Highlights\r\n> \r\n> * TF 2.0 delivers Keras as the central high level API used to build and train models. Keras provides several model-building APIs such as Sequential, Functional, and Subclassing along with eager execution, for immediate iteration and intuitive debugging, and `tf.data`, for building scalable input pipelines. Checkout [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/keras/overview) for additional details.\r\n> * Distribution Strategy: TF 2.0 users will be able to use the [`tf.distribute.Strategy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/distribute_strategy) API to distribute training with minimal code changes, yielding great out-of-the-box performance. It supports distributed training with Keras model.fit, as well as with custom training loops. Multi-GPU support is available, along with experimental support for multi worker and Cloud TPUs. Check out the [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/distribute_strategy) for more details.\r\n> * Functions, not Sessions. The traditional declarative programming model of building a graph and executing it via a `tf.Session` is discouraged, and replaced with by writing regular Python functions. Using the `tf.function` decorator, such functions can be turned into graphs which can be executed remotely, serialized, and optimized for performance.\r\n> * Unification of `tf.train.Optimizers` and `tf.keras.Optimizers`. Use `tf.keras.Optimizers` for TF2.0. `compute_gradients` is removed as public API, use `GradientTape` to compute gradients.\r\n> * AutoGraph translates Python control flow into TensorFlow expressions, allowing users to write regular Python inside `tf.function`-decorated functions. AutoGraph is also applied in functions used with tf.data, tf.distribute and tf.keras APIs. \r\n> * Unification of exchange formats to SavedModel. All TensorFlow ecosystem projects (TensorFlow Lite, TensorFlow JS, TensorFlow Serving, TensorFlow Hub) accept SavedModels. Model state should be saved to and restored from SavedModels.\r\n> * API Changes: Many API symbols have been renamed or removed, and argument names have changed. Many of these changes are motivated by consistency and clarity. The 1.x API remains available in the compat.v1 module. A list of all symbol changes can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FLFJLzg7WNP6JHODX5q8BDgptKafq_slHpnHVbJIteQ/edit#gid=0). \r\n>  * API clean-up, included removing `tf.app`, `tf.flags`, and `tf.logging` in favor of [absl-py](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-py).\r\n> * No more global variables with helper methods like `tf.global_variables_initializer` and `tf.get_global_step`.\r\n> * Add toggles `tf.enable_control_flow_v2()` and `tf.disable_control_flow_v2()` for enabling/disabling v2 control flow.\r\n> * Enable v2 control flow as part of `tf.enable_v2_behavior()` and `TF2_BEHAVIOR=1`.\r\n> * Fixes autocomplete for most TensorFlow API references by switching to use relative imports in API `__init__.py` files.\r\n> * Auto Mixed-Precision graph optimizer simplifies converting models to `float16` for acceleration on Volta and Turing Tensor Cores. This feature can be enabled by wrapping an optimizer class with `tf.train.experimental.enable_mixed_precision_graph_rewrite()`.\r\n> * Add environment variable `TF_CUDNN_DETERMINISTIC`. Setting to `TRUE` or \"1\" forces the selection of deterministic cuDNN convolution and max-pooling algorithms. When this is enabled, the algorithm selection procedure itself is also deterministic.\r\n> \r\n> ## Breaking Changes\r\n> * Many backwards incompatible API changes have been made to clean up the APIs and make them more consistent.\r\n> * Toolchains:\r\n>   * TensorFlow 2.0.0 is built using devtoolset7 (GCC7) on Ubuntu 16. This may lead to ABI incompatibilities with extensions built against earlier versions of TensorFlow.\r\n>   * Tensorflow code now produces 2 different pip packages: tensorflow_core containing all the code (in the future it will contain only the private implementation) and tensorflow which is a virtual pip package doing forwarding to tensorflow_core (and in the future will contain only the public API of tensorflow). We don't expect this to be breaking, unless you were importing directly from the implementation.\r\n>   Removed the `freeze_graph` command line tool; `SavedModel` should be used in place of frozen graphs.\r\n>   \r\n> * `tf.contrib`:\r\n>   * `tf.contrib` has been deprecated, and functionality has been either migrated to the core TensorFlow API, to an ecosystem project such as [tensorflow/addons](https://www.github.com/tensorflow/addons) or [tensorflow/io](https://www.github.com/tensorflow/io), or removed entirely.\r\n>   * Remove `tf.contrib.timeseries` dependency on TF distributions.\r\n>   * Replace contrib references with `tf.estimator.experimental.*` for apis in `early_stopping.py`.\r\n>   \r\n> * `tf.estimator`:\r\n>   * Premade estimators in the tf.estimator.DNN/Linear/DNNLinearCombined family have been updated to use `tf.keras.optimizers` instead of the `tf.compat.v1.train.Optimizer`s. If you do not pass in an `optimizer=` arg or if you use a string, the premade estimator will use the Keras optimizer. This is checkpoint breaking, as the optimizers have separate variables. A checkpoint converter tool for converting optimizers is included with the release,  but if you want to avoid any change, switch to the v1 version of the estimator:  `tf.compat.v1.estimator.DNN/Linear/DNNLinearCombined*`.\r\n>   * Default aggregation for canned Estimators is now `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE`. To maintain previous default behavior, please pass `SUM` as the loss aggregation method.\r\n>   * Canned Estimators don\u2019t support `input_layer_partitioner` arg in the API. If you have this arg, you will have to switch to `tf.compat.v1 canned Estimators`.\r\n></tr></table> ... (truncated)\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n\n*Sourced from [tensorflow's changelog](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/RELEASE.md).*\n\n> # Release 2.0.0\n> \n> ## Major Features and Improvements\n> \n> TensorFlow 2.0 focuses on **simplicity** and **ease of use**, featuring updates like:\n> \n> * Easy model building with Keras and eager execution.\n> * Robust model deployment in production on any platform.\n> * Powerful experimentation for research.\n> * API simplification by reducing duplication and removing deprecated endpoints.\n> \n> For details on best practices with 2.0, see [the Effective 2.0 guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/effective_tf2)\n> \n> \n> For information on upgrading your existing TensorFlow 1.x models, please refer to our [Upgrade](https://medium.com/tensorflow/upgrading-your-code-to-tensorflow-2-0-f72c3a4d83b5) and [Migration](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/migration_guide) guides. We have also released a collection of [tutorials and getting started guides](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta).\n> \n> ## Highlights\n> \n> *   TF 2.0 delivers Keras as the central high level API used to build and train\n>     models. Keras provides several model-building APIs such as Sequential,\n>     Functional, and Subclassing along with eager execution, for immediate\n>     iteration and intuitive debugging, and `tf.data`, for building scalable\n>     input pipelines. Checkout\n>     [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/keras/overview) for additional\n>     details.\n> *   Distribution Strategy: TF 2.0 users will be able to use the\n>     [`tf.distribute.Strategy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/distribute_strategy)\n>     API to distribute training with minimal code changes, yielding great\n>     out-of-the-box performance. It supports distributed training with Keras\n>     model.fit, as well as with custom training loops. Multi-GPU support is\n>     available, along with experimental support for multi worker and Cloud TPUs.\n>     Check out the\n>     [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/distribute_strategy) for more\n>     details.\n> *   Functions, not Sessions. The traditional declarative programming model of\n>     building a graph and executing it via a `tf.Session` is discouraged, and\n>     replaced with by writing regular Python functions. Using the `tf.function`\n>     decorator, such functions can be turned into graphs which can be executed\n>     remotely, serialized, and optimized for performance.\n> *   Unification of `tf.train.Optimizers` and `tf.keras.Optimizers`. Use\n>     `tf.keras.Optimizers` for TF2.0. `compute_gradients` is removed as public\n>     API, use `GradientTape` to compute gradients.\n> *   AutoGraph translates Python control flow into TensorFlow expressions,\n>     allowing users to write regular Python inside `tf.function`-decorated\n>     functions. AutoGraph is also applied in functions used with tf.data,\n>     tf.distribute and tf.keras APIs.\n> *   Unification of exchange formats to SavedModel. All TensorFlow ecosystem\n>     projects (TensorFlow Lite, TensorFlow JS, TensorFlow Serving, TensorFlow\n>     Hub) accept SavedModels. Model state should be saved to and restored from\n>     SavedModels.\n></tr></table> ...

This is a bugfix; these ops were never meant to support integers.\r\n>   * Allow subslicing Tensors with a single dimension.                              \r\n>   * Add option to calculate string length in Unicode characters                    \r\n>   * Add functionality to SubSlice a tensor.                                        \r\n>   * Add searchsorted (ie lower/upper_bound) op.                                    \r\n>   * Add model explainability to Boosted Trees.                                     \r\n>   * Support negative positions for tf.substr                                       \r\n>   * There was previously a bug in the bijector_impl where the _reduce_jacobian_det_over_event does not handle scalar ILDJ implementations properly.\r\n>   * In tf eager execution, allow re-entering a GradientTape context                \r\n>   * Add tf_api_version flag. If --define=tf_api_version=2 flag is passed in, then bazel will build TensorFlow API version 2.0. Note that TensorFlow 2.0 is under active development and has no guarantees at this point.\r\n>   * Add additional compression options to TfRecordWriter                           \r\n>   * Performance improvements for regex full match operations.                      \r\n>   * Replace `tf.GraphKeys.VARIABLES` with `tf.GraphKeys.GLOBAL_VARIABLES`            \r\n>   * Remove unused dynamic learning rate support.                                   \r\n>                                                                                    \r\n> ## Thanks to our Contributors                                                      \r\n></tr></table> ...

This means that Python modules are under `tf.lite` and source code is now under `tensorflow/lite` rather than `tensorflow/contrib/lite`.\n> * TensorFlow GPU binaries are now built against CUDA 10 and TensorRT 5.0.\n> * Support for Python3.7 on all operating systems.\n> * Moved NCCL to core.\n> \n> ## Behavioral changes\n> \n> * Disallow conversion of python floating types to uint32/64 (matching behavior of other integer types) in `tf.constant`.\n> * Make the `gain` argument of convolutional orthogonal initializers (`convolutional_delta_orthogonal`, `convolutional_orthogonal_1D`, `convolutional_orthogonal_2D`, `convolutional_orthogonal_3D`) have consistent behavior with the `tf.initializers.orthogonal` initializer, i.e. scale the output l2-norm by `gain` and NOT by `sqrt(gain)`. (Note that these functions are currently in `tf.contrib` which is not guaranteed backward compatible).\n> \n> ## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n> \n> *   Documentation\n>     *   Update the doc with the details about the rounding mode used in\n>         quantize_and_dequantize_v2.\n>     *   Clarify that tensorflow::port::InitMain() _should_ be called before\n>         using the TensorFlow library. Programs failing to do this are not\n>         portable to all platforms.\n> *   Deprecations and Symbol renames.\n>     *   Removing deprecations for the following endpoints: `tf.acos`,\n>         `tf.acosh`, `tf.add`, `tf.as_string`, `tf.asin`, `tf.asinh`, `tf.atan`,\n>         `tf.atan2`, `tf.atanh`, `tf.cos`, `tf.cosh`, `tf.equal`, `tf.exp`,\n>         `tf.floor`, `tf.greater`, `tf.greater_equal`, `tf.less`,\n>         `tf.less_equal`, `tf.log`, `tf.logp1`, `tf.logical_and`,\n>         `tf.logical_not`, `tf.logical_or`, `tf.maximum`, `tf.minimum`,\n>         `tf.not_equal`, `tf.sin`, `tf.sinh`, `tf.tan`\n>     *   Deprecate `tf.data.Dataset.shard`.\n>     *   Deprecate `saved_model.loader.load` which is replaced by\n>         `saved_model.load` and `saved_model.main_op`, which will be replaced by\n>         `saved_model.main_op` in V2.\n>     *   Deprecate tf.QUANTIZED_DTYPES. The official new symbol is\n>         tf.dtypes.QUANTIZED_DTYPES.\n>     *   Update sklearn imports for deprecated packages.\n>     *   Deprecate `Variable.count_up_to` and `tf.count_up_to` in favor of\n>         `Dataset.range`.\n>     *   Export `confusion_matrix` op as `tf.math.confusion_matrix` instead of\n>         `tf.train.confusion_matrix`.\n>     *   Add `tf.dtypes.` endpoint for every constant in dtypes.py. Moving\n>         endpoints in versions.py to corresponding endpoints in `tf.sysconfig.`\n></tr></table> ...

This is a bugfix; these ops were never meant to support integers.\r\n>   * Allow subslicing Tensors with a single dimension.                              \r\n>   * Add option to calculate string length in Unicode characters                    \r\n>   * Add functionality to SubSlice a tensor.                                        \r\n>   * Add searchsorted (ie lower/upper_bound) op.                                    \r\n>   * Add model explainability to Boosted Trees.                                     \r\n>   * Support negative positions for tf.substr                                       \r\n>   * There was previously a bug in the bijector_impl where the _reduce_jacobian_det_over_event does not handle scalar ILDJ implementations properly.\r\n>   * In tf eager execution, allow re-entering a GradientTape context                \r\n>   * Add tf_api_version flag. If --define=tf_api_version=2 flag is passed in, then bazel will build TensorFlow API version 2.0. Note that TensorFlow 2.0 is under active development and has no guarantees at this point.\r\n>   * Add additional compression options to TfRecordWriter                           \r\n>   * Performance improvements for regex full match operations.                      \r\n>   * Replace `tf.GraphKeys.VARIABLES` with `tf.GraphKeys.GLOBAL_VARIABLES`            \r\n>   * Remove unused dynamic learning rate support.                                   \r\n>                                                                                    \r\n> ## Thanks to our Contributors                                                      \r\n></tr></table> ...

This means that Python modules are under `tf.lite` and source code is now under `tensorflow/lite` rather than `tensorflow/contrib/lite`.\n> * TensorFlow GPU binaries are now built against CUDA 10 and TensorRT 5.0.\n> * Support for Python3.7 on all operating systems.\n> * Moved NCCL to core.\n> \n> ## Behavioral changes\n> \n> * Disallow conversion of python floating types to uint32/64 (matching behavior of other integer types) in `tf.constant`.\n> * Make the `gain` argument of convolutional orthogonal initializers (`convolutional_delta_orthogonal`, `convolutional_orthogonal_1D`, `convolutional_orthogonal_2D`, `convolutional_orthogonal_3D`) have consistent behavior with the `tf.initializers.orthogonal` initializer, i.e. scale the output l2-norm by `gain` and NOT by `sqrt(gain)`. (Note that these functions are currently in `tf.contrib` which is not guaranteed backward compatible).\n> \n> ## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n> \n> *   Documentation\n>     *   Update the doc with the details about the rounding mode used in\n>         quantize_and_dequantize_v2.\n>     *   Clarify that tensorflow::port::InitMain() _should_ be called before\n>         using the TensorFlow library. Programs failing to do this are not\n>         portable to all platforms.\n> *   Deprecations and Symbol renames.\n>     *   Removing deprecations for the following endpoints: `tf.acos`,\n>         `tf.acosh`, `tf.add`, `tf.as_string`, `tf.asin`, `tf.asinh`, `tf.atan`,\n>         `tf.atan2`, `tf.atanh`, `tf.cos`, `tf.cosh`, `tf.equal`, `tf.exp`,\n>         `tf.floor`, `tf.greater`, `tf.greater_equal`, `tf.less`,\n>         `tf.less_equal`, `tf.log`, `tf.logp1`, `tf.logical_and`,\n>         `tf.logical_not`, `tf.logical_or`, `tf.maximum`, `tf.minimum`,\n>         `tf.not_equal`, `tf.sin`, `tf.sinh`, `tf.tan`\n>     *   Deprecate `tf.data.Dataset.shard`.\n>     *   Deprecate `saved_model.loader.load` which is replaced by\n>         `saved_model.load` and `saved_model.main_op`, which will be replaced by\n>         `saved_model.main_op` in V2.\n>     *   Deprecate tf.QUANTIZED_DTYPES. The official new symbol is\n>         tf.dtypes.QUANTIZED_DTYPES.\n>     *   Update sklearn imports for deprecated packages.\n>     *   Deprecate `Variable.count_up_to` and `tf.count_up_to` in favor of\n>         `Dataset.range`.\n>     *   Export `confusion_matrix` op as `tf.math.confusion_matrix` instead of\n>         `tf.train.confusion_matrix`.\n>     *   Add `tf.dtypes.` endpoint for every constant in dtypes.py. Moving\n>         endpoints in versions.py to corresponding endpoints in `tf.sysconfig.`\n></tr></table> ...

We have also released a collection of [tutorials and getting started guides](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta).\r\n> \r\n> ## Highlights\r\n> \r\n> * TF 2.0 delivers Keras as the central high level API used to build and train models. Keras provides several model-building APIs such as Sequential, Functional, and Subclassing along with eager execution, for immediate iteration and intuitive debugging, and `tf.data`, for building scalable input pipelines. Checkout [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/keras/overview) for additional details.\r\n> * Distribution Strategy: TF 2.0 users will be able to use the [`tf.distribute.Strategy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/distribute_strategy) API to distribute training with minimal code changes, yielding great out-of-the-box performance. It supports distributed training with Keras model.fit, as well as with custom training loops. Multi-GPU support is available, along with experimental support for multi worker and Cloud TPUs. Check out the [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/distribute_strategy) for more details.\r\n> * Functions, not Sessions. The traditional declarative programming model of building a graph and executing it via a `tf.Session` is discouraged, and replaced with by writing regular Python functions. Using the `tf.function` decorator, such functions can be turned into graphs which can be executed remotely, serialized, and optimized for performance.\r\n> * Unification of `tf.train.Optimizers` and `tf.keras.Optimizers`. Use `tf.keras.Optimizers` for TF2.0. `compute_gradients` is removed as public API, use `GradientTape` to compute gradients.\r\n> * AutoGraph translates Python control flow into TensorFlow expressions, allowing users to write regular Python inside `tf.function`-decorated functions. AutoGraph is also applied in functions used with tf.data, tf.distribute and tf.keras APIs. \r\n> * Unification of exchange formats to SavedModel. All TensorFlow ecosystem projects (TensorFlow Lite, TensorFlow JS, TensorFlow Serving, TensorFlow Hub) accept SavedModels. Model state should be saved to and restored from SavedModels.\r\n> * API Changes: Many API symbols have been renamed or removed, and argument names have changed. Many of these changes are motivated by consistency and clarity. The 1.x API remains available in the compat.v1 module. A list of all symbol changes can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FLFJLzg7WNP6JHODX5q8BDgptKafq_slHpnHVbJIteQ/edit#gid=0). \r\n>  * API clean-up, included removing `tf.app`, `tf.flags`, and `tf.logging` in favor of [absl-py](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-py).\r\n> * No more global variables with helper methods like `tf.global_variables_initializer` and `tf.get_global_step`.\r\n> * Add toggles `tf.enable_control_flow_v2()` and `tf.disable_control_flow_v2()` for enabling/disabling v2 control flow.\r\n> * Enable v2 control flow as part of `tf.enable_v2_behavior()` and `TF2_BEHAVIOR=1`.\r\n> * Fixes autocomplete for most TensorFlow API references by switching to use relative imports in API `__init__.py` files.\r\n> * Auto Mixed-Precision graph optimizer simplifies converting models to `float16` for acceleration on Volta and Turing Tensor Cores. This feature can be enabled by wrapping an optimizer class with `tf.train.experimental.enable_mixed_precision_graph_rewrite()`.\r\n> * Add environment variable `TF_CUDNN_DETERMINISTIC`. Setting to `TRUE` or \"1\" forces the selection of deterministic cuDNN convolution and max-pooling algorithms. When this is enabled, the algorithm selection procedure itself is also deterministic.\r\n> \r\n> ## Breaking Changes\r\n> * Many backwards incompatible API changes have been made to clean up the APIs and make them more consistent.\r\n> * Toolchains:\r\n>   * TensorFlow 2.0.0 is built using devtoolset7 (GCC7) on Ubuntu 16. This may lead to ABI incompatibilities with extensions built against earlier versions of TensorFlow.\r\n>   * Tensorflow code now produces 2 different pip packages: tensorflow_core containing all the code (in the future it will contain only the private implementation) and tensorflow which is a virtual pip package doing forwarding to tensorflow_core (and in the future will contain only the public API of tensorflow). We don't expect this to be breaking, unless you were importing directly from the implementation.\r\n>   Removed the `freeze_graph` command line tool; `SavedModel` should be used in place of frozen graphs.\r\n>   \r\n> * `tf.contrib`:\r\n>   * `tf.contrib` has been deprecated, and functionality has been either migrated to the core TensorFlow API, to an ecosystem project such as [tensorflow/addons](https://www.github.com/tensorflow/addons) or [tensorflow/io](https://www.github.com/tensorflow/io), or removed entirely.\r\n>   * Remove `tf.contrib.timeseries` dependency on TF distributions.\r\n>   * Replace contrib references with `tf.estimator.experimental.*` for apis in `early_stopping.py`.\r\n>   \r\n> * `tf.estimator`:\r\n>   * Premade estimators in the tf.estimator.DNN/Linear/DNNLinearCombined family have been updated to use `tf.keras.optimizers` instead of the `tf.compat.v1.train.Optimizer`s. If you do not pass in an `optimizer=` arg or if you use a string, the premade estimator will use the Keras optimizer. This is checkpoint breaking, as the optimizers have separate variables. A checkpoint converter tool for converting optimizers is included with the release,  but if you want to avoid any change, switch to the v1 version of the estimator:  `tf.compat.v1.estimator.DNN/Linear/DNNLinearCombined*`.\r\n>   * Default aggregation for canned Estimators is now `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE`. To maintain previous default behavior, please pass `SUM` as the loss aggregation method.\r\n>   * Canned Estimators don\u2019t support `input_layer_partitioner` arg in the API. If you have this arg, you will have to switch to `tf.compat.v1 canned Estimators`.\r\n></tr></table> ...

We have also released a collection of [tutorials and getting started guides](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta).\r\n> \r\n> ## Highlights\r\n> \r\n> * TF 2.0 delivers Keras as the central high level API used to build and train models. Keras provides several model-building APIs such as Sequential, Functional, and Subclassing along with eager execution, for immediate iteration and intuitive debugging, and `tf.data`, for building scalable input pipelines. Checkout [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/keras/overview) for additional details.\r\n> * Distribution Strategy: TF 2.0 users will be able to use the [`tf.distribute.Strategy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/distribute_strategy) API to distribute training with minimal code changes, yielding great out-of-the-box performance. It supports distributed training with Keras model.fit, as well as with custom training loops. Multi-GPU support is available, along with experimental support for multi worker and Cloud TPUs. Check out the [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/distribute_strategy) for more details.\r\n> * Functions, not Sessions. The traditional declarative programming model of building a graph and executing it via a `tf.Session` is discouraged, and replaced with by writing regular Python functions. Using the `tf.function` decorator, such functions can be turned into graphs which can be executed remotely, serialized, and optimized for performance.\r\n> * Unification of `tf.train.Optimizers` and `tf.keras.Optimizers`. Use `tf.keras.Optimizers` for TF2.0. `compute_gradients` is removed as public API, use `GradientTape` to compute gradients.\r\n> * AutoGraph translates Python control flow into TensorFlow expressions, allowing users to write regular Python inside `tf.function`-decorated functions. AutoGraph is also applied in functions used with tf.data, tf.distribute and tf.keras APIs. \r\n> * Unification of exchange formats to SavedModel. All TensorFlow ecosystem projects (TensorFlow Lite, TensorFlow JS, TensorFlow Serving, TensorFlow Hub) accept SavedModels. Model state should be saved to and restored from SavedModels.\r\n> * API Changes: Many API symbols have been renamed or removed, and argument names have changed. Many of these changes are motivated by consistency and clarity. The 1.x API remains available in the compat.v1 module. A list of all symbol changes can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FLFJLzg7WNP6JHODX5q8BDgptKafq_slHpnHVbJIteQ/edit#gid=0). \r\n>  * API clean-up, included removing `tf.app`, `tf.flags`, and `tf.logging` in favor of [absl-py](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-py).\r\n> * No more global variables with helper methods like `tf.global_variables_initializer` and `tf.get_global_step`.\r\n> * Add toggles `tf.enable_control_flow_v2()` and `tf.disable_control_flow_v2()` for enabling/disabling v2 control flow.\r\n> * Enable v2 control flow as part of `tf.enable_v2_behavior()` and `TF2_BEHAVIOR=1`.\r\n> * Fixes autocomplete for most TensorFlow API references by switching to use relative imports in API `__init__.py` files.\r\n> * Auto Mixed-Precision graph optimizer simplifies converting models to `float16` for acceleration on Volta and Turing Tensor Cores. This feature can be enabled by wrapping an optimizer class with `tf.train.experimental.enable_mixed_precision_graph_rewrite()`.\r\n> * Add environment variable `TF_CUDNN_DETERMINISTIC`. Setting to `TRUE` or \"1\" forces the selection of deterministic cuDNN convolution and max-pooling algorithms. When this is enabled, the algorithm selection procedure itself is also deterministic.\r\n> \r\n> ## Breaking Changes\r\n> * Many backwards incompatible API changes have been made to clean up the APIs and make them more consistent.\r\n> * Toolchains:\r\n>   * TensorFlow 2.0.0 is built using devtoolset7 (GCC7) on Ubuntu 16. This may lead to ABI incompatibilities with extensions built against earlier versions of TensorFlow.\r\n>   * Tensorflow code now produces 2 different pip packages: tensorflow_core containing all the code (in the future it will contain only the private implementation) and tensorflow which is a virtual pip package doing forwarding to tensorflow_core (and in the future will contain only the public API of tensorflow). We don't expect this to be breaking, unless you were importing directly from the implementation.\r\n>   Removed the `freeze_graph` command line tool; `SavedModel` should be used in place of frozen graphs.\r\n>   \r\n> * `tf.contrib`:\r\n>   * `tf.contrib` has been deprecated, and functionality has been either migrated to the core TensorFlow API, to an ecosystem project such as [tensorflow/addons](https://www.github.com/tensorflow/addons) or [tensorflow/io](https://www.github.com/tensorflow/io), or removed entirely.\r\n>   * Remove `tf.contrib.timeseries` dependency on TF distributions.\r\n>   * Replace contrib references with `tf.estimator.experimental.*` for apis in `early_stopping.py`.\r\n>   \r\n> * `tf.estimator`:\r\n>   * Premade estimators in the tf.estimator.DNN/Linear/DNNLinearCombined family have been updated to use `tf.keras.optimizers` instead of the `tf.compat.v1.train.Optimizer`s. If you do not pass in an `optimizer=` arg or if you use a string, the premade estimator will use the Keras optimizer. This is checkpoint breaking, as the optimizers have separate variables. A checkpoint converter tool for converting optimizers is included with the release,  but if you want to avoid any change, switch to the v1 version of the estimator:  `tf.compat.v1.estimator.DNN/Linear/DNNLinearCombined*`.\r\n>   * Default aggregation for canned Estimators is now `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE`. To maintain previous default behavior, please pass `SUM` as the loss aggregation method.\r\n>   * Canned Estimators don\u2019t support `input_layer_partitioner` arg in the API. If you have this arg, you will have to switch to `tf.compat.v1 canned Estimators`.\r\n></tr></table> ...

If --define=tf_api_version=2 flag is passed in, then bazel will build TensorFlow API version 2.0. Note that TensorFlow 2.0 is under active development and has no guarantees at this point.\r\n>   * Add additional compression options to TfRecordWriter                           \r\n>   * Performance improvements for regex full match operations.                      \r\n>   * Replace `tf.GraphKeys.VARIABLES` with `tf.GraphKeys.GLOBAL_VARIABLES`            \r\n>   * Remove unused dynamic learning rate support.                                   \r\n>                                                                                    \r\n> ## Thanks to our Contributors                                                      \r\n></tr></table> ...

This means that Python modules are under `tf.lite` and source code is now under `tensorflow/lite` rather than `tensorflow/contrib/lite`.\n> * TensorFlow GPU binaries are now built against CUDA 10 and TensorRT 5.0.\n> * Support for Python3.7 on all operating systems.\n> * Moved NCCL to core.\n> \n> ## Behavioral changes\n> \n> * Disallow conversion of python floating types to uint32/64 (matching behavior of other integer types) in `tf.constant`.\n> * Make the `gain` argument of convolutional orthogonal initializers (`convolutional_delta_orthogonal`, `convolutional_orthogonal_1D`, `convolutional_orthogonal_2D`, `convolutional_orthogonal_3D`) have consistent behavior with the `tf.initializers.orthogonal` initializer, i.e. scale the output l2-norm by `gain` and NOT by `sqrt(gain)`. (Note that these functions are currently in `tf.contrib` which is not guaranteed backward compatible).\n> \n> ## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n> \n> *   Documentation\n>     *   Update the doc with the details about the rounding mode used in\n>         quantize_and_dequantize_v2.\n>     *   Clarify that tensorflow::port::InitMain() _should_ be called before\n>         using the TensorFlow library. Programs failing to do this are not\n>         portable to all platforms.\n> *   Deprecations and Symbol renames.\n>     *   Removing deprecations for the following endpoints: `tf.acos`,\n>         `tf.acosh`, `tf.add`, `tf.as_string`, `tf.asin`, `tf.asinh`, `tf.atan`,\n>         `tf.atan2`, `tf.atanh`, `tf.cos`, `tf.cosh`, `tf.equal`, `tf.exp`,\n>         `tf.floor`, `tf.greater`, `tf.greater_equal`, `tf.less`,\n>         `tf.less_equal`, `tf.log`, `tf.logp1`, `tf.logical_and`,\n>         `tf.logical_not`, `tf.logical_or`, `tf.maximum`, `tf.minimum`,\n>         `tf.not_equal`, `tf.sin`, `tf.sinh`, `tf.tan`\n>     *   Deprecate `tf.data.Dataset.shard`.\n>     *   Deprecate `saved_model.loader.load` which is replaced by\n>         `saved_model.load` and `saved_model.main_op`, which will be replaced by\n>         `saved_model.main_op` in V2.\n>     *   Deprecate tf.QUANTIZED_DTYPES. The official new symbol is\n>         tf.dtypes.QUANTIZED_DTYPES.\n>     *   Update sklearn imports for deprecated packages.\n>     *   Deprecate `Variable.count_up_to` and `tf.count_up_to` in favor of\n>         `Dataset.range`.\n>     *   Export `confusion_matrix` op as `tf.math.confusion_matrix` instead of\n>         `tf.train.confusion_matrix`.\n>     *   Add `tf.dtypes.` endpoint for every constant in dtypes.py. Moving\n>         endpoints in versions.py to corresponding endpoints in `tf.sysconfig.`\n></tr></table> ...

If --define=tf_api_version=2 flag is passed in, then bazel will build TensorFlow API version 2.0. Note that TensorFlow 2.0 is under active development and has no guarantees at this point.\r\n>   * Add additional compression options to TfRecordWriter                           \r\n>   * Performance improvements for regex full match operations.                      \r\n>   * Replace `tf.GraphKeys.VARIABLES` with `tf.GraphKeys.GLOBAL_VARIABLES`            \r\n>   * Remove unused dynamic learning rate support.                                   \r\n>                                                                                    \r\n> ## Thanks to our Contributors                                                      \r\n></tr></table> ...

This means that Python modules are under `tf.lite` and source code is now under `tensorflow/lite` rather than `tensorflow/contrib/lite`.\n> * TensorFlow GPU binaries are now built against CUDA 10 and TensorRT 5.0.\n> * Support for Python3.7 on all operating systems.\n> * Moved NCCL to core.\n> \n> ## Behavioral changes\n> \n> * Disallow conversion of python floating types to uint32/64 (matching behavior of other integer types) in `tf.constant`.\n> * Make the `gain` argument of convolutional orthogonal initializers (`convolutional_delta_orthogonal`, `convolutional_orthogonal_1D`, `convolutional_orthogonal_2D`, `convolutional_orthogonal_3D`) have consistent behavior with the `tf.initializers.orthogonal` initializer, i.e. scale the output l2-norm by `gain` and NOT by `sqrt(gain)`. (Note that these functions are currently in `tf.contrib` which is not guaranteed backward compatible).\n> \n> ## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n> \n> *   Documentation\n>     *   Update the doc with the details about the rounding mode used in\n>         quantize_and_dequantize_v2.\n>     *   Clarify that tensorflow::port::InitMain() _should_ be called before\n>         using the TensorFlow library. Programs failing to do this are not\n>         portable to all platforms.\n> *   Deprecations and Symbol renames.\n>     *   Removing deprecations for the following endpoints: `tf.acos`,\n>         `tf.acosh`, `tf.add`, `tf.as_string`, `tf.asin`, `tf.asinh`, `tf.atan`,\n>         `tf.atan2`, `tf.atanh`, `tf.cos`, `tf.cosh`, `tf.equal`, `tf.exp`,\n>         `tf.floor`, `tf.greater`, `tf.greater_equal`, `tf.less`,\n>         `tf.less_equal`, `tf.log`, `tf.logp1`, `tf.logical_and`,\n>         `tf.logical_not`, `tf.logical_or`, `tf.maximum`, `tf.minimum`,\n>         `tf.not_equal`, `tf.sin`, `tf.sinh`, `tf.tan`\n>     *   Deprecate `tf.data.Dataset.shard`.\n>     *   Deprecate `saved_model.loader.load` which is replaced by\n>         `saved_model.load` and `saved_model.main_op`, which will be replaced by\n>         `saved_model.main_op` in V2.\n>     *   Deprecate tf.QUANTIZED_DTYPES. The official new symbol is\n>         tf.dtypes.QUANTIZED_DTYPES.\n>     *   Update sklearn imports for deprecated packages.\n>     *   Deprecate `Variable.count_up_to` and `tf.count_up_to` in favor of\n>         `Dataset.range`.\n>     *   Export `confusion_matrix` op as `tf.math.confusion_matrix` instead of\n>         `tf.train.confusion_matrix`.\n>     *   Add `tf.dtypes.` endpoint for every constant in dtypes.py. Moving\n>         endpoints in versions.py to corresponding endpoints in `tf.sysconfig.`\n></tr></table> ...

If --define=tf_api_version=2 flag is passed in, then bazel will build TensorFlow API version 2.0.

This means that Python modules are under `tf.lite` and source code is now under `tensorflow/lite` rather than `tensorflow/contrib/lite`.\n> * TensorFlow GPU binaries are now built against CUDA 10 and TensorRT 5.0.\n> * Support for Python3.7 on all operating systems.\n> * Moved NCCL to core.\n> \n> ## Behavioral changes\n> \n> * Disallow conversion of python floating types to uint32/64 (matching behavior of other integer types) in `tf.constant`.\n> * Make the `gain` argument of convolutional orthogonal initializers (`convolutional_delta_orthogonal`, `convolutional_orthogonal_1D`, `convolutional_orthogonal_2D`, `convolutional_orthogonal_3D`) have consistent behavior with the `tf.initializers.orthogonal` initializer, i.e. scale the output l2-norm by `gain` and NOT by `sqrt(gain)`. (Note that these functions are currently in `tf.contrib` which is not guaranteed backward compatible).\n> \n> ## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n> \n> *   Documentation\n>     *   Update the doc with the details about the rounding mode used in\n>         quantize_and_dequantize_v2.\n>     *   Clarify that tensorflow::port::InitMain() _should_ be called before\n>         using the TensorFlow library. Programs failing to do this are not\n>         portable to all platforms.\n> *   Deprecations and Symbol renames.\n>     *   Removing deprecations for the following endpoints: `tf.acos`,\n>         `tf.acosh`, `tf.add`, `tf.as_string`, `tf.asin`, `tf.asinh`, `tf.atan`,\n>         `tf.atan2`, `tf.atanh`, `tf.cos`, `tf.cosh`, `tf.equal`, `tf.exp`,\n>         `tf.floor`, `tf.greater`, `tf.greater_equal`, `tf.less`,\n>         `tf.less_equal`, `tf.log`, `tf.logp1`, `tf.logical_and`,\n>         `tf.logical_not`, `tf.logical_or`, `tf.maximum`, `tf.minimum`,\n>         `tf.not_equal`, `tf.sin`, `tf.sinh`, `tf.tan`\n>     *   Deprecate `tf.data.Dataset.shard`.\n>     *   Deprecate `saved_model.loader.load` which is replaced by\n>         `saved_model.load` and `saved_model.main_op`, which will be replaced by\n>         `saved_model.main_op` in V2.\n>     *   Deprecate tf.QUANTIZED_DTYPES. The official new symbol is\n>         tf.dtypes.QUANTIZED_DTYPES.\n>     *   Update sklearn imports for deprecated packages.\n>     *   Deprecate `Variable.count_up_to` and `tf.count_up_to` in favor of\n>         `Dataset.range`.\n>     *   Export `confusion_matrix` op as `tf.math.confusion_matrix` instead of\n>         `tf.train.confusion_matrix`.\n>     *   Add `tf.dtypes.` endpoint for every constant in dtypes.py. Moving\n>         endpoints in versions.py to corresponding endpoints in `tf.sysconfig.`\n></tr></table> ...

Catching a ValueError exception thrown by `tf.contrib.get_signature_def_by_key` should be replaced by catching a KeyError exception.\r\n> * `tf.contrib.data`                                                                \r\n>   * Deprecate, and replace by tf.data.experimental.                                \r\n> * Other:                                                                           \r\n>   * Improved XLA stability and performance.\r\n>   * Fix single replica TensorBoard summary stats in Cloud ML Engine.\r\n>   * TPUEstimator: Initialize dataset iterators in parallel.\r\n>   * Keras on TPU model quality and bug fixes.\r\n>   * Instead of jemalloc, revert back to using system malloc since it simplifies build and has comparable performance.\r\n>   * Remove integer types from `tf.nn.softplus` and `tf.nn.softsign` OpDefs. This is a bugfix; these ops were never meant to support integers.\r\n>   * Allow subslicing Tensors with a single dimension.                              \r\n>   * Add option to calculate string length in Unicode characters                    \r\n>   * Add functionality to SubSlice a tensor.                                        \r\n>   * Add searchsorted (ie lower/upper_bound) op.                                    \r\n>   * Add model explainability to Boosted Trees.                                     \r\n>   * Support negative positions for tf.substr                                       \r\n>   * There was previously a bug in the bijector_impl where the _reduce_jacobian_det_over_event does not handle scalar ILDJ implementations properly.\r\n>   * In tf eager execution, allow re-entering a GradientTape context                \r\n>   * Add tf_api_version flag. If --define=tf_api_version=2 flag is passed in, then bazel will build TensorFlow API version 2.0. Note that TensorFlow 2.0 is under active development and has no guarantees at this point.\r\n>   * Add additional compression options to TfRecordWriter                           \r\n>   * Performance improvements for regex full match operations.                      \r\n>   * Replace `tf.GraphKeys.VARIABLES` with `tf.GraphKeys.GLOBAL_VARIABLES`            \r\n>   * Remove unused dynamic learning rate support.                                   \r\n>                                                                                    \r\n> ## Thanks to our Contributors                                                      \r\n></tr></table> ...

This means that Python modules are under `tf.lite` and source code is now under `tensorflow/lite` rather than `tensorflow/contrib/lite`.\n> * TensorFlow GPU binaries are now built against CUDA 10 and TensorRT 5.0.\n> * Support for Python3.7 on all operating systems.\n> * Moved NCCL to core.\n> \n> ## Behavioral changes\n> \n> * Disallow conversion of python floating types to uint32/64 (matching behavior of other integer types) in `tf.constant`.\n> * Make the `gain` argument of convolutional orthogonal initializers (`convolutional_delta_orthogonal`, `convolutional_orthogonal_1D`, `convolutional_orthogonal_2D`, `convolutional_orthogonal_3D`) have consistent behavior with the `tf.initializers.orthogonal` initializer, i.e. scale the output l2-norm by `gain` and NOT by `sqrt(gain)`. (Note that these functions are currently in `tf.contrib` which is not guaranteed backward compatible).\n> \n> ## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n> \n> *   Documentation\n>     *   Update the doc with the details about the rounding mode used in\n>         quantize_and_dequantize_v2.\n>     *   Clarify that tensorflow::port::InitMain() _should_ be called before\n>         using the TensorFlow library. Programs failing to do this are not\n>         portable to all platforms.\n> *   Deprecations and Symbol renames.\n>     *   Removing deprecations for the following endpoints: `tf.acos`,\n>         `tf.acosh`, `tf.add`, `tf.as_string`, `tf.asin`, `tf.asinh`, `tf.atan`,\n>         `tf.atan2`, `tf.atanh`, `tf.cos`, `tf.cosh`, `tf.equal`, `tf.exp`,\n>         `tf.floor`, `tf.greater`, `tf.greater_equal`, `tf.less`,\n>         `tf.less_equal`, `tf.log`, `tf.logp1`, `tf.logical_and`,\n>         `tf.logical_not`, `tf.logical_or`, `tf.maximum`, `tf.minimum`,\n>         `tf.not_equal`, `tf.sin`, `tf.sinh`, `tf.tan`\n>     *   Deprecate `tf.data.Dataset.shard`.\n>     *   Deprecate `saved_model.loader.load` which is replaced by\n>         `saved_model.load` and `saved_model.main_op`, which will be replaced by\n>         `saved_model.main_op` in V2.\n>     *   Deprecate tf.QUANTIZED_DTYPES. The official new symbol is\n>         tf.dtypes.QUANTIZED_DTYPES.\n>     *   Update sklearn imports for deprecated packages.\n>     *   Deprecate `Variable.count_up_to` and `tf.count_up_to` in favor of\n>         `Dataset.range`.\n>     *   Export `confusion_matrix` op as `tf.math.confusion_matrix` instead of\n>         `tf.train.confusion_matrix`.\n>     *   Add `tf.dtypes.` endpoint for every constant in dtypes.py. Moving\n>         endpoints in versions.py to corresponding endpoints in `tf.sysconfig.`\n></tr></table> ...

Catching a ValueError exception thrown by `tf.contrib.get_signature_def_by_key` should be replaced by catching a KeyError exception.\r\n> * `tf.contrib.data`                                                                \r\n>   * Deprecate, and replace by tf.data.experimental.                                \r\n> * Other:                                                                           \r\n>   * Improved XLA stability and performance.\r\n>   * Fix single replica TensorBoard summary stats in Cloud ML Engine.\r\n>   * TPUEstimator: Initialize dataset iterators in parallel.\r\n>   * Keras on TPU model quality and bug fixes.\r\n>   * Instead of jemalloc, revert back to using system malloc since it simplifies build and has comparable performance.\r\n>   * Remove integer types from `tf.nn.softplus` and `tf.nn.softsign` OpDefs. This is a bugfix; these ops were never meant to support integers.\r\n>   * Allow subslicing Tensors with a single dimension.                              \r\n>   * Add option to calculate string length in Unicode characters                    \r\n>   * Add functionality to SubSlice a tensor.                                        \r\n>   * Add searchsorted (ie lower/upper_bound) op.                                    \r\n>   * Add model explainability to Boosted Trees.                                     \r\n>   * Support negative positions for tf.substr                                       \r\n>   * There was previously a bug in the bijector_impl where the _reduce_jacobian_det_over_event does not handle scalar ILDJ implementations properly.\r\n>   * In tf eager execution, allow re-entering a GradientTape context                \r\n>   * Add tf_api_version flag. If --define=tf_api_version=2 flag is passed in, then bazel will build TensorFlow API version 2.0. Note that TensorFlow 2.0 is under active development and has no guarantees at this point.\r\n>   * Add additional compression options to TfRecordWriter                           \r\n>   * Performance improvements for regex full match operations.                      \r\n>   * Replace `tf.GraphKeys.VARIABLES` with `tf.GraphKeys.GLOBAL_VARIABLES`            \r\n>   * Remove unused dynamic learning rate support.                                   \r\n>                                                                                    \r\n> ## Thanks to our Contributors                                                      \r\n></tr></table> ...

This means that Python modules are under `tf.lite` and source code is now under `tensorflow/lite` rather than `tensorflow/contrib/lite`.\n> * TensorFlow GPU binaries are now built against CUDA 10 and TensorRT 5.0.\n> * Support for Python3.7 on all operating systems.\n> * Moved NCCL to core.\n> \n> ## Behavioral changes\n> \n> * Disallow conversion of python floating types to uint32/64 (matching behavior of other integer types) in `tf.constant`.\n> * Make the `gain` argument of convolutional orthogonal initializers (`convolutional_delta_orthogonal`, `convolutional_orthogonal_1D`, `convolutional_orthogonal_2D`, `convolutional_orthogonal_3D`) have consistent behavior with the `tf.initializers.orthogonal` initializer, i.e. scale the output l2-norm by `gain` and NOT by `sqrt(gain)`. (Note that these functions are currently in `tf.contrib` which is not guaranteed backward compatible).\n> \n> ## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n> \n> *   Documentation\n>     *   Update the doc with the details about the rounding mode used in\n>         quantize_and_dequantize_v2.\n>     *   Clarify that tensorflow::port::InitMain() _should_ be called before\n>         using the TensorFlow library. Programs failing to do this are not\n>         portable to all platforms.\n> *   Deprecations and Symbol renames.\n>     *   Removing deprecations for the following endpoints: `tf.acos`,\n>         `tf.acosh`, `tf.add`, `tf.as_string`, `tf.asin`, `tf.asinh`, `tf.atan`,\n>         `tf.atan2`, `tf.atanh`, `tf.cos`, `tf.cosh`, `tf.equal`, `tf.exp`,\n>         `tf.floor`, `tf.greater`, `tf.greater_equal`, `tf.less`,\n>         `tf.less_equal`, `tf.log`, `tf.logp1`, `tf.logical_and`,\n>         `tf.logical_not`, `tf.logical_or`, `tf.maximum`, `tf.minimum`,\n>         `tf.not_equal`, `tf.sin`, `tf.sinh`, `tf.tan`\n>     *   Deprecate `tf.data.Dataset.shard`.\n>     *   Deprecate `saved_model.loader.load` which is replaced by\n>         `saved_model.load` and `saved_model.main_op`, which will be replaced by\n>         `saved_model.main_op` in V2.\n>     *   Deprecate tf.QUANTIZED_DTYPES. The official new symbol is\n>         tf.dtypes.QUANTIZED_DTYPES.\n>     *   Update sklearn imports for deprecated packages.\n>     *   Deprecate `Variable.count_up_to` and `tf.count_up_to` in favor of\n>         `Dataset.range`.\n>     *   Export `confusion_matrix` op as `tf.math.confusion_matrix` instead of\n>         `tf.train.confusion_matrix`.\n>     *   Add `tf.dtypes.` endpoint for every constant in dtypes.py. Moving\n>         endpoints in versions.py to corresponding endpoints in `tf.sysconfig.`\n></tr></table> ...
