This will make it not look weird if someone is committing a file for the first time or does not want to include a changelog.  I also put in some functions to parse and read any old README (if it exists) such that the change log will be a running list of all versions of the file that a user has uploaded.\n\nAlso, there is no need to require the user to input their github username to the component since I can find out what their username is through the config file in the .git folder of their fork on their computer.  Generally, I want to try to make as few required inputs as possible since I could tell that this was a big barrier to entry for new people just trying out the component.\n\nAlong the line of the user's account name, I also put in a link to the user's account in the README so that people can go from the hydra page to the user's page if they want to access all of the example files that someone has uploaded (if you have any easy way of generating this page, I think that a lot of people will want quick access to it).\n\nLet me know if I am forgetting anything and, if not, close out the issue!\n\n-Chris\n"

Firefox is just a black window that i can't even refresh. Everything is disabled.\n![capture](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7526023/10201149/33fe15de-67b3-11e5-8d71-bc3630386626.JPG)\n\nThanks,\n-A.\n"

They still support the old schema from Grasshopper but you will see a warning that the example is generated by an older version of Hydra.\n\nBack to images [this example](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=mostaphaRoudsari&fork=hydra_1&id=shadow_range_study) might help to make it clear. As you can see now you can document your example with more than Rhino and Grasshopper images. Think as a Hydra page like a blog post. You may have some images prepared for a specific purpose. I think you should be able to have them included in Hydra. Also not all the example files will be generated from Rhino and Grasshopper. That's why I changed the field to images to keep it generic and compatible with other platforms.\n\nLet me know if it looks good to you and we can close this issue.\n"

        "body": "@chriswmackey. Thanks. It's not about the file names but the file structure. I left the naming as what it used to be, but what is different between the previous structure and the current one is that all the images are under input.images - They can be named whatever that you want as far as they are available in the folder. In the other word there is no Rhino vs GH images. There are just couple of images.\n\nGood point! There is no naming schema and first image will show up first. I think that's a fair point and we can change the schema to follow an order for images. Something like:\n\n``` javascript\n\"images\" : {     /* \n                        image full name : optional description\n                        First image will be loaded by default. All the images should be\n                        located in the root folder\n                        */\n                       \"0\" : { \"image1.jpg\" : \"Grasshopper definition\"},\n                        \"1\": {\"image2.gif\": \"Animated Rhino Scene\"},\n                        \"2\": {\"image3.png\": \"Dynamo definition\"},\n                         \"3\": {\"Image4.tiff\": \"\"}, ...\n                   },\n```\n\nor it can be simply a list of objects which will be in order. I can implement this change later tonight. It needs changes also in the front end.\n"

To drive home my only major suggestions if we want people to use this feature: we should make it clear to them that the images should be in the folder BEFORE running the Hydra component and that the order of images that they want should follow a naming convention.\n\nAlso, how do you feel about having the GH script as the first image by default (unless people edit the json file)?  This sounds like a good means of shaping a general structure to the Hydra database while still allowing people to freedom to over-ride it (if they know what they are doing and edit the json).\n\n-Chris\n"

Can we have different discussion/commenting for the same page with different hashes?\nI'm going to modify the code to use pushState or location.hash for different users.
