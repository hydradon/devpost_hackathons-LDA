We need to figure out why thats so big. I notice it is small on your screen, yet very very large on both Alexis' and my computer screens.\n\nThe homepage \"Need some help? Click me!\"... Could that be a button like the \"Open Folder\" button on the left sidebar? I think it would look cleaner (think Slack type appearance)\n"
