        "body": "Hi, sorry I'm just seeing this; Because lambda doesn't allow you to open TCP connections, we had to use our own web hook server. There was also issues with the firewall in my lab so the networking got even more complicated from there. The intent schema was use to extract the info from the echo, then Amazon would send the data to our server, then our server would send the data to one of our lab machines over UDP, then the turtlebot connected to the lab machine over a reverse TCP connection (again university firewall weirdness). So once we had the data on the turtlebot we could decode it and tell the turtlebot how to move (the motion.py code and tcpitl.py code)."

        "body": "Hi @bashawhm . I am also trying to follow your instruction and get our Amazon skill to communicate to our local server. However, it is not clear to me how to set up the Endpoint under Configuration on the Alexa skill. I am guessing you are providing an HTTPS address to your local server with a specific port. Let's say if my static ip is 100.100.100.100 and I've already made the port 1111 open, then would the HTTPS address be like: \r\nhttps://100.100.100.100:1111 \r\n\r\n- Do you provide an SSL Certificate to the Amazon skill to authenticate the connection between Alexa skill and the local server?\r\n\r\n- On the local server, do you run rosbridge_websocket as your reverse TCP connection?  \r\n\r\nI would appreciate any hints on the above questions.

        "body": "Hi!\r\nI don't remember if you have to provide the certificate to amazon or not (I think you do though). However it does need to be an HTTPS server (You can sign your own SSL certificate though which is fun). \r\nAs for the TCP connection we just used normal UNIX sockets( the python socket library). We did this in the TCPITL.py file. From there we subscribed to that node from the motion.py node (You can see this subscription in the motion.py file (\"\"rospy.Subscriber(\"TCPITL\", String, callback)\"\"). \r\nNote: we only needed to use a reverse connection because our campus's firewall didn't allow for any inbound TCP connections (For example: the connection between the ITL machine and the turtlebot), only outbound ones; Meaning that the turtlebot had to instantiate the connection."
