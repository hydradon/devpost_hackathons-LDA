For a rigid body, if the current position is in an unmovable material (i.e. a wall), the function fails. So we just change it to its game object transform position instead, which works no matter what.\n"

        "body": "Problem solved. Because multiple attempts were being run on flood fill, marks were being double-counted and not cleared out. This created the false positives.\n\nFurthermore, it becomes impossible for spawning if there is no possible warp-point that is far enough based on the Manhattan Distance criteria. So that has been improved for a mercy length as well.\n\nThis should imply that, outside of some single square point, that every room is possible now.\n"
