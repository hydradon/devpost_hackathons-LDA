In general, I've always been told that, if a class exists only to serve another class (like ExportTask and the click handlers), it's good practice to make it a subclass so that the parent class is as self-contained as it can be. For some of the subclasses (the Import/ExportException classes), I went too far, so I've pulled them out into their own classes. For the others though, are you ok with keeping them as subclasses, at least until/unless we have to separate them out for testing reasons?\n\nRelated to that: now that it's getting a little bigger, do either of you have any preferences about package structure? I thought it might make sense to at least set up a \"data\" subpackage or something like that to hold the database classes and TxcPortingUtility (and related exceptions), so they'd be separated from the UI code. (I could do that separately later though, if moving the DbManager and Dictionary classes would inconvenience you with the text display changes. No reason to hurry.)\n"

We do this deliberately because some applications we might want to receive intents from know it's really a ZIP and specify that in the intent they send when the user tries to open the file.\n\nNow, I know you've said there ought to be a way to tell Android about our new filetype, and I agree it _ought_ to be possible, but I can't find a way to do it. Here's a StackOverflow link asking basically what we're trying to do:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/5744944/how-to-add-custom-mime-type\nThe non-negative scored answers are:\n- forget about mimetype, look at the host (doesn't work for us because the host is irrelevant in our case)\n- use an already-registered mimetype (doesn't work for us because Android doesn't know what a TXC is, and Android doesn't seem to have a way to register new mimetypes, at least not that I can find)\n- forget about mimetype, use the file extension (doesn't work for us because we don't always get the original filename, such as when it comes from Gmail)\n- use whatever string you want as the mimetype, so long as you set it in the sending intent (doesn't work for us because we're not sending intents, we're just receiving them from other applications)\n\nIdeally, we could just use file extension, and I'd been assuming that was possible when I originally came up with the idea for TXCs. But, we can't always do that, because some applications don't put the original filename in the intent, and we'd miss those if we filtered by file extension.\n"
