        "body": "Hi. Thanks for catching those. Your inputs look fine, and I can replicate\nboth problems.\n\nFor the modal one, the model it is returning has a non-atomic formula in\nit. So, it must be stopping too soon.\n\nFor the non-modal one, the model contains things with syntactic errors.\n\nSo, both are bugs in the program, not errors on your part. I will look into\nfixing them when I am not on a phone.\n\nThanks,\nBrian\n\nOn Fri, Aug 17, 2018, 5:33 PM frege-wittgenstein <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Saw this on Daily Nous and decided to check it out. But a few valid\n> formulas don't seem to be coming up as valid. I tested (p&(p>q))>q and\n> N(p>q)>(Np>Nq), both coming out as invalid.
