Where issues encourage discussion with other contributors and collaborators on a project, pull requests help you share your changes, receive feedback on them, and iterate on them until they\u2019re perfect!\n\n<details><summary>What is a pull request?</summary>\n\n## Pull requests\n\nLet\u2019s think back to the GitHub flow again. You have created a branch, added a file, and committed the file to your branch. Now it\u2019s time to collaborate on your file with other students taking this class. This collaboration happens in a pull request. Check out this video to learn more:\n\n:tv: [Video: Introduction to pull requests](https://youtu.be/kJr-PIfLDl4)\n<hr>\n</details>\n\nThis pull request is going to keep the changes you just made on your branch and propose applying them to the `master` branch.\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Create a pull request\n\n1. From the \"Pull requests\" tab, click **New pull request**\n1. In the \"base:\" drop-down menu, make sure the \"master\" branch is selected\n1. In the \"compare:\" drop-down menu, select \"test\"\n1. Click **Create pull request**\n1. When you\u2019ve selected your branch, enter a title for your pull request. For example `Add langyanzhou's file`\n1. The next field helps you provide a description of the changes you made. Feel free to add a description of what you\u2019ve accomplished so far. As a reminder, you have: created a branch, created a file and made a commit, and opened a pull request\n1. Click **Create pull request**\n\n<hr>\n<h3 align=\"center\">Look for my next response in your pull request</h3>\n"
