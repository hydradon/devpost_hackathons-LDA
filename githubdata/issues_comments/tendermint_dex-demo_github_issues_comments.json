Having a standalone type disambiguates these two uses at compile time, which in my view helps reduce the potential for errors. It also allows us to define `EntityID` specific utility methods, which are used by the methods in `get_set.go`.\r\n\r\nLet me know if this isn't enough of a reason to keep the standalone type and I'll remove it."
