Please\n> educate me why I'm wrong.\n\nIt's a misuse of static and will cause problems if more than one Wiegand_Reader object is instantiated.  Marking a member variable as static tells the compiler that there shall only be one copy of the variable for the entire program -- like making it a global variable. \n\n> I'm not crazy about moving the pin definitions into kegboard_config alone,\n> primarily because folks may need to take this module out and test w/ their\n> own cards & it de-modularlizes the code a bit, preferring simplicity in configuration.\n\nIO pins are a scarce resource, and sometimes features can conflict in their requirements, therefore the convention is to keep all pin definitions in one place.\n\nIf you're worried about introducing a dependency on kegboard_config.h, I suppose you could handle that locally:\n\n```\n#ifndef KB_INTERRUPT_BIT0\n#define KB_INTERRUPT_BIT0  2  // default\n#endif\n...\n```\n\nThough I wouldn't bother; kegboard_config is just c-preprocessor definitions and is included by most source files.\n\nOn another note, what's the difference between `KB_INT_WEIGAND_BIT0{0,1}` and the corresponding `KB_PIN_WEIGAND_BIT{0,1}`?  I thought this protocol only required two lines, so I'm missing why four pins are used.\n\n> As for a recommended reader, any weigand-compatible tag reader should work.\n> I'm using a HID ProxPro 5355 reader (125kHz) with 26 bit and 37 bit cards.\n\nGreat, thanks -- I'll try to find a cheap one on eBay so I can play with this..\n\nthanks,\nmike\n"

Unfortunately the pin we use (D6) does not support PCINT on the mega.\n\nHere's something you can try: These pins support PCINT on Mega:\n\n```\n10, 11, 12, 13,  50, 51, 52, 53,  62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69\n```\n\nPick one and change `KB_PIN_SERIAL_RFID_RX` in `kegboard_config.h` accordingly.  (We already use 10-13 so pick one of the others.)\n\nRecompile and reflash.  Using a jumper wire, connect pin D6 on the Kegboard shield to the pin you selected. Then give it a try.\n"

        "body": "Sorry to ping an old thread (I'm a bit late on the KegBot bandwagon), but maybe someone here can help resolve a similar issue?  Days of toiling have gone nowhere. \r\n\r\nIssue: Wiegand RFID does not work on Arduino Mega.\r\n\r\nSetup: I'm using an Arduino Mega 2560 with a Wiegand RFID reader setup per the [wiki post](https://github.com/Kegbot/kegboard/wiki/HID-Wiegand-RFID-Reader-Support).  Connecting the reader to pin A4/A5 works fine with Arduino UNO, but fails for Mega. \r\n\r\nIf I enable Wiegand `#define KB_ENABLE_WIEGAND_RFID 1` (and disable ID-12), then the default PIN settings `#define KB_PIN_WIEGAND_RFID_DATA0 A4\r\n  #define KB_PIN_WIEGAND_RFID_DATA1 A5` cause _everything_ to fail (flow meters and RFID do not work) [kegboard_config reference](https://github.com/Kegbot/kegboard/blob/39c1f45470d8e4c67829cc08c9d684751725081f/arduino/kegboard/kegboard_config.h#L111). \r\n\r\nIf I reassign the PINs for RFID to anything else (e.g. 20-21, 51,53), then flow meters work but RFID still fails.  It seems that pins 2,3,18,19,20,21 are preferred by others for Wiegand RFID [example](https://github.com/ugge75/Wiegand-Protocol-Library-for-Arduino-MEGA-2560).\r\n\r\nBased on [the chart](https://github.com/NicoHood/PinChangeInterrupt/#pinchangeinterrupt-table) (below), the Mega pinout is quite different than the Uno and I'm at a loss to figure out why things are not compatible, or whether they even _can_ be compatible.\r\n\r\nIs there some pin assignment where Wiegand RFID will work on the Mega?  I know that 6 taps are enabled by default for the Mega (pins 2,3,18,19,20,21) -- if two are disabled can those pins be dedicated to RFID?  When I attempt this (I tried this, and all the pins listed above by @mik3y), it does not work.\r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated. Thanks for making Kegbot -- it's seriously awesome.  \r\n\r\n#### Official Arduinos\r\n```\r\n| PCINT |  Uno/Nano/Mini  |   Mega/2560    | Leonardo/Micro | HL2 (8/16/32u2) |\r\n| ----- | --------------- | -------------- | -------------- | --------------- |\r\n|     0 |  8       (PB0)  | 53 SS   (PB0)  |    SS   (PB0)* |  0 SS   (PB0)*  |\r\n|     1 |  9       (PB1)  | 52 SCK  (PB1)  |    SCK  (PB1)  |  1 SCK  (PB1)   |\r\n|     2 | 10 SS    (PB2)  | 51 MOSI (PB2)  |    MOSI (PB2)  |  2 MOSI (PB2)   |\r\n|     3 | 11 MISO  (PB3)  | 50 MISO (PB3)  |    MISO (PB3)  |  3 MISO (PB3)   |\r\n|     4 | 12 MOSI  (PB4)  | 10      (PB4)  |  8/A8   (PB4)  |  4      (PB4)   |\r\n|     5 | 13 SCK   (PB5)  | 11      (PB5)  |  9/A9   (PB5)  |  5      (PB5)   |\r\n|     6 |    XTAL1 (PB6)* | 12      (PB6)  | 10/A10  (PB6)  |  6      (PB6)   |\r\n|     7 |    XTAL2 (PB7)* | 13      (PB7)  | 11      (PB7)  |  7      (PB7)   |\r\n| ----- | --------------- | -------------- | -------------- | --------------- |\r\n|     8 | A0       (PC0)  |  0 RX   (PE0)* |                |         (PC6)*  |\r\n|     9 | A1       (PC1)  | 15 RX3  (PJ0)* |                |         (PC5)*  |\r\n|    10 | A2       (PC2)  | 14 TX3  (PJ1)* |                |         (PC4)*  |\r\n|    11 | A3       (PC3)  |    NC   (PJ2)* |                |         (PC2)*  |\r\n|    12 | A4 SDA   (PC4)  |    NC   (PJ3)* |                |         (PD5)*  |\r\n|    13 | A5 SDC   (PC5)  |    NC   (PJ4)* |                |                 |\r\n|    14 |    RST   (PC6)* |    NC   (PJ5)* |                |                 |\r\n|    15 |                 |    NC   (PJ6)* |                |                 |\r\n| ----- | --------------- | -------------- | -------------- | --------------- |\r\n|    16 |  0 RX    (PD0)  | A8      (PK0)  |                |                 |\r\n|    17 |  1 TX    (PD1)  | A9      (PK1)  |                |                 |\r\n|    18 |  2 INT0  (PD2)  | A10     (PK2)  |                |                 |\r\n|    19 |  3 INT1  (PD3)  | A11     (PK3)  |                |                 |\r\n|    20 |  4       (PD4)  | A12     (PK4)  |                |                 |\r\n|    21 |  5       (PD5)  | A13     (PK5)  |                |                 |\r\n|    22 |  6       (PD6)  | A14     (PK6)  |                |                 |\r\n|    23 |  7       (PD7)  | A15     (PK7)  |                |                 |\r\n| ----- | --------------- | -------------- | -------------- | --------------- |\r\n```\r\n"

        "body": "Its been awhile since I played with wiegand and the interrupts. But if I recall correctly, the megas have 6 hardware interrupts (2,3,18,19,20,21), and the others only have 2 (2,3), the default code uses these for the flow meters. The wiegand interface is using the PcInt ability to get additional interrupts on any other pins. One important thing to note here is that the `attachInterrupt(n, fnc, mode)` function handles the mapping of `n` to a pin, this value will always be `0-5` on a mega, which translates to pins `2,3,18,19,20,21`. When using `PCattachInterrupt(pin, fnc, mode)`, `pin` is a reference to an actual pin. From what I can tell the PCInterrupt functionality was written for the Atmega168, so I wouldn't be surprised if it has bugs related to the mega. Based on your chart above you might want to try using pins `A8-A15`\r\n\r\nIf you don't plan on using all the flow meters on the mega you can certainly repurpose their regular hardware interrupts for wiegand. In that case simply make the following changes.\r\n \r\n```cpp\r\n#if defined(__AVR_ATmega1280__) || defined(__AVR_ATmega2560__)\r\n#define KB_NUM_METERS             6\r\n#define KB_PIN_METER_C            21\r\n#define KB_PIN_METER_D            20\r\n#define KB_PIN_METER_E            19\r\n#define KB_PIN_METER_F            18\r\n#else\r\n```\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nPCattachInterrupt(KB_PIN_WIEGAND_RFID_DATA0, wiegandData0, FALLING);\r\nPCattachInterrupt(KB_PIN_WIEGAND_RFID_DATA1, wiegandData1, FALLING);\r\n```\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n#if defined(__AVR_ATmega1280__) || defined(__AVR_ATmega2560__)\r\n#define KB_NUM_METERS             4\r\n#define KB_PIN_METER_C            21\r\n#define KB_PIN_METER_D            20\r\n#else\r\n```\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nattachInterrupt(4, wiegandData0, FALLING);\r\nattachInterrupt(5, wiegandData1, FALLING);\r\n```"

Let me know if I should submit a PR or just document things here for those that come later.  These changes are verified with my own setup and behave as expected for UNO and MEGA boards.\r\n\r\n\r\nKegboard_Config.h changes [original code](https://github.com/Kegbot/kegboard/blob/master/arduino/kegboard/kegboard_config.h)\r\n```cpp\r\n// Using ATMega board?\r\n#if defined(__AVR_ATmega1280__) || defined(__AVR_ATmega2560__) \r\n#define KB_BOARD_ATMEGA 1\r\n#endif\r\n...\r\n...\r\n// Atmega1280 (aka Arduino mega) section\r\n#if KB_BOARD_ATMEGA  \r\n  // Wiegand requires 2 hardware interrupt pins, meaning NUM_METERS = 4 and \r\n  // pins 18/19 are used for RFID, else NUM_METERS = 6\r\n  #ifdef KB_ENABLE_WIEGAND_RFID\r\n  #define KB_NUM_METERS             4\r\n  #define KB_PIN_METER_C            21\r\n  #define KB_PIN_METER_D            20\r\n  #else\r\n  #define KB_NUM_METERS             6\r\n  #define KB_PIN_METER_C            21\r\n  #define KB_PIN_METER_D            20\r\n  #define KB_PIN_METER_E            19\r\n  #define KB_PIN_METER_F            18\r\n  #endif // KB_ENABLE_WIEGAND_RFID == 1\r\n#else\r\n#define KB_NUM_METERS             2\r\n#endif // KB_BOARD_ATMEGA\r\n```\r\nKegboard_Config.h change [original code](https://github.com/Kegbot/kegboard/blob/master/arduino/kegboard/kegboard.ino#L493)\r\n```cpp\r\n#if KB_ENABLE_WIEGAND_RFID\r\n  #if KB_BOARD_ATMEGA   // Hardcoded interrupt pin assigment for ATMega board 4=18, 5=19)\r\n  attachInterrupt(4, wiegandData0, FALLING);\r\n  attachInterrupt(5, wiegandData1, FALLING);\r\n  #else \r\n  PCattachInterrupt(KB_PIN_WIEGAND_RFID_DATA0, wiegandData0, FALLING);\r\n  PCattachInterrupt(KB_PIN_WIEGAND_RFID_DATA1, wiegandData1, FALLING);\r\n  #endif // KB_BOARD_ATMEGA\r\n  pinMode(KB_PIN_WIEGAND_RFID_DATA0, OUTPUT);\r\n  pinMode(KB_PIN_WIEGAND_RFID_DATA1, OUTPUT);\r\n  digitalWrite(KB_PIN_WIEGAND_RFID_DATA0, HIGH);\r\n  digitalWrite(KB_PIN_WIEGAND_RFID_DATA1, HIGH);\r\n  digitalWrite(KB_PIN_WIEGAND_RFID_DATA0, LOW);\r\n  digitalWrite(KB_PIN_WIEGAND_RFID_DATA1, LOW);\r\n  pinMode(KB_PIN_WIEGAND_RFID_DATA0, INPUT);\r\n  pinMode(KB_PIN_WIEGAND_RFID_DATA1, INPUT);\r\n  digitalWrite(KB_PIN_WIEGAND_RFID_DATA0, HIGH);\r\n  digitalWrite(KB_PIN_WIEGAND_RFID_DATA1, HIGH);\r\n  gWiegand.reset();\r\n  gLastWiegandInterruptMillis = 0;\r\n#endif\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the changes above, the MEGA sacrifices two taps when running Wiegand RFID.
