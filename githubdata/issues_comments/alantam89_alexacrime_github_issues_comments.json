Still trying to get it to loop back to takedTo based on user input, but 1) it only seems to work with \"lets continue\" since \"yes\" and others trigger game start, despite being in \"questioning state\". 2) makes it through one loop back, then goes into error at end of talking to 2nd person. Haven't figured out the cause of that yet. Been trying different state stuff, but so far don't know."
