Especially for you I make an exception and added the dataset-links.txt to the repo, see e4f5ab476daf5311127a64c01720aaaddfc1f416. Since you are interested in the technology used in this repo, you might want to read this article Rik wrote about this little project: https://medium.com/towards-data-science/automatic-topic-clustering-using-doc2vec-e1cea88449c (~4min read).\r\n\r\nCare to share what you are up to?"

Thought the whole webpage thing was really cool as soon as I saw it and was just trying to study how it was done. Was just very curious, as it was a unique way to represent clusters in an interactive manner. Really awesome idea!"

Also note that since we don't have a known K, we could probably use a density based clustering method, or my preferred method of hierarchical when working with text, as it allows to visually see separation and better choose the cutoff criteria. This is really cool code!"
