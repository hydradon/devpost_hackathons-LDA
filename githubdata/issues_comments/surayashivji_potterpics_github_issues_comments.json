So because my old email address was being used as a primary contact and it wasn't confirmed, it kept loading infinitely and crashing the app. I changed primary contact to an email I verified & created a few test accounts on Facebook and everything is working fine. So just a heads up: users without Facebook confirmed emails won't be able to use the app. "
