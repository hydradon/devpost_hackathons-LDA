        "body": "Hi! Thanks for your interest!\n\nTo build the application in the messaging directory, you would need to download play-1.3.1 and install mysql locally. You can modify the application.conf to update the project settings to build it locally.\n\nTo build the application in the translator/ directory, you only need to install python3, django and the pub nub library. We\u2019re sorry that it was not better documented, we did not have too much time to set up the local dev and will be sure to clean it up soon. Also, we would like to note that we used ngrok for the purposes of the demo to avoid the need to deploy our applications to a server. Our Pubnub account is synced to our grok instance so that may have to be updated if you would like to test our web hooks.\n\nBest,\nTeam TextTranslator\n\n\nOn May 14, 2017, 12:01 PM -0400, Eric Mueller <notifications@github.com>, wrote:\n> The demo looks awesome.
