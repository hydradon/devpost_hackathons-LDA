I'm not as familiar with the smart contract itself, but you can find all the solidity code [here](https://github.com/ethereumgeek/bet/blob/master/SocialMediaBetting.sol).\r\n\r\nThe web app also doesn't support all the features built into the smart contract. The web app doesn't have any explicit support for expiring contracts as far as I know, and I'm not sure how it would respond if a contract did expire.\r\n\r\nWhat I showed in the demo above is (again, as far as I know) everything the web app is capable of (besides the bet detail view which you can navigate to by clicking a bet on the master view)."
