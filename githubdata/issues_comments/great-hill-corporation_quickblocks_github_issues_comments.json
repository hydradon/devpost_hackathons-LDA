So we get new data in, which does not have a parsed function, and we add it to 'gold' And then, the next time the test runs, we get a parsed function, which we then add, which then always passes. So it fails only on first run. Probably because ethabi is not present on the machine.\r\n\r\nWe probably don't need this any longer since we can now fully parse the ABI in code without ethaabi."
