        "body": "> If an Aragon DAO can deposit funds into the VirtueDAO, then really that just means that any address can deposit funds into a VirtueDAO right?\r\n\r\nYup, any address can deposit funds into a virtue DAO - e.g. Aragon, DAOStack, Moloch, individual accounts.\r\n\r\n>  In that case, the VirtueDAO is more like a sidecar/app that any Ethereum entity can interact with rather than something that directly integrates.\r\n\r\nYes, that's one use case. There could be a deeper integration. The sidecar (nested DAO) approach is the simplest one. \r\n\r\nSome alternate non-sidecar configurations would be:\r\n\r\n- Replace the proposal module in an Aragon DAO with a VirtuDAO\r\n- Investor/product purchase/grant $ -> VirtueDAO (no parent DAO)\r\n- rDAI interest -> VirtueDAO (no parent DAO)"
