It handles the Revit.API and RevitAPI.dll references, as well as the references to images in `SlackRibbon.cs`.  \n\nAs for the `TransactionMode.Automatic`, the only 2 occurrences of that code was where no changes were being made to the Revit document (in `SlackRibbon.cs` and `EventsApplication.cs`) and therefore it was either unnecessary or could be changed to `TransactionMode.Manual`\n\nFinally, changing the target .NET build did not cause issues with the 2015 version. I need to do further testing with the 2016 and 2017 versions before making a PR, but this should be done by the end of the week. \n"

I can't be sure, but the files in the zip file may be for Revit 2015 only, and therefore is looking for Revit 2015's API files. If Revit 2015 isn't installed, it can't find them and gives you the error you see above. \r\n\r\nWe do have the ability to build different versions of Revit (2015-2017, but 2018 shouldn't be difficult to add) that reference the proper version's API files, so I think it's a matter of adding different zip files for each version.

It mentioned 2015 specifically, but when we found it worked, we moved those files into the other version add-in folders and found it worked too. However, we had all versions installed. Then on some project teams, those teams only had their project-specific version installed, which is when we realized the error occurred. "
