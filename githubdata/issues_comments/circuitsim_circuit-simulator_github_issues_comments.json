Systems, so audio electronics (especially guitar amps/effects) is an interest of mine too.\n\nLike you say, this project is fairly young so there's lots to do. What's your background/interests programming-wise? You sound like you might enjoy working on the simulation stuff, rather than the UI? There's not much of a to-do list at the moment, but we could create a bunch of issues for stuff you might be interested in.\n\nHave you played around with [the Falstad simulator](http://falstad.com/circuit/) at all? Most of my inspiration comes from that since I did some work on it for a uni project. You can find the source [here](https://github.com/hausen/circuit-simulator).\n\nBTW I'm about to start a new job so my contributions might ramp down a bit. It would be great to have someone to work with though :smiley: \n"

Moving the `transient state` out would help make this possible.\n\nFor example:\n\n``` javascript\n{\n  views: {\n    id: {\n      typeID,\n      props: {\n        id,\n        dragPoints: [Vector], // 2 drag points\n        connectors: [Vector],\n\n        resistance|current|...\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  NAME_ME: {\n    id: {\n      currents,\n      voltages\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis still leaves the problem of adding/moving components - history stack should be updated at the _end_ of adding/moving, not during, even though the `views` state will change a lot during moving.\n"

        "body": "Thanks!\n\nYes, they should.\n\nUnfortunately the implementation is a bit more complicated than that. The circuit is modelled in terms of conductance, which is the inverse of resistance. Calculating the inverse of 0\u03a9 means a division by zero. For this reason, wires are modelled as zero-valued voltage sources, rather than 0\u03a9 resistors.\n\nI'll need to either:\n1. not allow users to set resistors to 0\u03a9\n2. allow them, but put in a special case for 0\u03a9\n\nI tend to use [this](http://www.falstad.com/circuit/]) as a reference. It seems he chose option 1. I think option 2 is better from a UX point of view though, users kind of just expect this to work.\n"
