        "body": "At the end, we really need the live version to use SSL. There's no good way around that.\n\nFor the time being, a few interesting proposals are possible:\n- The simplest one is to md5 (or, in my preference, SHA512) the password on the client side prior to sending it, and thus never sending the actual password (which would then be hashed by PHP in a more secure fashion, resulting in all the benefits of the current system with one drawback fixed.\n  - However, this fix isn't what one might think. It would simply mean that the user's password couldn't be intercepted in transit and used on other sites - For GAMR, an attacker would just send the hash directly as authentication.\n- This means that a more complicated system is needed. A rotating set of hash algorithms in use, such that the server and client always agree on which one to use, would block the trivial attack on the last method.\n  - This would work, kind of. The problem is, its complicated, and its not without its own, much smaller holes.\n- A Diffie-Hellman key exchange could be performed. This would mean that the client and server never exchange the password, they just agree on what it is.\n\nIn the end, all of these would work much better in an environment with SSL/TLS in place. I recommend that live servers use these, if not always, then for registration and login. This, however, is its own issue (#25).\n"
