        "body": "Hi Joseph, I thought upon our in person discussion the issue had been resolved. it is uncommon to use camelCase for repository names. I believe crowdsink is supposed to be a word play on the term crowdsource. Since it is a single word, we are sticking with a single word. For further clarification we can add a logo to distinguish that it is crowd sink and not crowds ink. Thanks"
