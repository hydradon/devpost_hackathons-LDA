I'm certainly open for PRs or better ways to pull images of cars and metermaids. \nAnother great improvement would be to add the images confirmed to be metermaids from s3 to the data pool. \nAs well as false-positives (cars that trigger the text message, but aren't actually metermaids.).\n\nThis project actually needs a lot of cleaning up. I need to refactor the entire project so it's easier to \n1. Understand the flow (documentation might help, but I find just having clean, organized code is always a good start).\n2. package and distribute \n3. contribute\n\nAs always, it's Github, so feel free to fork, improve, and share. This was less than a weekend project I did at a hackathon. That being said, I will refactor it so it's a little bit more respectable and versatile. (Cars v. metermaids was just a simple demo example that was easy to implement and had an immediate, 'graspable' utility, especially for those who don't code).\n"
