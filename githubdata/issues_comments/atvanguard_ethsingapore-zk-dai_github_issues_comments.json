        "body": "Hi @akolotov \r\nThe notes will also have a third-param which is a random nonce. So a note will be `Hash(owner, value, nonce)`. This implementation was only for a 36-hour hackathon, hence we skipped it - sorry about that. If you are interested you can take a look at the new [design doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z3ZRLLD-wvgERe_KO5VhqxEJDqiBd3xxfLO1pYk7Z0k/edit).\r\n\r\nFeel free to re-open the issue if you have any further questions."
