        "body": "So there are three possible ways to update internal state with the Chrome extension API, each of which have pros and cons, particularly relating to a few key edge cases.\n\nRelevant APIs\n- `history`: tracking `history.onVisited` events\n- `webNavigation`: tracking `webNavigation.onCommitted` events\n- `tabs`: listening for updates to `tab.url` in `tabs.onUpdated`\n\nEdge cases\n- Server redirects (eg auto-corrected Wikipedia links or Google search results)\n  - only `webNavigation` does this right\n- Instant tabs (where the content is loaded in a shadow tab with no 'referrer', and then replaced)\n  - `history` can't track `onTabReplaced` events\n- Custom history state manipulation (eg React Router or the Issues/PR tabs on GitHub repos)\n  - `history` misses this, but `tabs` does it naturally and `webNavigation` has an `onHistoryStateUpdated` event that catches it\n\nSince the `tabs` permission was already necessary for injecting the html for the overlay, and since the `tabs.onUpdated` was by far the cleanest to implement, I decided to prioritize simplicity by keeping it.\n\nPersonally, I'd love to ditch the html injection altogether and have the whole interface in a popup from the browser item, at which point we could move state to the `history` or `webNavigation` API to get rid of the \"read and change all websites\" warning, but until [this](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=436489) feature get added in Chrome we're stuck with html injection via `tabs`, and since we're already declaring `tabs` it seems best to also use that for tracking history, as opposed to adding another permission for that.\n\nHowever, if there is a compelling case as to why `history` (or `webNavigation`) would be better, I'd love to hear it (or review pull requests!).\n"

My ulterior goal is to archive this to make sense of my\nhistory/browsing habits later.\n\nAs for mobile browsing - I tend to avoid it because switching between\nthings is a bit hard. I can certainly see how a tree UI would help me to\nbrowse like a normal person, and therefore would help me to browse on my\nphone, but I doubt I'm a representative example and phone are not very\npractical for this mode of information binging ;-)\n\nOn 28 June 2016 at 19:09, Joel Gustafson notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Interesting.\n> I thought about this when first designing the layout, and decided that it\n> would get too cluttered too quickly.
