        "body": "Hi Cassidy, sorry for the long wait on a reply. ThinkLikeAComputer is a two-player game in the style of Family Feud. We use the Clarifai API to assign weighted tags associated to a randomly selected image that is then displayed in-game. The players then have to think about how a VR algorithm, the titular \"computer\", perceives the image (and are scored accordingly), so in a manner of speaking, the game is ultimately an exercise in a sort of empathy.\n\nHappy Holidays!\nDan and Beverly\n"
