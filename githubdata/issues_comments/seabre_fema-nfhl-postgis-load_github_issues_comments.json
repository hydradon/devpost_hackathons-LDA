Maybe a day with CPU @ 2.90GHz and 8GB of RAM on Ubuntu 14.04. I didn't have an SSD at the time, either, so that probably would have helped a lot.\n\nYeah, the download list is pretty old. I haven't updated this in a long time. \n"

It is appreciated...\n\nI had converted a full 40GB or so and had to abort the existing conversion process due to the long conversion time since the hazard file is on my local machine and the postgis server is on a network machine. Now I at least know roughly how much longer I would have had to go to get to the end (which seems to be about another 10GB or so or 20% left). I guess I can try the whole conversion again tomorrow...\n\nThanks again,\n-tph018 \n"
