Later on, I want to go crazy and make the website look really slick. Here are my current ideas:\r\n\r\n- number of commits throughout the year -- similar to the profile heatmap but a histogram\r\n- contributions to repositories throughout the year. Similar to this graph in youtube rewind:\r\n![rewindGraph](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13894625/70325560-41217600-1800-11ea-9da8-8a80c2fa7ad7.PNG)\r\n- Show new organizations you joined and people you started following in a timeline graph or something.\r\n- Use some metrics to determine your most contributed to the project in year x\r\n- Use some metric to determine the repository you contributed to that had the most community impact.
