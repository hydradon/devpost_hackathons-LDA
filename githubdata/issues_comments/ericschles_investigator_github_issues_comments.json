        "body": "Hey Ian,\n\nThat's a great question!  There is no difference between the goals.  However, I'd say traffickingGrab was an early attempt and a poor one at that.  It was early in my programming days and stands as one of the worst pieces of code I've written.  This is definitely my fault - I have a bad habit of starting a project in one form and then giving up, and starting over in a new form.  I like to take the good ideas from the previous project without any of the cruft of the old.  \n\nIn fact, this version, is probably closer to the 50th iteration of the same idea.  But that's the advantage of mostly working alone (on this), I get to learn what I can from each iteration and then move onto a new repository.  \n\nHowever, I've recognized this pattern and I think it's time to stick it out with one repo.  That's why this one has key features the others did not:\n- a commitment to documentation\n- a commitment to code clarity with careful documentation standards for every single function\n- a commitment to test driven development - that will be going on the road map soon - to get everything working on travis-ci (I'm still trying to do decide on how to test the machine learning pieces the right way)\n- a commitment to being transparent - which is why all conversations are happening in the issues of the repo\n"
