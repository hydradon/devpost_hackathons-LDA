        "body": "Putting in a timeout is a good idea; maybe after 15-30 seconds of being paused the MediaPlayer can stop, and if the user hits play after that the app should just notify them that it's loading the stream (probably through a Toast or something). This won't be hard to implement, so I'll fix this up asap.\r\n\r\nAs for the slowdown when swiping between tabs you're experiencing: I'm not seeing any lag when swiping between tabs on my own phone, and my LogCat isn't saying anything about dropped frames either (neither are those specific errors showing up on my device). Could you give me more details about the conditions under which it's lagging? i.e. is it only happening when you're on 4G and not WiFi, perhaps, or if you have more apps running in the background, etc. \r\n\r\nLooking at the memory profiler:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30734384/40074831-a3e067c0-582f-11e8-8dfe-ee220bf63d74.png)\r\n\r\nIt's maintaining a pretty steady level of usage just under 256MB (the fluctuations pop up when I scroll through the DJs or the shows. I do think that I can bring the graphics memory usage down, though: there are some drawables with just one size that are in res/drawables; these should have multiple sizes that go into specific drawable folders (the background is 900x1440 px, which is overkill for lower-dpi devices). Truthfully I'm not entirely sure if this memory usage is what's causing slowdowns for you, but this is anyway a good change to make so I'll get on this as well."

(Although you did say that there was lag when switching between tabs specifcally. The fluctuation in memory usage when swiping between tabs is just around 5 MB, at least on my device, but while I don't _think_ there's something else going on the background eating memory or causing lag, I could still be wrong).\r\n\r\nLet me know if it's smoother now! (If it's not, could you give me a little more information on your device and the conditions under which it's lagging?)"
