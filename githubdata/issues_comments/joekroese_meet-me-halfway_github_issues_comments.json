        "body": "Hi Mateusz, this project is such a mess that I've decided it will be easier to rewrite it all rather than fix it. A group of four of us made it in one night for a hackathon when we were all quite new to web development - it's not an inspiring piece of software development! I love the idea and will return to it but for now, it doesn't build correctly and I wouldn't advise you spend too much time with it.\r\n\r\nIf I were you and interested in getting something like this running, I'd look at the main resources we used: [Djando](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and the [Skyscanner API](https://partners.skyscanner.net/affiliates/travel-apis/).\r\n\r\nIf you end up writing something like this - or choose to rewrite and refactor this code - do let me know as I do plan on getting this running again.\r\n\r\n"
