I will probably start a Quora under a pseudonym just because I liked writing there.\r\n\r\nI am not sure which book I recommended, but I personally like http://greenteapress.com/thinkapjava/thinkapjava.pdf. It gave me a good understanding of OOP. It's an object-late kind of textbook, so it goes through procedural programming concepts first, that way readers understand why OOP was developed.\r\n \r\nAdd me on linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dylanob/. We can keep in touch.\r\n"
