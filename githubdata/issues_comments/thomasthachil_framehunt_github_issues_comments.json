        "body": "The application was fully working for the hackathon demo. There's a few things to consider if it's not running properly today.\r\n1. A known issue is that the express.js server has to be running on a different machine than the react front-end.\r\n2. Currently the server isn't running anywhere (We shut down the AWS machine onto which we were running the server during the hackathon). So you'd have to set it up somewhere yourself.\r\n3. The Clarifai API, which does a lot of the image recognition work for our project, needs a valid API key to function, and you'd have to procure a valid key yourself (free for a limited amount of operations) and insert it in the source code (that would be in src/utils.js, which currently has an old, expired api key).\r\n\r\nSorry about that. We've all been very busy with schoolwork and finals are coming up, so I don't expect us to be back working on this until mid-december. Then we'll probably write a setup tutorial.\r\nThanks for your interest!"
