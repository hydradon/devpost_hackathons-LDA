This is not where my accounts are located, I have the local app. \r\n\r\nFor 2, I am going to hold off on this for the time being. I'm not sure if I will continue in the app mining program and even if so, I think I'd rather it go to product hunt for now. "

Finally, App Center is valid for all blockstack apps, regardless the App Mining program."
