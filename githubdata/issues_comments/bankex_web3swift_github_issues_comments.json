        "body": "Hello there!\r\n\r\nI'm glad I can join the party. I think that what previous commenters pointed out is correct, I just stumbled upon a very similar problem:\r\n\r\nTHIS WORKS:\r\n```\r\npragma solidity ^0.4.17;\r\n\r\ncontract Count {\r\n  uint8 counter;\r\n\r\n  function getCounter() public constant returns(uint8) {\r\n    return counter;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  function increaseCounter() public {\r\n    counter += 1;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Straight forward to call in web3swift:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Most configuration code omitted to simplify\r\nlet contract = web3.contract(contractABI, at: EthereumAddress(\"...\"))\r\nlet tx = contract?.method(\"increaseCounter\", parameters: [], options: options)\r\n//\r\n// SEND Tx code Omitted\r\n```\r\n\r\nTHIS **DOES NOT** WORK:\r\n\r\n```\r\npragma solidity ^0.4.17;\r\n\r\ncontract Count {\r\n  uint8 counter;\r\n  // Code omitted ...\r\n  \r\n  function increaseCounter(uint8 _value) public { // Now function takes an argument\r\n    counter += _value;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNow, using web3swift my first instinct, (like I believe the other commenters did), was to pass the function argument in the **parameters:** param of the function:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Most configuration code omitted to simplify\r\nlet contract = web3.contract(contractABI, at: EthereumAddress(\"...\"))\r\nlet tx = contract?.method(\"increaseCounter\", parameters: [Int(1)] as [AnyObject], options: options)\r\n//\r\n// Sign/Send Tx code Omitted\r\n```\r\nThis returns the error the original commenter posted.\r\nSo, I guess there's a bit of confusion in here, (maybe I need to know web3js a bit better), but If in the meantime you could show us what's the easiest way to pass arguments to contract functions that take parameters, I'd deeply appreciate it! (from the sample you posted it's still not very clear... to me, at least...)\r\n\r\nHow would you call the method above using web3swift? it has this 'piece' of ABI:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"constant\": false,\r\n    \"inputs\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"name\": \"_value\",\r\n        \"type\": \"uint8\"\r\n      }\r\n    ],\r\n    \"name\": \"increaseCounter\",\r\n    \"outputs\": [],\r\n    \"payable\": false,\r\n    \"stateMutability\": \"nonpayable\",\r\n    \"type\": \"function\"\r\n  },\r\n```\r\n\r\nRegardless, This is fantastic work!\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
