The only other arguments that I can think of are being able to re-start when the user leaves and then comes back, but even then, we'd want to start from scratch (maybe?)...  Apparently we can just mark the layout as only vertical, and that'll prevent it from changing, so I'll add that now.  \n\nIf we close this, we should figure out a way to deal with the song input better then. For people with 100's of songs, they'll have to stay on Pacer for a long time (~10-20minutes) without navigating away. I'm planning to refactor the BPMMusicFinderActivity for [issue 5](https://github.com/jemitk/Pacer/issues/5)  anyways, so maybe it'll turn out to be really easy to keep track of what they tapped after that. \n"
