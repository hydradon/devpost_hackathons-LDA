        "body": "Hi David,\n\nI really appreciate your help and you taking the time to provide feedback\nand guidance.\nA couple of those items were on my todo list, but the CSS update and snap\ncommentary I would never have gotten on my first presentation.\nThank you very much.\nHappily merged.\n\nCheers,\nDR\n\n\nOn Tue, Jul 31, 2018 at 9:47 PM David Russell <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Hi Darren,\n>\n> I've just been looking over your presentation - very cool subject and\n> slideshow. And seriously good job for a first time GitPitch user. And\n> because you're new to GitPitch I also wanted to give you a little feedback\n> on some ways you can simplify and improve your approach to building this\n> presentation. And because GitPitch is a *git-native* presentation tool\n> the best way for me to do that is to create this PR :)\n>\n> Before you dig into the details you can open and view my version of your\n> presentation right here\n> <https://gitpitch.com/gitpitch/MIM-VoiceAssistant/presentation#/16>. This\n> is another great thing about GitPitch, all forks/branches/versions of a\n> presentation can be viewed live.\n>\n> Here is a brief summary of the changes I have made on this PR:\n>\n>    1. The PITCHME.md markdown syntax has been simplified. On numerous\n>    slides you were using a series of nested markdown shortcuts and applying\n>    those shortcuts line-by-line on paragraphs of text. This PR shows you how\n>    you can apply a single CSS style to an entire block of text, making your\n>    presentation markdown a whole lot cleaner and easier to maintain. See how\n>    the *commentary* CSS classes have been used for further details.\n>    2. As snap-layouts are used on almost every slide within this\n>    presentation I have disabled transitions globally in the PITCHME.yaml\n>    settings per the recommendation\n>    <https://gitpitch.com/docs/layout-features/snap-layout-slide-transitions/>\n>    in the GitPitch docs. I think this also improves the viewer experience when\n>    you are showing the series of slides displaying the architecture diagram.\n>    Less distracting activity when transitioning between these slides.\n>    3. I used a small bit of CSS to create a little more space between the\n>    bullet points on your slides which makes them a little nicer. This is a\n>    small subtle change, not required by any means.\n>    4. The logo size has been slightly adjusted to make it a little more\n>    legible for old eyes (like mine).\n>    5. All image assets have been size optimized using tinypng.com for\n>    viewing and sharing on the web per the recommendation\n>    <https://gitpitch.com/docs/image-features/background/> in the GitPitch\n>    docs. This step shaved over 4Mb off the image files used for this\n>    presentation, that's a 66% saving and it translates into improved loading\n>    and viewing times for your audience.\n>\n> That's it. I hope you find some of this feedback useful. Completely up to\n> you whether you want to accept and merge the PR itself. I just think it's a\n> great way to share knowledge.
