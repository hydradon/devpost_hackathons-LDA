Right now I'm still busy fixing some bugs, adding tests etc.  I hope to be able to start work on RETS integration in the next couple of weeks or so.  At that point I will give tourets a spin and see if it works out for me.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I see right now that might be an issue is that its built on the placester RETS gem which is not being maintained anymore.  If its fairly easy to swap that out for the estately rets gem ([https://github.com/estately/rets](https://github.com/estately/rets)) then I'll try to do that.\r\n\r\nYes, please make me a maintainer and I'll try to contribute.\r\n\r\nOne more thing - did you happen to find some RETS servers against which I could try things out with test credentials?"

It works by having different folders located here for each theme:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/etewiah/property_web_builder/tree/master/app/themes\r\n\r\nIn the application_controller I have a set_theme_path method that reads the \u201ctheme_name\u201d value for the current agency.\r\nIt then uses prepend_view_path to add the theme path to the list of locations that rails will check for a template.  The best explanation of how prepend_view_path works can be found here:  \r\n\r\nhttp://climber2002.github.io/blog/2015/04/06/digging-rails-how-rails-finds-your-templates-part-4/\r\n\r\nThe set_theme_path method also sets the self.class.layout value.\r\n\r\nUntil I implement an admin page section for changing themes, the easiest way to experiment with the themes feature is to run the following from the rails console:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nagency = Pwb::Agency.unique_instance\r\nagency.theme_name = \"berlin\"\r\nagency.save!\r\n```"

I can obtain the translations for devise.de.yml and rails.de.yml so don't worry about those - I will add them in the next few hours.\r\n\r\nIt will be really great to have the remaining translations done.  Are you familiar with pull requests?\r\n\r\nThere are also some seed files that I use to populate the website with example data.  It would be good to translate those too but first I need to figure out a better way of organising them.\r\n\r\nIf anything is not clear or you have any questions, just let me know.  If you wish, we could arrange a skype call to discuss any issues.\r\n\r\nThanks again for offering to help."
