        "body": "1. The way I'm displaying the badge on the page is by putting the user's\n   badge in for the ones they have made progress on. So data is necessary. The\n   design could be changed to get around this.\n2. That may be leftover and not necessary anymore. The main thing I was\n   trying to avoid was accidentally getting rid of a property by using set.\n   That specific example was for testing though.\n3. Badge achieved and badge name are what I use to first trigger the alert\n   when it's been achieved then use its name to let the alert have which badge\n   was obtained. We could give the rest of the information, but I didn't see a\n   need.\n4. You're right, we could go with just date obtained, but I'm using a\n   booleanClass binding to set the styles so having a boolean there is nice\n   (although could it work with truthy/falsey if dateObtained exists or not).\n   The date is just random information I thought would be nice.\n5. I changed the string up so it would be easier to display, but we could\n   do that on the website too and not in prometheus.\n\nHope that answers your questions.\n\nOn Wed, Aug 3, 2016, 9:38 PM Vinesh Kannan notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Nice work!
