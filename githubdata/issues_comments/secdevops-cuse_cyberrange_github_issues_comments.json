Thanks again!"

        "body": "@mstair - Thanks for identifying this.  I was unaware of the potential issue with vCPU limits yet I am aware of the instance-type quota increase.  \r\n\r\nHere is the service-quota link... https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-increase.html#first-concept-chapter\r\n\r\nI performed vCPU research.  From what I understand, according to [Amazon's on-demand instance limit guidance](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/#EC2_On-Demand_Instance_limits) - there is a [calculator](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-east-1#LimitsCalculator:) that will estimate/calculate the vcpu's needed.  \r\n\r\nI currently have a limit of 4,704 vcpu's yet plugging in 30 t2.medium instances suggests I need to increase this by at least 60.  I do not run the range 24x7x365 - perhaps this is why I have not experienced this issue.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5652156/73124345-60b75e00-3f68-11ea-947f-c321ce2df3f2.png)\r\n\r\nLooking forward - I'm aiming for 50 assets to be running within the range, this suggests a possible limit of 4,804 vCPUs.  \r\n\r\nAdding a documentation label to this so I get it into the wiki / markup docs.  Thanks!\r\n\r\n"
