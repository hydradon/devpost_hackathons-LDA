Isn't it better to share it on GitHub for people to discuss and fork it? \r\n\r\nUsing selenium is great, and it provides a lot of intuitive experience for controlling the DOMs, but it comes with an annoying issue that makes me switch to puppeteer - it relies a lot on the driver. When there're some upgrades from Firefox/Chrome, the selenium engine may not work because it needs to upgrade too; while puppeteer will not have this problem. "
