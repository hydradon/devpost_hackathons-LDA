You will still receive a PR once a newer version is released, so if you wish to permanently ignore this dependency, please add it to the `ignoreDeps` array of your renovate config.\n\nIf this PR was closed by mistake or you changed your mind, you can simply rename this PR and you will soon get a fresh replacement PR opened."
