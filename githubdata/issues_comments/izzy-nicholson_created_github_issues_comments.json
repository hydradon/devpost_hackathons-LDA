        "body": "Hi, thanks for the interest.\r\nThis was a while ago and I don't have any of the hardware anymore, but from what I remember we ran it with 3 microbit microcontrollers. Load one of each of the following on separate microbits:\r\n`SatelliteLeftShoulder.py`\r\n`SatelliteRightShoulder.py`\r\n`Receiver.py`\r\n\r\nThe two microbits running the `Satellite...py` are attached to each shoulder of the user. The receiver is connected to the computer where you run the main program. \r\n\r\nThen run `post2.py` to start.\r\nIf you want to plot the measurements you collected during monitoring, you can run `plotty2.py`\r\n\r\n`port` refers to the port the microbit running `Receiver.py` is connected on. The error you're getting suggests you're missing/haven't connected the hardware."
