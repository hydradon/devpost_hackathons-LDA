        "body": "Hi Romuald,\n\nThank you for helping with the OS X build. The start does not look encouraging, for sure, but on the other hand I encountered the same problems when building it for the first time on linux, and it proved to be much easier to solve them them I thought. Most of these errors are identical (missing some additional template or typename keywords, etc) which is easy to eat through them. Seems like CLANG is even more strict than GCC, which is already much more strict than MSVC (if you ask me, it is way to much strictness, but this seems to be only my opinion). The problem is that I do not have a OS X machine. I have two options, either I try to install clang on ubuntu and try to fix some of the problems like this, or better try to install OS X in a virtual machine (which I do not know even if is possible). I will look into this!\n\nThanks,\nDan\n"

        "body": "Hi Dan, \n\nyes, clang is more strict than the other compilers (but on the other hand OS X does not handle case sensitive system, so strictness on OS X is relative ... ). \n\nUsing clang on other system could solve some of the issues but not all I think. There are errors with the use of some unavailable features (due to POSIX requirement for pthread for ex) that can not be seen without a full OS X system. \n\nI don't know how can I help you because I don't know if all the above features are needed or not (generally pthread priority is unneeded), moreover my solution is to use standard language capability (std::thread or at least OpenMP that is transparent if unable on underlaying system) instead of system library. \n\nI tried to compile a gcc on OS X  and test openMVS compilation but without success. I can go further but it still fails and that's why I say installing a compiler on other system may help but not solve all the issues.\n\nYours,\nRomuald.\n"

Believe it or not the SEACAVE library was started loooong time before std had any thread capabilities, so I was forced to implement them myself on both windows and linux.

This assumes all the include files have been dumped into some directory by running `make install` (I generally prefer not to do this with code that is changing frequently, but seems required in this case)\n\n`make install` does not work on OSX, but you can do `cmake -P cmake_install.cmake` instead.\n\nNow the following CMake command works for me:\n\n```\nVCG_ROOT=/Users/meekohi/vcglib/ EIGEN_ROOT=/usr/local/Cellar/eigen/3.2.4/include/eigen3/ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -DOpenMVG_DIR=/Users/meekohi/openmvg_build/openMVG_install/share/openMVG/cmake/ -G \"Xcode\" . ../openMVS/\n```\n\nNext I run `xcodebuild -configuration Release` but there are several compiler errors. These I can look into in more detail and see if I can produce some patches. (gist is at https://gist.github.com/Meekohi/2c74b17edee14f4e0ee5 if anyone wants to look)\n"
