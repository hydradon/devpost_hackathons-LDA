And if this is used to manage payment, probably need something like \"last-salary-paid-date\" or \"next-salary-due-date\"\r\n\r\n2) Evaluators - are you planning to have UI to set an evaluator for the task when the task is created? I may have missed it, but can the evaluator and the manager (task creator) be the same person (I don't think it can).\r\n\r\n3) Skill should be Skills and Domain should be Domains as both can be multiple\r\n\r\n4) What about \"acceptance criteria\" - or is that covered by deliverable already - ie. if brief is \"pick up all the trash by the school hall\", deliverable is \"a trash free area\", criteria is \"a photo of the trash free area, and a photo of the trash in the dump\" - or is it simply that deliverable is \"a trash free area, proved by photo of the trash free area and a photo of the trash in the dump\" - not sure if its easier and clearer to split out or not.\r\n\r\n5) For a \"sponsored\" task funded by some external donor - would we want to keep the tag/id of the sponsor, so we can collate all tasks by donor for reporting, etc. - I'm imagining that donor and task manager might be different - donor might be funding several tasks across domains, and task manager might just create tasks in a limited set of domains.\r\n"

        "body": "I'm still thinking about this, but as creators of the colony, we would set the TokenSupplyCeiling. Based on what I'm reading, we would have pots[1]  be our working capital and infuse it with our tokens. 1% of the tokens would go to pots[0], the rewards pots.  On creation of the colony, we would create the first domains and sub divisions into tasks and decide how to allocate tokens to those pots from pots[1] with our funding proposals.  As more users join the platform and earn tokens/reputation, they have say in the funding queue through funding proposals.  \r\n\r\nI would still like clarity on what we defined as a \"colony\"; is it our decentralized community jobs board? Also, how would the colony itself generate revenue? Or is it non-profit?"

        "body": "Good point @iainbarclay! A not-for-profit aligns with our brand of social good when the capital is reinvested in the community. @farahbrunache I was thinking:\r\n\r\n* The colony could make revenue by selling goods to help complete jobs (ie. Shovels to collect trash). We could initially create some supplies for certain tasks, then have others be able to sell supplies for earning more tokens, which would further help with distribution. \r\n* Yes, the 1% fee is the rewards that goes proportionally to members holding tokens and reputation\r\n* The other 99% goes to working capital to fund jobs where they become part of general fund allocation of regulation and priority funding proposals. \r\n* As for the different tokens (Ether and Travay token), the white paper states that when a colony earns revenue via its own token, the token is directly transferred to working capital, while Ether is split 90% working capital and 10% rewards (Percentages can vary depending on colony-wide vote). I wonder if we can use the Travay token as payment tokens to confer reputation. "
