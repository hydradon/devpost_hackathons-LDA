        "body": "Hello @Sajjon \r\n\r\nI'll start wit the last question: Scrypt for CryptoSwift is unfortunately delayed, I couldn't make it fast enough and fight copy of write.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the library was to\r\n- Use for signatures as a replacement to secp256k1 and other C libs\r\n- Use for fancy stuff like confidential transaction, [lib](https://github.com/shamatar/BulletproofSwift)\r\n- Implement pairings and BLS signatures (for future Ethereum releases)\r\n- Implement zkSNARK verification and proving for small circuits\r\n\r\nThere was no intention to make it abstract and based on some general underlying math package like \"Sage\", but more like pure EC arithmetics packages in other languages.\r\n\r\nRegarding the curve forms - I'd focus on a twisted edwards first. Montgommery form is more interesting only for ECDH.\r\n\r\nSincerely, Alex"
