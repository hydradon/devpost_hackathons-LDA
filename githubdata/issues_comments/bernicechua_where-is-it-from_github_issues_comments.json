        "body": "Hey Guys,\nGreat work! Much appreciated for all the hard works! Especially Bernice, great readme.\nJust a thought, I remember when we started this project we wanted to check the products origins to see if there are any possibilities its was involved in human trafficking. That's why we called it \"Where is it from\". However, due to lack of data and some technical challenges, we changed our logic from checking its origins to checking its brand logo to see if the scanned product's brand is ethic. Would that be nice to change our app name to something like \"ethic checker\" or sematically similar name? Anyhow, our objective will still remain the same. As we want users not only be able to acknowledge the problem of human trafficking but also to spread good will by using social media .\nThe reason I am suggesting a name change is because I want people to be able to catch what we were trying to accomplish with our app. Hence less words needed to explain what the app does since the app's name is pretty much self-explanatory.\nBaron\nDate: Thu, 5 May 2016 15:55:03 -0700\nFrom: notifications@github.com\nTo: where-is-it-from@noreply.github.com\nCC: baronkwan@outlook.com; mention@noreply.github.com\nSubject: Re: [BerniceChua/where-is-it-from] Bchua delete .env file from GitHub, & make img upload responsive (#17)\n\nHi Ben & Gary,\n\nTYVM for merging the pull request.
