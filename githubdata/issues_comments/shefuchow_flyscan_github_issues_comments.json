To be honest, I am a new programmer, and I just wanted to try\nout ios development for the hackathon at my school, so I thought of that\nidea and tried to run with it. Now that I only have finals to worry about,\nI am going to try and complete the project. This will be a really good\nresource.\n\nI didn't know that other github users could reach out to you like this, I'm\nactually super happy you did! Happy coding!\n\n\n\nHappy Holidays,\n\n*Mohammed S Chowdhury*\nSkanska USA Building Inc. Intern\nUniversity at Buffalo | Computer Science\n347-725-2045 | mohammed.chowdhury@skanska.com\n"
