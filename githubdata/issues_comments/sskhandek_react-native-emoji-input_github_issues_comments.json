I'd definitely like to have the performance of this keyboard be a lot better. \r\n\r\n@rijn do you recall a reason we set the renderAheadOffset to `1500` and not a lower number? Were we potentially concerned about a user trying to scroll very fast through the keyboard?"

It is just an advice, cause it is a component, I think it is a better idea to let developers decides for themselves which side of performance they would like to optimize."
