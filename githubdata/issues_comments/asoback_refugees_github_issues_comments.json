(Most go to other countries)\r\nWho are the terror groups (Not a misconception but i dont even know outside of ISIS and boko haram)\r\nThey dont face security checks. (They are vetted more than any other group entering US. This is the hardest way to get in)\r\nDrain on society (They are children)\r\nThey are just trying to get money (Most flee to low income countries)\r\nThey pay smugglers, give money to cartels (They are too broke for that, they leave all their belongings)"
