        "body": "Hi Vardhaman,\nGreat sample and good to get that shared. We would though have few asks for this based on updated contribution guidelines, which are unfortunately still in dev branch, so it's understandable that you did not see them. Here's the link for the file - https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-fx-webparts/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md. This was not there in master branch, when you submitted your PR.\n\nIn short:\n1. Folder name of the sample solution should contain the used JS library, like existing ones - like angular- or react-. If sample is not using any specific library, it should start with js- prefix\n2. Submission should be targeted to dev branch - this is for engineering to do final checkup on things, before getting merged with master - this will happen gradually at least once a week\n\nHopefully fine with these. We are trying to ensure that we have structure cross the samples and to avoid future confusion cross samples from day one... or from day two, now that the guidance was not there when you submitted yours.\n"

        "body": "thx Roland, we would have one ask around this, which is the folder naming for the sample solution. We just updated our contribution guidance with details on this, so sorry for the additional ask, since that was missing when you submitted your sample - https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-fx-webparts/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md. \n\nKey point to notice would be the folder naming. So we should use angular-, react- etc. in the name, so that sample is getting grouped with similar technologies in the folder. If you are not using any generic library, we would ask that folder name starts with js- prefix. So in this case folder name would be \"js-powerbi-embedded\".\n\nThis is really nice sample showing the integration and great to get it included. Hopefully folder rename works for you, but obviously can do that afterwards as well, if you are running out of time. \n"
