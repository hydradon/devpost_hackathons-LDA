We have run this project on MacOS machines without any issues; I suspect it will work fine on your Linux machine too, given you have no issues with the dependencies.\r\n\r\nHowever, you will have to change some directory addresses in preprocess.py, send_packets.py, and test.py. You also will have to change the IP and MAC addresses in send_packets.py.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nKaran"
