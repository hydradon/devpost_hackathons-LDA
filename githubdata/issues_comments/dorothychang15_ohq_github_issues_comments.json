        "body": "It appears that inputting the password only serves to clear the overlay, which one could still do from the Javascript Console and access all of the features available on the page. Therefore, we also need to restrict the Firebase database calls based on the authentication. That's difficult to do when everything is on the same page. I recommend moving the sign in process to a separate page, using either the official pennkey login, or [Firebase Auth](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/) so that we may use token-based authentication. That way, we can restrict access to the TA page and all of it's functionality."

        "body": "@arjun19403 You are correct. I noted this issue in the Slack channel. I have mainly addressed the issue in my latest commit. Now the actual TA page is not loaded into the DOM until the correct password is submitted. That being said, I am sure that a truly determined attacker could probably still do some damage though the JS console by sending requests directly to Firebase. In the meantime, however, I think that this does a decent enough job at securing the page. (Note that the correct styles for the form depend on the changes in #6, which I will hopefully fix in the next day or two.)\r\n\r\nRegarding Firebase Auth, I am not so familiar with it. I just skimmed the docs and I'm not sure if that is quite what we want (please correct me if I am wrong). It seems to provide a way for easy account creation and sign-in using linked accounts (e.g. Facebook, Google, etc.), but we do not want to allow account creation for the TA portal (then students can just create an account to gain access). We either need a master password (as we have now) or some way to manually manage the accounts through Firebase for this solution to work."
