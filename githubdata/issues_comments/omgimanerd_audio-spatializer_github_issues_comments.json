        "body": "Ah that explains it. The code that extracts the video ID in [line 108 of index.js](https://github.com/omgimanerd/audio-spatializer/blob/master/client/index.js#L108) naively separates the link by the`=` sign and takes the first element. If you paste in a link of that form, it won't be able to extract the video ID properly. You need to paste a link of the form:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7K4vGYL9zI\r\n(notice that this doesn't include the `list` parameter).\r\n\r\nThe `master` branch contains my full project with the spatialization code. You need to paste the **full video URL** in there according to the spec above.\r\n\r\nThe `blog-min-example` and `blog-min-example-2` branches contain minimal working examples that require you to paste **only the video ID**. You can modify them to take a URL instead if you write a more robust parser to extract the video ID.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any more questions. If you came here from my blog post, you're probably looking for the `blog-min-example` branches. You can mess with the `master` branch if you're experienced with audio processing and/or JavaScript, but it is much more complicated than the minimal working examples."
