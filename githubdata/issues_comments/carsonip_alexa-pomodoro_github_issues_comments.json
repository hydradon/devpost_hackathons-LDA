Also please check `lambda/custom/language-strings.json` for the strings to be translated.\r\n\r\nThis is not tested yet, i.e. I have yet to upload and try this version with extracted strings, therefore it is not guaranteed to work at the moment. But let's finish the translation work first. Technical issues can be resolved quickly anyway.\r\n\r\nIf you are free, feel free to review my latest commit on the translation branch to make sure there are no careless mistakes. Thanks!"
