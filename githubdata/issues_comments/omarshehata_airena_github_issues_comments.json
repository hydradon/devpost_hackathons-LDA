        "body": "RTS is definitely a thought-provoking category of games that would allow some creative stuff to be done.  The biggest thing there that comes to mind is actually resource collection.  As an example, here's some [great discussion](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/legacy-of-the-void/482775-a-treatise-on-the-economy-of-scii) about the economic implications of the \"worker pair\" AI in Starcraft II.  That discussion focuses on changing resources around a fixed system of AI, but I wonder if flipping the script there would be interesting.  \n\nMaybe more generally, writing decision-making AI might be interesting.  The example I'm thinking of is how dwarves in [Dwarf Fortress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_Fortress) decide which tasks to do, as well as other simulaiton games like The Sims.\n\nA weird one-off thought that occurred to me would be a game about controlling the flow of traffic on a city grid.  Lights need to go on and off in a manner that helps get the most traffic through without pileups.  The optimization methods necessary to tackle that challenge really well might be a little too sophisticated for the kind of thing you're aiming for, here.\n"
