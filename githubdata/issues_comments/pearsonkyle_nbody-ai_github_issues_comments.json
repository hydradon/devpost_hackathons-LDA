        "body": "You can easily use this library to set up an N-body simulation with those objects. The N-body code is based on [REBOUND](https://rebound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) so it's very precise, as long as you have a small enough time step. \r\n\r\nIt might be possible to apply machine learning to your problem but it depends on what you're trying to figure out. If you want a precise location, your best bet might be to just integrate an N-body simulation. If you need to optimize some parameters, perhaps that can be expedited with machine learning. "
