        "body": "You're right, thanks very much for letting me know. BTW, late last year I started working on version 2 of the third man app, which uses tstats/pivot instead of the datamodel command (to be honest, when I wrote version 1 I didn't realise the datamodel command doesn't use acceleration). Version 2 is in the branch 'v2'. I haven't released version 2 yet because so far this year I've been focusing on developing the Linux Auditd app.\n\nTonight (my time ~ in about 11hrs) there's a few changes I'll make to the 'v2' branch:\n1. Fix the bug you're found\n2. I found out the other day that the dnsLookup command we had to manually put into transforms (back in Splunk version 4) is no longer required since Splunk 6, so I need to update that in the searches to use the built-in lookup\n3. Move the correlation search into its own 'SA-ThirdMan' app. One of the ES developers from Splunk told me that to make the correlation search \"appear\" in the ES app, rather than adding the thirdman into the ES app's metadata import command, I should rename my app to start with 'SA-' and then it just works.\n4. The README needs updating to reflect version 2 changes better (not sure if I'll have time to get to this)\n\nLater on I'd also like to change the correlation search to use ES' provided ASN lookup and update the provided ASN lookup. Once that's sorted I'll probably release version 2. :)\n"

(I was wrong!)\n\nAs you've noticed, the search will still work but the sensitivity in reduced. If you put this: | eval date_hour=strftime(_time,\"%H\") immediately before the period eval it should fix it.\n\nI'll patch it tonight and publish v2.0.1 - For the sake of the administrators having to patch it, I hope this is the last bug!\n\nI owe you more than one coffee/beer/etc. Perhaps at conf this year? :)\n\nCheers,\nDoug\n"
