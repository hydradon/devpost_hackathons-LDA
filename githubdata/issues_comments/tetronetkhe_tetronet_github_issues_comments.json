It controls game display, everyXFrames stuff, OS events, and the pygame window.\r\n* I forgot to actually finish some of the new scoring functions in `game.py`, so you can safely ignore them.\r\n* All backups are now saved to a backup folder, to reduce clutter.\r\n* `game.py` got a fancy upgrade, and now it looks nice and has a Next display."
