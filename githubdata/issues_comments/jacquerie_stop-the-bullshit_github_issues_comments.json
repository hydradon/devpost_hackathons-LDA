I should probably write a manifesto to detail the vision I have for this extension, but I can tell you this: I'm not interested in blocking satire websites (e.g. The Onion), even if people occasionally take them seriously. The only thing I want to block are the websites generated by scripts, filled with ads and designed to provoke outrage with the ultimate objective of making their author richer. I don't want to care about political factions, I just want to punish the spammers.\n"

I just want to punish spammers.\r\n\r\n> It would be nice to fork this project to reject mainstream propaganda and publish it in r/The_Donald and /pol/. I bet someone already did fork this for the benefit of conservatives.\r\n\r\nOf course they can, but they must share back their improvements, as per the GPL.\r\n\r\nTo answer @majestrate, no, I'm not going to implement that.
