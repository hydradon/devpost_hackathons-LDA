        "body": "The problem is that you have added the file holduino.ino to your sketch named sketch_jan18. The `setup` function is defined in both sketch_jan18.ino and holduino.ino, thus the error.\r\n\r\nWhat you need to do is open the holduino sketch, rather than adding it to another sketch:\r\n\r\n1. Download holduino: https://github.com/hoanghonn/holduino/archive/master.zip\r\n2. Unzip the downloaded file. You can move the unzipped folder to any convenient location.\r\n3. (In the Arduino IDE) File > Open\r\n4. From the unzipped folder, select holduino-master/MyoConnect/holduino-src/holduino/holduino.ino\r\n5. Click \"Open\".\r\n\r\nIf you have not done so already, you will also need to install the MyoController library, as described in the readme:\r\nhttps://github.com/hoanghonn/holduino/blob/master/README.md"
