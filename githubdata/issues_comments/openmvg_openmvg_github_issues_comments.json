        "body": "thanks Pierre,\n\nI made a deeper look into openMVG source code tonight and now I found my previous question was obviously stupid. In fact Apero, can initialize intrinsic parameters with EXIF data as Bundler and... openMVG. But my error lead me to another question. From the test i've made until now, i'm very impressed by speed and accuracy of openMVG and it's also a clean, maintained and organized code. To unveil my plan, as an ArcheOS ;) maintainer,  I'm studying opportunity to replace the  good ol' Bundler by openMVG in the PPT pipeline. But Archaeological photogrammetry surveys can make extensive use of wide-angle lenses or super-wide zoom (I'm not talking about fisheyes, I know that's a different kettle of fish). These optics can produce strong distortion... so what about estimation of additional intrinsic parameters in openMVG in the future  (ok, sorry if it look like a Santa Claus letter !) ? Or do you recommend to use a software with camera and lens profile to perform distortion correction before ? Or did I miss something again...?\n\nI know it's off-topic and, as Andrew, I'm sorry to report that as an \"issue\", it's only by pure curiosity... what's you're feeling about replacing Bundler with openMVG in the PPT ?\n\nRegards,\nRomain.\n"

I plan to extend the chain when I will have more time.\n\n-> I prefer that the distortion is corrected before. I have to investigate the quality of the OpenCV calibration engine in order to see if we can do a solution by ourself to propose a calibration of the camera and the lens in order to distort the picture and run the SfM chain safely. (We can also look to see the existing openSource solution that exists)\n\nMy feeling about replacing Bundler by openMVG ?\nI'm for this kind of change, it could be an excellent opportunity for some student to add functionality.\nBut yet it's not feasible, the two point cited before have to be managed.\n\nRegards,\nPierre\n"

Maybe If I have time and necessary skills on my side I can try to do something on the two \"problematics\" points. But I'm afraid that I couldn't build something strong on this topic, given that I came from Humanities :). For now, if you are interested by an \"exportToMicMac\" function I think I could handle that...\n\nwith all my support regarding your work,\nRegards,\nRomain\n"

        "body": "Hi Dan,\nThanks for your interest about openMVG and the AC-RANSAC\n\nHave you used the openMVG implementation or re-write you own ?\n- The results do not depends of the number of corresponding points. You can see here that 1 point among 6 is detected as outlier https://github.com/openMVG/openMVG/blob/develop/src/openMVG/robust_estimation/robust_estimator_ACRansac_test.cpp.  Using a max threshold could be necessary to avoid some spurious case. Some additional sample shows that it works well for essential matrix the https://github.com/openMVG/openMVG/blob/develop/src/openMVG_Samples/robust_essential/robust_essential.cpp. Perhaps your data do not have clear outliers. You must notice that the error model is not the same for point to line model (essential or fundamental) or point to point (resection) (check the SFMIncremetal implementation). As the method is adaptive, it works better with rectified images.\n- Second point about the speed. There is no extra 10% iteration. Once a meaningful model is found, the number of iteration for optimization is reduced to 10% of the number of original iteration count. AC-RANSAC could be slower than RANSAC due to the probabillity computation but often the iteration reduction make it as fast as RANSAC. There is a price to cost to support a clean statistic noise adaptivity.\n\nPlease consider this mail address to continue the discussion:\nopenMVG-team@googlegroups.com\n\nThanks,\nPierre\n"

        "body": "Thanks, Pierre, for the quick reply. In order to implement it, I copied almost untouched the core (ACRANSAC and bestNFA routines) and for the rest my own code. For computing the error in the case of the essential matrix I use squared Sampson error (as in HZ eq 11.9). For resection I use squared reprojection error. All points are pseudo-normalized in the case of E (centered and divided by the width of the image) so K is composed only of focal-length/width. Is this a problem? Otherwise, for the same cases, my old MSAC estimator correctly finds all the inliers (permited by the threshold).\n\nAs for the speed, I was indeed speaking about those 10% iterations at the end, which are invariable performed. For instance if max iterations is 1000 and the best solution is found from the first iteration, ACRANSAC always runs 1+100 ietrations. MSAC drops the number of iterations even to 10 or lower.\n"
