But that definitely\nwould not be in iteration_1, because we will say that our customers(in a\nspecific organization) need to give all permissions to their users to help\nthis app work for them.\n\nCorporate policies do not never allow adding a new office365 user because\nthe user needs to use an app like yofit. If that is your main goal, I am\nafraid that this effort will be in vain as it will never be used in real\nlife.\n\nWhen user installs chrome extension we just map his existing office365 user\nID to  chrome extension ID. We do not and should not create a new user in\nactive directory.

I will create a separate task for approach-2.\n\nGoal of this task is to get callback notifications whenever the skype for business presence status changes for all users in the organization.\n\nThis is truly innovative way of using skype for Business APIs to track user's activity level in a day. \n\nPlease note that this is a challenging task and needs patience to be able to understand everything necessary, and work according to plan. Once it works, this is the only way in the whole world where Skype for Business is used for healthy life style.\n\nThis can be achieved in two ways. \nApproach-1: using Node-js code, rest like web apis and Skype for business installation, configuration (difficult part) on server. \nApproach-2: using (Microsoft specific technology) C# and using Lync client SDK. I can find more information for UCMA (unified communications managed api) if anyone is interested to take this approach\n\n---\n\nstep-1: Check the interactive demo at https://ucwa.skype.com/\nstep-2: get the samples under https://ucwa.skype.com/code working.
