Seems they're working on a Windows version.\r\n\r\n> Also I'm trying to deploy the model on an android based application and the video Siraj posted on his channel doesn't actually covers it neither his repository\r\n\r\nI don't have many experience of developing apps but as far as I can tell, retrieval based model is not very suitable to put the whole model to mobile device because the embedding vector size is huge. I would suggest you to serve the model on a server.\r\n\r\nBTW, if you guys have experience developing apps, maybe you can work with us! If you're interested please contact me via email: junpang.yip@gmail.com and let us get to know you and your skillset. "

        "body": "@JayYip there's the problem right, for the model to be used as a server I do need it to be run on my machine as for as far as I know, colab doesn't allow webhooks or post requests from other consoles/webservices such as dialogflow. TBH integrating it with Dialogflow as a chatbot would really be a great deal. I'm really trying on howto send my inputted query string to your model online as an server and get the ouput as result. Any ideas about how can I use this functionality? It needn't be necessary to be used as a dialogflow integration/ backend. I just need some guidance about using the model as a server and sending request and retrieving the output back, since as of now colab doesn't serve that type of services/purposes. Thanks!"
