It's made to be very sensitive as to highlight features during live presentations.\r\nA crash event should trigger the red button on the main UI to turn green and a push notification should ask you whether you're ok.\r\nThe project isn't currently being maintained. If you'd like to improve it or send patches, feel free to fork it and push some patches!"

        "body": "1) yes the acceleration includes gravity! It is taking the magnitude in XYZ and comparing it with the previous value so the gravity is always accounted for as a constant. If it goes below the threshold (which you can tune), it triggers the alarm. We are assuming the user is driving and a crash is detected when there is sudden deceleration. \r\n\r\n2) the values are being pulled by \"onSensorChange\" which gets callback every time the sensor gets a new value. I believe this depends on the sensor on your phone. From what I've seen, it looks like 100Hz on my phone (Samsung S7 Edge).\r\n\r\nHope this helps!"
