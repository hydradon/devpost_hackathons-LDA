I could see doing an exception here leading to doing exceptions elsewhere.  The hope would be to change partially or fully to React stateless components which they stated in 0.14 release notes that there would be further performance optimizations related to them.\n\nNote that ImmutableComponent doesn't even consider state for detecting changes right now.\nhttps://github.com/brave/browser-electron/blob/master/js/components/immutableComponent.js\n\nI don't think it would be that hard to do the state changes in the store, it would just require a single action which can manage each of those 3 states.\n\nI won't try to stop you from landing, but I'd like to give stateless components a shot.\n"
