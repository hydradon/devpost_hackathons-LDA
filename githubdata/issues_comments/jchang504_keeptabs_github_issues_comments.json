Also, what's the use case for this? If you're going to use a hotkey, shouldn't you just use it directly from whatever page you were on rather than first creating a new tab then using the hotkey?

I am not sure if this what caused the keys to stop working. However, the way that the keys stopped working is clear from the logs. As I was pressing keys, I realized that the hotkey that was being sent over was not being emptied out after it was sent. Rather, **whether or not I was pressing the escape key**, every keypress appended to the hotkey that was to be sent out and it just kept getting longer and longer (even though it's supposed to empty out after it's been sent). I assume this means that the extension believes that the escape key is being perpetually held down and, while it sends out the hotkey when the escape key is released (which means it does detect the key release), it does not then replace the hotkey with an empty string."

But more general domain matching is useful too, e.g. when you do want to navigate to whichever Facebook page you happen to have open. I think we should redesign the hotkey configuration a little to add a field for what should be counted as a match for a given hotkey (note this is only when deduplicate is checked). So the entry in options would look something like:\r\n\r\nHotkey | Target URL | Deduplicate? [Matches]\r\n\r\nWhere the Matches input would only appear when Deduplicate is checked."

In this latter case, the background script isn't involved at all -- the tab search page is brought up because it is specified as the popup behavior.\r\n\r\nWe can solve both of these cases and reuse code by doing the actual navigation in the background script, just sending over the tab and window ids from the tab search page as a message.

        "body": "The problem with my previous suggestion is that when you close the tab search (in the case when it's in a new tab, called by hotkey) the browser defaults to going to the next left tab, not the one you opened tab search from. This messes up the `last_tab_id` when you navigate to the tab selected in search.\r\n\r\nSeparately, I also forgot to address the issue mentioned in my other comment: that it would be nice to preserve the old `last_tab_id` in the case that the user cancels the search (i.e. closes the search tab). (We don't have to worry about the popup case for this; the last tab will naturally be preserved because the popup isn't a tab.) Here are my new thoughts for fixing both of these. Unfortunately, I can't come up with a solution that doesn't require explicitly checking if the tab search is performed from a tab or from the popup, which is done by comparing the current tab as viewed by the tab search page and the background script after the tab search page is closed. There's gotta be a more elegant solution.\r\n\r\n### Hotkey flow\r\n\r\n1. The user presses the hotkey to open tab search in a new tab. The background script first saves the current tab as `search_launch_tab_id` before opening the tab search tab.\r\n2.\r\n    1. The user closes the tab search tab without making a selection. `last_tab_id` is unaffected and still correct. (Note: the user cannot close the tab search tab with a hotkey, as KeepTabs isn't running on its own pages. So they cannot close the tab in a way that updates `last_tab_id`.)\r\n    2. The user selects a tab to navigate to. The tab search page sends a message to the background script with the tab and window id of the selection, as well as the current tab's id (in this flow, it is the id of *the tab search tab*). The background script navigates to the selected tab with the common function `navigateToTab` (this wrongly sets `last_tab_id` to whatever tab happened to be active after the tab search tab closed), then corrects by setting `last_tab_id = search_launch_tab_id`. All is well.\r\n\r\n### Popup flow\r\n\r\n1. The user clicks the KeepTabs extension icon to open tab search in a popup window.\r\n2.\r\n    1. The user clicks outside the popup window to close it without making a selection. No KeepTabs code runs as a result of this so everything remains fine.\r\n    2. The user selects a tab to navigate to. The tab search page sends a message to the background script with the tab and window id of the selection, as well as the current tab's id (in this flow, it is the id of *the tab on which the popup is open*). The background script navigates to the selected tab with the common function `navigateToTab` (this correctly sets `last_tab_id`). By comparing the current tab id sent by the tab search page and the current tab id now obtained by another query (actually this must occur before the `navigateToTab` call of course) and seeing that they are equal, the background script knows the search was performed in the popup and doesn't correct the `last_tab_id`."

Because the `navigateToTab` call involves an asynchronous API call, it's actually setting the `last_tab_id` (incorrectly) after we've made the correction to `search_launch_tab_id`. I should've thought it's dangerous to put an asynchronous call anywhere but last in a code block if I want to assume it's done by the next line. To fix this, I'll actually navigate to `search_launch_tab_id` before making the `navigateToTab` call. This is essentially the idea of two comments above -- having the tab search tab close and return back to the original tab it was opened from."

I'm now realizing that because I used `createNewTab` which updates `last_tab_id` to open the tab search tab, we actually lose the correct `last_tab_id` from before we launched tab search. But, now that I see it, I actually like this behavior better. Because when the user manually closes the tab search tab, the browser plops them down on whatever tab was to the left of it, and then they can return to the original launching tab with the previous tab hotkey, which makes sense. The alternative is weird because they would return to the tab before the launching tab with the previous tab hotkey, and then not be able to get back to the launching tab (`last_tab_id` would now be the random tab they were plopped down on)."
