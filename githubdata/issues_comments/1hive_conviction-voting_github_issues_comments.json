        "body": "> My question is, from a user experience point of view, is it useful for users to have that many tokens with different thresholds in just one interface? Which is the general use case? Proposers are going to ask for that different range of tokens or just one (probably DAI?).\r\n\r\nI know that at the hackathon we had leaned towards supporting multiple assets, but I think the general use case is probably that one token/currency will be used for proposals. And in the event that an org would support multiple assets, it probably would be a relatively small list, eg DAI and Organization Tokens. \r\n\r\n> We can also cover the general use case by installing the conviction voting many times, and specify on each of them the token it is going to be requested (similar to the Token Manager app).\r\n\r\nAgreed, if we decide to just support one token (set at initialization), it would be reasonable to install multiple instances of the app. \r\n\r\n> Does it make sense, or do you prefer a single app with an integrated interface for managing all the tokens? \r\n\r\nI'm comfortable with simplifying things (both technically and from a UX perspective) by choosing to only support a single asset for each instance of conviction voting. \ud83d\udc4d\r\n"

As you can see in the conviction formula ![y_{i+1}=x+\\alpha%20y_{i}](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y_{i+1}=x+\\alpha%20y_{i}), we calculate conviction (![y_{i+1}](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y_{i+1})) from last conviction (![y_{i}](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y_{i})) and the tokens staked on a certain time  (![x](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x)). On #16 what we do is to avoid a loop to calculate conviction for each block if the stake is constant (which saves a lot of gas), but when somebody stakes or withdraws, we have to plug the result of the last formula into the ![y_{i}](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y_{i}) of a new one that uses the new amount of tokens staked.\r\n\r\nThis is why we save the last conviction and last block on each stake and withdraw, because if we calculate the total conviction on the last step, we would need to loop over all stakes and withdraws, being vulnerable to an out of gas attack.\r\n\r\nBut please, if you see any other possible improvement in the code tell me."

Having too many stale proposals may make this process slower, but not much slower, so I don't think it's a technical requirement to close proposals.\r\n\r\nRegarding UX reasons, I think that many proposals can be outdated in a short period of time because they have a deadline, such as \"Preparing an Aragon event during the Devcon\". After the Devcon, this proposal have not any more sense, so maybe we have to conceive Conviction Voting for proposals that can be done at any time, such as the development of an app / DAO (such as conviction voting or CRDAO), or the direction a project should take (such as going for an Arachain).\r\n\r\nI would issue the first conviction voting version without the cancelling option and see what happens. We don't have to [optimize prematurely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_optimization#When_to_optimize), and we can always add this feature later.\r\n\r\nHowever, I would keep this issue active in order to get more feedback from the rest of the community."

Using something like the ERC-888 token standard, we can allow tokens to be automatically asserted towards proposals, without affecting token liquidity with staking locks. Since your preferences are expressed as a percentage of your token holdings, any change to your token holdings (through buying or selling) automatically updates the weight of your preference.\r\n\r\nI still have to check out [ERC-888: The Multidimensional Token Standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/888), and see how we can use it in this case."
