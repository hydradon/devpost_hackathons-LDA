I am free on Sat and Sun this week.\r\nI will post more stuffs that I've been working on to our GitHub including the contents that I've sent to you over the email or discussed in previous meetings. I can't wait to see yours too. I guess the more stuffs we put on here, the faster we can construct our slides (and easier to finish the April Milestone)\r\n\r\nChristine, would you help us by creating a new issue for our next group meeting and include the room info there!

Upon entering the room the nurse\u2019s badge changes colors and then chirps to remind the nurse that hand hygiene is required.  Once hands are sanitized, the badge illuminates a bright green hand symbol which signals to all that the hands are clean.  During the past two months, staff hand-washing compliance on two test units at the hospital are now routinely maintained near 100 percent (99% and 97%), a level never before attained by a hospital, especially with this type of visibility and precision.  While it\u2019s still too early to determine if the findings are statistically significant, the initial results are very exciting and the hospital plans to continue with the testing to collect more data and conduct final research statistics.\r\n> \r\n> The collaborative test phase for the system, developed by Biovigil Hygiene Technologies in Ann Arbor, Mich., began last April at SSM St. Mary\u2019s Health Center in St. Louis as their first test site. A tiny computer and built-in sensor technology in the badge detects chemical vapors from alcohol-based hand washing solutions used throughout the hospital (think of it as a tiny smoke detector designed to detect clean hands).  When going in or out of a patient\u2019s room, the badge cycles through a series of color changes from green to flashing yellow to flashing red. Green means clean.  To return the badge to the green (clean) status, a staff member simply places their sanitized hands close to the badge as they are drying \u2013 proudly called \u201cpledging the badge.\u201d  Each \u201cpledge\u201d is recorded electronically via a web-based information system.**"

The primary cost is that patients with hospital-acquired infections have their stay prolonged, during which time they occupy scarce bed-days and require additional diagnostic and therapeutic interventions (2). Estimates of the cost of these infections, in 2002 prices, suggest that the annual economic burden is $6.7 billion per year in the United States (3)1 and \u00a31.06 billion (approximately $1.7 billion) in the United Kingdom (4)."

        "body": "From:\r\nWachter, Robert M. Understanding patient safety. New York: McGraw-Hill Medical, 2008.\r\n\r\nTHE ISSUE LANDSCAPE:\r\n+ According to Harvard Medical Practice Study (IOM : To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System), in late 1980s, there were about 44,000 to 98,000 Americans die each year from medical errors which equals to one jumbo jet crashing each and everyday in the US.\r\n+ Attempted strategies : improved ratios of providers to \"customers\" / Decrease provider fatigue / Improve teamwork and communication / Use of simulators / Executive walk rounds / Bar coding\r\n+ Famous cases : Betsy Lehman died of a chemotherapy overdose (1994) / Willie King has the wrong leg amputated (1995) / Two healthy young volunteers (Jesse Gelsinger and Ellen Roche) died while participating in research studies (1999 and 2001) / 18-month old Josie King died of dehydration in hospital (2001) / Jesica Santillan died after receiving a heart-lung transplant of the wrong blood type (2003) >> all happened at famous hospitals. Ref Page 5 or internet.\r\n+ Issues with error reporting : Few doctors report errors officially. Timing of reports may not correspond to actual rate of error. Some tools are expensive. Some tools are subjected to bias\r\n+ Observation of patient care method : potentially accurate and precise. Provides data otherwise unavailable. Detects more active errors than other methods. CONS: difficult to train reliable observers, potential concerns about confidentiality. Possible to overwhelemed with information. Time consuming and expensive\r\n+ Slips V.S. Mistakes : Slips represent the greater threat because most of the tasks are automatic with little interactions with \"customers\" >> prevent by building in redundancies with standardization and simplification\r\n+ A large healthcare system will have to handle the data 5 times greater than NASDAQ (on daily basis)\r\n+ Tracking of information is a huge challenge consider the balance of privacy and different institutions a person go to over a long period of time\r\n+ The issue of presenting only relevant information to a particular case \r\n"

Reduce medical errors by 55% if combined with a decision support system\r\n   . Can automatically raise red-flags\r\n   . More advantages are in table 13-2, pg 140\r\n   . Issues with time delays/gaps in medication delivery (system down time, outdated database of drugs)\r\n+ Bar coding and Radio frequency identification systems\r\n   . Prevent data entry errors\r\n   . Issues with costs (RFID), multiple drugs from different patients in one cart\r\n+ Smart intravenous pumps\r\n+ Computerized decision support\r\n   . Provides alerts on drug-drug, drug-allergy, drug-lab interactions\r\n   . Provide alerts when patient vital signs go out of certain parameters\r\n   .

        "body": "Team,\r\n\r\nBased on the recent results of our surveys, I did a little bit more research on the issue and here is what I found.\r\n\r\n+ Human factor engineering\r\nAccording to our survey, one of the main reasons why HAI occurred is because the nurses have many things to do or trainers were not completely aware of all potential issues, mistakes that are overlooked. This video gives an example of how easy it is to overlook the human factor https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9aD-bBx8TA\r\n\r\nSo I think about ways to improve their work flows and it turns out that it is an extremely complicated problem. This evidence table shows the past efforts and various results when people try to improve quality of care by changing work flows (in most cases, by employing new information technologies) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK2638/table/ch31.t1/?report=objectonly\r\n\r\n+ Time motion study\r\nLooks like lots of improvements can be made to improve work flows if time-motion studies are done and done correctly. For example, is the position of med vault optimal for nurses? Why a nurse took a patient in and out of a X-ray room 2 times ? With time motion study, we can look at what happened before a HAI occurred. I will have to look more into that. \r\n\r\nExtra links:\r\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK2638/\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QgK07J3gio\r\n"
