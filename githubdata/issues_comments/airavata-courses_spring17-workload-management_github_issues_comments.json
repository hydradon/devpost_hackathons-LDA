Workers will not have the freedom to pull tasks - which might cause the risk of duplicate task processing by multiple workers for same task.\r\n- If a task needs concurrent execution on multiple instances, scheduler takes care of it. Eg: same task needs to run concurrently twice on either same worker/different worker. \r\n"

        "body": "The reason why I opted for Neo4j is because for our theme we basically need a database to store DAGs (perfectly suits our need).\r\nIf we go with a relational database, extracting relation between nodes would mean a lot of table joins. \r\nThese operations are compute and memory-intensive and have an exponential cost.\r\nOn the other hand, graph databases involve first class support for \u201crelationships\".\r\n\r\nEach node in the graph database model directly and physically contains a list of relationship-records that represent its relationships to other nodes. These relationship records are organized by type and direction and may hold additional attributes. Whenever you run the equivalent of a JOIN operation in graph database, the database just uses this list and has direct access to the connected nodes, eliminating the need for a expensive search / match computation. We would be having a lot of DAGs in our case and thus would involve a lot of join operations which might make our queries too long. Cypher on the other hand uses vastly less code than SQL. Adding/editing DAGs would be easier with cypher.\r\n\r\nWe also have an option of deconstructing JSON and inserting it into Neo4j by just using plain Cypher."

That is, the scheduler does not push the tasks to the worker, but rather publishes the task to be performed to a specific queue (which each worker subscribes). The only disadvantage I see with this approach is that the scheduler is not aware of the workers (attributes and which task it is executing), and there is no custom scheduler logic as mentioned in previous comment. Nevertheless, this approach does serve the purpose of getting the workers run the tasks, but with the aforementioned limitations."
